Id,Mixed Meaning
4000EEW_B01_U01_0001,"<ul><li>When you agree with someone, you share the same opinion, feeling, or purpose, like when you agree on the movie you will go see on Saturday afternoon.</li><li>If we were living in 12th century France, we might use the phrase a gré to describe things that are favorable or go well for us. This positive outcome is still part of the verb agree, because if people agree with you, your plan or idea is the one that will be used. In grammar, subjects and verbs agree when they are both singular or both plural. For example, ""everyone is here"" agrees but ""everyone are here"" does not.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0002,"<ul><li>Alcohol is a distilled or fermented drink that can make you drunk. Beer, wine and vodka are all kinds of alcohol.</li><li>Scientifically, alcohol is a liquid made up of distilled hydrocarbons that's also known as ethyl alcohol or ethanol — the same stuff found in solvents and car fuel. At the bar, alcohol is something you drink (as long as you're at least 21). Alcoholic beverages like whiskey and lager are produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugar and starches and have the power to make a person intoxicated.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0003,"<ul><li>To arrive is to come to a destination. When you arrive in Paris, the first thing you should do is go and buy a croissant.</li><li>The word arrive generally means to come to a physical destination, like a place. Make sure you arrive home on time for dinner! But it can also be less literal. You can arrive at a conclusion or a decision after much thought. You can also use arrive to mean ""achieve great success,"" though for whatever reason, this specific usage tends to be in the past tense. If you serve champagne and caviar at a party, your snobby aunt might comment, ""My dear, you’ve arrived!” In this case, arrive means to come to a place of great wealth or success.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0004,"<ul><li>August is not just the eighth month of the year; it also describes something esteemed or regal. The 200-year-old newspaper covering the royal wedding might be called an august institution.</li><li>The month August was named for Augustus Caesar who was an important and regal person. This is an easy way to remember the two meanings. Interestingly enough, linguists think that the word august did not descend from the same root as the month August. Find that hard to believe? August sources disagree. Oh, and don't forget to pronounce each word properly — the month has the accent on the first syllable, the adjective on the second.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0005,"<ul><li>A boat is a water craft, a vessel that floats and can be propelled through the water. If you buy a private island, you'll need a boat to get there.</li><li>A lobster boat travels across ocean bays powered by a small motor, and a sail boat is moved by the wind hitting its sails at a particular angle. A much smaller type of boat is a gravy boat, a boat-shaped serving dish that holds a sauce. Boat is sometimes used as a verb, meaning ""to go out in a boat."" The Old English root is bat, ""ship or vessel,"" from a Germanic source.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0006,
4000EEW_B01_U01_0007,"<ul><li>A camera records images in the form of photographs, film or video. If you want evidence that you've spotted Bigfoot in the woods behind your house, you'll need a camera.</li><li>The noun camera typically refers to a film or digital device that captures still pictures when you press a button. A film camera stores images on a strip of film that must be developed with special chemicals, while a digital camera keeps them on a memory card, and with the help of a computer you can see the pictures almost instantly. The original meaning of camera, ""vaulted building,"" came from Latin via the Greek root kamera, ""vaulted chamber.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0008,"<ul><li>Capital is the total amount of money (and things with a monetary value, like houses or cars) that a person or institution owns. A bank's capital might be in the billions, while your capital barely makes it into the hundreds.</li><li>Capital comes from the Latin capitalis, or ""head,"" which some would argue is the command center of your body. Because your head is so important, capital, as a noun and as an adjective, has come to refer to the primary or chief example of something — whether it's money, a letter, a crime, or the national or state seat of a government. It can be easily confused with the American word capitol, which refers to the buildings where government activities take place.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0009,"<ul><li>When you catch something, you grasp it or seize it in your hands, the way you catch a basketball when your friend throws it to you.</li><li>As a verb, catch describes grabbing and holding on. Adding the preposition on means you understand something, like when you catch on to your little brother's scheme to get out of doing chores, or to describe something that's getting popular, like a pop song that catches on then becomes a huge hit. If someone tells you there's a catch, it means there is a complication, but if a person is a catch, he or she makes a good romantic partner.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0010,"<ul><li>A duck is a bird that spends much of its life on or near water. You can sometimes see whole families of ducks paddling across lakes and ponds.</li><li>Ducks can be wild or domesticated — if you keep ducks in your yard, you'll need to provide them with at least a small body of water. When the word duck is a verb, it means ""to bow or dip suddenly,"" like when your kite plunges suddenly and you duck to avoid getting hit in the head. You can duck figuratively, too: ""Don't you dare duck out of helping me clean up after the party!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0011,"<ul><li>To enjoy something is to take delight or pleasure in something: to have fun doing it. Whatever you like or love, you enjoy.</li><li>Saying you enjoy something is a major compliment: it means you like it, and it makes you happy. Some people enjoy sports; others enjoy music. TV, movies, books, video games, sunny days, pets, and exercise are enjoyed by many people. Different people enjoy different things. We can also talk about enjoying as a type of advantage. A tall boxer enjoys an advantage because he has a longer reach than a short boxer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0012,"<ul><li>When you invite a friend to do something, you request her company, or encourage her to come with you. You might invite a group of neighbors to help you throw a block party.</li><li>You could invite your friend to join you on a road trip, or invite your parents to your art show at a local gallery. You're making a polite request. Similarly, a newspaper might invite readers' comments, or a school might invite ideas for how to spend grant money. Invite is also casual shorthand for ""invitation."" When you tempt someone to react, you also invite that reaction: ""Your strange film really invites harsh criticism.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0013,"<ul><li>How can we love our partners, our parents, sunsets at the beach, cats, and Fridays? The types of love listed here mean different things — but what remains is the certainty, at least for now, that what you love is what you adore.</li><li>Love is an expression of emotion. Love, it is said, can make you walk miles barefoot in the rain just to see the person you can't stop thinking about. Or, it can make you cross the street because the store ""you love"" is located there. Love is a versatile word — like what it describes. Love takes many forms, but the word typically describes an affection that is deep and emotional. If you say you’re “in love,” that tends to refer to the romantic kind of love.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0014,"<ul><li>A year is divided into twelve months, starting with January and ending with December. If it takes you a month to read a book, it takes approximately thirty days.</li><li>A month is a unit of time that corresponds to the phases of the moon — which is the reason the word month, which comes from the Proto-Germanic menoth, is closely related to the word moon, whose root is menon. People have kept track of days this way since Paleolithic times, and even those who don't use the Gregorian, twelve-month calendar, still divide a year into months based on the moon.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0015,"<ul><li>To travel is the act of going from one place to another, usually a considerable distance. Your daily commute in the morning doesn't generally count as travel. Your trip to Timbuktu? That counts.</li><li>Travel can also be used as a noun — as in your travels to Timbuktu. Or perhaps you prefer time travel or space travel. Objects that are especially adapted for use when you travel are often modified by the word travel; for example, a ""travel-bag,"" ""travel- games,"" or a ""travel iron."" And if something is particularly popular in another country or culture from its place of origin, say a cheese, a wine, or a type of music, it's said to ""travel well.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0016,"<ul><li>When something is typical, it is common, regular, expected — hanging out with friends and playing computer games are typical activities of American teens.</li><li>To be typical is to be of a type, meaning that a person or thing has the same characteristics of everyone or everything else in the group, like a typical student, trying to talk the teacher out of giving homework over break. Something that is typical is what you can expect, like reading a guidebook about a faraway country you will visit to learn the typical weather and kinds of food you will encounter while you are there.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0017,"<ul><li>When you travel to another place, or spend some time at a friend's house, it's a visit. You should visit your grandmother! It's been a while since she's had a visit from you.</li><li>Whenever you spend a temporary amount of time with another person or in another place, that's a visit — whether it's your visit to San Francisco or your visit to the doctor for a checkup. In some parts of the U.S., visit is also a name for a chat: ""I had a nice visit with your Aunt Sylvia yesterday."" And if you pay a visit to someone, you go see them for a while.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0018,"<ul><li>Weather is the atmospheric conditions, including the temperature, wind, snow, rain, or anything else happening outside. People tend to talk about the weather when they can't think of anything else to talk about.</li><li>In some places, people say, ""Don't like the weather? Wait an hour and it'll change."" Every day, experts try to predict the weather, but they never get it exactly right. You can also use weather to mean ""endure something,"" as in ""I weathered the storm at work."" That's not a real storm, but a stormy situation. Even though the weather drives us all crazy at times, at least it gives us something to blab about.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0019,"<ul><li>Seven days make up one week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. If you won't see your friend again until next Thursday, you can say, ""See you next week!""</li><li>Before the adoption of the Roman calendar, a week was more of a vague kind of change or succession, like the turning of a full moon to a half moon, for example. The modern week is strictly calendar-related, and seven days long, unless you're talking about a ""work week"" or a ""school week,"" as in ""I have Friday off, so my school week ends tomorrow!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U01_0020,
4000EEW_B01_U02_0021,"<ul><li>An adventure is an exciting and probably risky trip, effort, or undertaking. Let's go explore the jungle! Don't be scared — it'll be an adventure!</li><li>To a kid from the city, a ride on the subway is just another trip across town. To a kid from the suburbs, though, it can be a real adventure — a trip to a strange place with all sorts of strange people, new sights, and surprising twists and turns. If you've ever been to the Great Adventure amusement park, you know that the whole place is designed to make you feel as though you're on a wild, exciting, and thrilling trip — a great adventure. People often go on an adventure hoping something wonderful will come of it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0022,"<ul><li>To approach is to get near something. An airplane is cleared for a final approach just as the wheels approach the landing strip.</li><li>Approach comes from the Latin word appropriare which means ""go nearer to."" You can physically approach something, like a waiter going to a table. Or, you can approach a subject, usually one you're a little nervous about — like a new employee might approach her boss about getting a raise. Time can also approach, like winter, midnight, or even old age.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0023,"<ul><li>Carefully means cautiously or painstakingly. If you carefully study your vocabulary words, you'll ace your next quiz!</li><li>This adverb comes from the Old English carfullice — but before coming to mean ""in a way that avoids harm,"" it meant ""sorrowfully."" In fact, the very oldest meaning of care was ""to be anxious or to grieve."" These days, you don't cry when you do something carefully. You just take your time and make sure you're doing it right and that no one's being harmed by it, like when you check carefully behind your car for the neighbor's cat before you back out of the driveway.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0024,"<ul><li>A chemical is any mix of raw elements: hydrogen + oxygen produce the chemical water. Water is created by a change in the chemistry of hydrogen and oxygen atoms — a chemical change.</li><li>Be cautious of the negative reaction people have to chemical substances. Chemicals often bring to mind deadly substances, such as asbestos or deadly chemical weapons. But many chemicals are part of our everyday life. Our lives would be drastically different without chemical compounds — think of the infection that would result if we didn't have the chemical hydrogen peroxide for cleaning out cuts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0025,"<ul><li>To create simply means to make or bring into existence. Bakers create cakes, ants create problems at picnics, and you probably created a few imaginary friends when you were little.</li><li>Similar to conceive and spawn and the exact opposite of destroy, create is a word that often implies a little bit of imagination. In fact, it takes a lot of creativity to create something spectacular; that is, unless you're a robot, and then your creations occur automatically. Or Mother Nature, where creation just happens naturally: Birds create nests, the tides create waves, and snowstorms create days off from school.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0026,"<ul><li>Evil is the opposite of good. We usually think of villains as evil — wrong, immoral and nasty on many levels — and heroes as good.</li><li>This word is often reserved for our most terrible crimes and criminals: Adolf Hitler is usually the face of evil in history, while Voldemort is that face in recent literature. Evil can be less extreme, meaning simply anything that brings harm; we can talk about the evils of alcohol or the evils of power. When both major candidates for President seem lame, people often say they're choosing between the lesser of two evils. Not all evils are equally evil.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0027,"<ul><li>If you see your science-loving neighbor headed home with a power cord, a handful of test tubes, a stopwatch, and a bag of potatoes, there’s probably no need to be alarmed. There’s a good chance he’s only conducting an experiment, a scientific test conducted under controlled conditions.</li><li>To refer to a scientific test, use the noun experiment. If you want to describe the work done in conducting such a test, experiment will do the trick as well, since it can also act as a verb, as in ""scientists experiment with helium."" You can also use it more generally to describe trying a new method or idea. For example, you could experiment with a new hairstyle or different routes to get to school or work.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0028,"<ul><li>To kill is to end the life of some living being or something else. So, you could kill a deer by shooting it with a hunting rifle or kill a bill by voting against it.</li><li>Hunters kill animals for their meat, and drivers sometimes kill an animal accidentally, or inadvertently kill a plant, simply by forgetting to water it. Certain inanimate things are also said to kill, like poison or disease or drunk driving. In each of these cases, death is caused and life is taken. You can also kill figuratively, as when a school board kills the foreign language program or a thunderstorm kills your hopes of a picnic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0029,"<ul><li>A laboratory is a place where experiments happen, usually scientific experiments involving chemicals and lab coats, but there are creative and athletic laboratories too, where people experiment with writing and footballs.</li><li>When you think of a laboratory, you might see men and women wearing face masks pouring colorful liquids into test tubes, and you’d be correct.  Any place that is a testing ground for new ideas is a laboratory, like a class full of people thinking up new ways to make paper airplanes.  The Latin verb laborare means “to labor,” so remember that a laboratory is a place of hard work: you can’t spell laboratory without labor in it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0030,"<ul><li>To let out a chuckle or giggle is to laugh: people laugh when something is funny.</li><li>To chortle, cackle, guffaw, or titter is to laugh. The job of a comedian is to make people laugh. Often people laugh at things that aren't supposed to be funny, and people also laugh to be polite. If something is silly, you can say ""That's a laugh!"" If you had fun at a party, you can say ""Thanks for the laughs."" Everybody's laugh sounds a little different. It would be a shame if your laugh sounded like Elmer Fudd.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0031,"<ul><li>The adjective loud describes a noise that has a very high volume, like loud music at a concert that kept your ears ringing even after you left.</li><li>The word loud comes from the Old English word hlud, which means ""making noise, sonorous.""Loud is most often used to describe the volume level of music, but it can also refer to voices or other sounds that are unpleasant and high-volumed. Loud can also describe a tasteless or showy fashion choice, like a loud Hawaiian shirt paired with bright orange shorts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0032,"<ul><li>You know that queasy, uneasy feeling you get before a test? That's a nervous feeling. Everyone gets nervous sometimes.</li><li>Being nervous is a major part of life that everyone has to deal with at times. Some people are more nervous than others, but we all get nervous about certain things — for example, having to perform in front of a crowd makes most people nervous. Getting interviewed for a job is a nervous experience. When the stock market keeps going up or down, you could say it's a nervous stock market. Nervous also applies to the body's nervous system, which includes your brain, spinal cord, and the nerves throughout your body. If you think you injured your nervous system, that's a good reason to be nervous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0033,"<ul><li>A noise is any sound. Often, it means a sound people don't like, like the noise of traffic or a barking dog.</li><li>When someone yells ""What is that noise?!"" you can be sure they're not happy about what they're hearing. They mean noise as anything too loud or annoying. When it comes to music, people often disagree on what's noise and what isn't. Your noise might be another person's lullaby. A car siren will wake you up, but some noises can be soothing. ""White noise"" is an electronically generated sound often used to help someone fall asleep.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0034,"<ul><li>A project is a piece of work that is planned or intended. Plan a little extra time for your gingerbread house project — gluing the walls and roof can take a while.</li><li>If you call a person your project, pronounced PRAH-jekt, it means you are trying to improve them by telling them how to behave, etc. As a verb, pronounced pro-JEKT, it means to jut out literally — The fireplace projects into the dining room — or figuratively — Try to project your ideas forcefully. If you assume another person is feeling the same things you are, you are projecting your feelings onto them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0035,"<ul><li>Scare is a verb that means frighten or intimidate. You might be embarrassed to admit that you don't want to go to the beach with your friends because of how much seagulls scare you.</li><li>Questions on a test you're unprepared for might scare you, and so might a barking dog. To scare is to spook, startle, or cause fear, and what scares your best friend most (like losing his job) might not be what would scare you more than anything (like discovering a huge snake in your shower). You can also use scare as a noun, as in ""It gave me such a scare when all my friends jumped out and yelled, 'Surprise!'""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0036,"<ul><li>A secret is something you don’t want everybody to know, like your secret crush on the bus driver. A secret can also be a mystery known to only a few — the secret of the lost pyramid.</li><li>There might be a secret passageway in your basement that only you know about. You could have a secret passion for Japanese anime comics and share that secret with only your closest friends. If you're ""in on a secret"" — plans for a surprise birthday party, for instance — that means you're in the inner circle of people in the know. Everybody has to keep the secret, or the party won't be a surprise.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0037,
4000EEW_B01_U02_0038,"<ul><li>Smell is one of your five senses—the one you use your nose for. Dogs have such a sharp sense of smell that they can sniff out things like explosives and drugs.</li><li>Your sense of smell gives you important information, like ""this milk is sour,"" or ""I need a shower."" An individual odor or scent is also a smell, and to perceive it with your nose is to smell it. If someone says, ""You smell,"" it's not a compliment—what they mean is, ""You don't smell good."" While experts believe that smell has an Old English root, it was never recorded.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0039,"<ul><li>The original meaning of terrible was anything that causes terror. That meaning still applies, but mostly this is a word for anything really bad.</li><li>Terrible used to be reserved for things that caused fear and terror, but today we use the word to describe anything awful, lousy, or just plain bad. People like saying ""That movie was terrible!"" or ""The Yankees are terrible!"" If you get a D on a test, you might tell your friends the test (or teacher) is terrible. Or you might also say, ""I am terrible at taking tests.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U02_0040,"<ul><li>Worse means ""not as good as something else"" or ""changed negatively,"" like a sore throat that is getting worse, meaning it hurts more now.</li><li>Worse comes from the Old Saxon word werran or ""to entangle, compound."" To compound is to add to, so if troubles, complication, or anything else that entangles are added to a situation, it will get worse. Remember that worse is used to compare two things, such as ""now"" and ""before,"" while worst compares three or more things. You might use worse than yesterday, but this doesn't make it the worst cold you ever had.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0041,"<ul><li>Something that's alien is different or foreign. In science fiction, space aliens come from other planets.</li><li>When we talk about aliens, or things that are alien, we're talking about things and people that are different and strange to us — like an alien from outer space. Some people refer to undocumented immigrants as ""aliens,"" but nowadays, the term is often considered dehumanizing. Besides people, experiences can be alien. If you've never owned a cat, then having a cat is alien to you. You can also alienate people by making them feel weird, disconnected, and alone — like an alien.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0042,
4000EEW_B01_U03_0043,"<ul><li>Whether it's a kind of graph, a map, or even a piece of music, a chart is a visual display of information. As a verb, chart means to make that kind of display.</li><li>Some words' meanings grow narrower over the centuries. But in the case of chart, which comes from the French charte and Latin charta, ""map,"" the meanings have grown a lot since the 1500s. Now, chart is a noun meaning any visual index of information, as in ""that song is shooting up the charts."" It's also still a map, as in ""harbor chart."" And it's a verb, as in ""to chart your progress, make a chart.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0044,"<ul><li>A cloud is a clump of water vapor that you can see in the sky. Clouds are sometimes white and puffy, and other times so big and gray that they completely block the sun.</li><li>Clouds form when air rises and cools and the moisture in it condenses into a visible form. Any similar billowy mass is also a cloud, like a cloud of smoke over your campfire or a cloud of dust after your car peels out of the driveway. If you're gloomy or morose, someone might say there's a cloud over you — a figurative cloud of sadness. On the other hand, if you're ""on cloud nine,"" you couldn't be happier.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0045,"<ul><li>To describe is to report details about something either out loud or in writing. ""Since we can't come to Paris with you, please describe it in your letter!""</li><li>Describe is from the Latin word describere which means  ""to write down."" When you describe something, you're ""da"" scribe, the person writing things down! Writing teachers love to have students describe, using lots of details using the five senses and figurative language. It doesn't have to be written down, though — you can also describe that gold dress you saw to your friend on the phone. Or you can describe a circle, by sketching it out with a stick in the sand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0046,
4000EEW_B01_U03_0047,"<ul><li>The verb fail describes something that stops working, like brakes in a car that fail, or is found to be unacceptable, like restaurants that fail their inspection for cleanliness.</li><li>The verb fail comes from the Old French word faillir, meaning “be lacking,” “miss,” or “not succeed.” You can fail an exam, which means you didn't get at least a minimum number of points to pass. You can fail to live up to your potential, meaning you aren't able to meet expectations. When businesses fail, it means  financial problems force them to close.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0048,"<ul><li>Grade means ""to evaluate or rank,"" like teachers who grade their students or a food inspector who grades a crop, determining whether it is ""food-grade.""</li><li>Grade can be both a noun and a verb. The verb form is used when you grade something, meaning you assign it a value. The actual mark assigned is the noun version of the word grade, such as an A or B. The noun grade can be used to indicate the rank or quality of other items as well, like professional-grade cookware. Grade can also describe the slope of a mountain or road, like a steep grade that is dangerous in bad weather.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0049,"<ul><li>The adverb instead means in place of or as a substitute for something else. If your best friend has a temper tantrum every time you play miniature golf, maybe next time you should go to the movies instead.</li><li>The adverb instead was originally two words, ""in stead,"" with ""stead"" coming from stede, the Old English word for place. The adverb instead can also mean rather than, and in this context it's usually followed by ""of."" Instead of worrying about the weather for your vacation, which is beyond your control, you should worry about whether you packed everything you need.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0050,"<ul><li>A library is a place where collections of books are kept. If you ever want a reminder of how very much there is to learn in this world, pay a visit to your local library.</li><li>The noun library, meaning, “a room or building where books are housed,” comes from the Latin librarium “chest for books.” That, in turn, evolved from the Latin liber, a word meaning “book, paper, parchment,” and, more literally, “the inner bark of trees.” The writer Jorge Luis Borges said, “I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.” What would your vision of paradise look like?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0051,"<ul><li>When you take a picture with a camera, the result is a photograph, a picture of your subject created by a special medium’s exposure to light. The first photographs were created on metal plates coated with a special chemical.</li><li>Although photography as we know it did not emerge until the 19th century, the word photograph evolved from the ancient Greek words phot-, ""light,"" and graph-, ""writing,"" which were combined to create the word for taking pictures — ""light writing."" Nowadays we take our photographs with electronic cameras, recording, transferring, and storing the pictures digitally. Times change, and while many people still enjoy using film cameras, they are becoming increasingly rare, and certain types of films are no longer produced.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0052,"<ul><li>A planet is a celestial body that revolves around a star. In our solar system, Earth is the third planet from the sun.</li><li>The word planet comes from the Greek planetes, which means ""wanderer."" Since ancient times, people have been fascinated by the wandering of celestial bodies in the night sky. If a variety of factors come together so that something works out well for you, you can say that the planets aligned. You parents weren't sure if your family was going to be able to go on vacation, but then the planets aligned and off to Florida you were.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0053,"<ul><li>When you report something, you tell what happened.  After giving the details of your groundbreaking news story, you might end by saying, “...reporting live from Washington, D.C.”</li><li>In addition to the action of telling, what gets told is also called a report.  Your report on annual snowfall in New Mexico was brief but informative.  Report also applies to calling the police or other authorities.  You might not like the way your neighbor trims his poodle, but that doesn't mean you should report him for animal abuse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0054,"<ul><li>Two is a ""couple"" and more than two or three is several. If you eat four donuts you can say you had several but you may have had too many — especially if you get a stomach-ache.</li><li>Several is a word that shows size or number when you can’t be specific or when you want to summarize. If three, four, or five of you hang out, then you're spending time with several friends. Inviting 30 people over and telling your parents that several friends stopped by would be stretching the truth and you might get grounded. For how many weeks? Possibly several.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0055,"<ul><li>The form of something gives it its shape. Basic shapes include the square, the circle, and the triangle. You may have a nose the shape of a ski slope.</li><li>When you admire someone's shape, you're admiring their form, or their body. When you're out of shape or vowing to get back into shape, you're using shape to refer to your physical stamina or overall health. You can shape something by giving it form, as in ""shape the dough into a braided twist,"" or influence someone, as in a teacher who shapes young minds.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0056,"<ul><li>To solve something is to find a solution, like figuring out the answer to a complex riddle.</li><li>The verb solve is often used in mathematics, and it means to answer a math problem. You can solve other, non-mathematical problems too — like the question of what to wear when you've run out of clean clothes (your sibling's clothes!). The word solve originally came from the Latin solvere, which meant ""to loosen or untie."" If you think of any kind of complex problem as a knot, then the original definition of solve still makes sense!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0057,"<ul><li>If you're walking on a crowded street and you stop suddenly — abruptly and without warning — somebody walking behind you may bump into you.</li><li>If you experience love at first sight, you've suddenly fallen in love. If you're driving at night and a deer jumps out in front of you, you might suddenly have to swerve to avoid it. Suddenly is the kind of adverb you might use a lot if you're describing the plot of an action movie, a mystery novel, or any story in which lots of unexpected things happen.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0058,"<ul><li>If you suppose you want to see that new horror movie, you may not be too sure. Suppose means to guess, think, or imagine something without absolute certainty. Best to hold off and watch something funny instead.</li><li>Suppose also has the meaning of assuming something hypothetical for the sake of argument. You might ask, ""Suppose someone breaks in while I'm away?"" Suppose also has the more technical (and often legal) sense of something you must take for granted if some other condition is to happen. Your theory might suppose the victim was home by 8:00. In this last sense, suppose introduces something that's a precondition.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0059,"<ul><li>To understand something is to comprehend or get it. The more we learn, the more we understand.</li><li>The goal of most education is to help students understand how the world works: history, math, English, music, science, and art are all complicated subjects that you need to practice and think about before you can really understand them. Understanding requires knowledge and thought. Another kind of understanding is like sympathy. For example, you might not approve of stealing, but you could understand why a guy would steal to feed his family.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U03_0060,"<ul><li>A view is a scene or vista that's visible from a certain point. If you think your hotel room has a view of the ocean, it'll be disappointing to open the blinds and discover your view of a Dumpster instead.</li><li>The range of what you can see is also called your view. When you're keeping an eye on kids at the beach, you try to keep them in your view. As a verb, view means to watch. It might be hard for you to sit still while you view a really scary movie, or even to keep from screaming out loud.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0061,"<ul><li>Something appropriate is correct and fits the situation. A sweater-vest with reindeer on it is appropriate holiday apparel, even if it's totally embarrassing.</li><li>The adjective appropriate is used when something is suitable or fitting. It comes from the Latin appropriare, which means ""to make something fit, to make something one's own."" Going back even further, appropriate is related to the Latin word proprius, ""to belong to a person, thing, or group."" Another appropriate way to use this word is as a verb, meaning to steal or seize something, the way you'd appropriate your sister's sandwich if she left it sitting near you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0062,"<ul><li>If you avoid drinking coffee right before bed because it tends to keep you awake and makes you jittery, that means that you stay away from coffee at night.</li><li>The verb avoid means to stop yourself from doing something or to keep something from happening. You might avoid the old lady next door who smells funny and always wants to pinch your cheek, or you could avoid a certain dangerous neighborhood in your city by taking a different route when you're walking home. It's easy to get avoid confused with a similar word, evade, which means ""to avoid in a particularly tricky or sneaky way.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0063,"<ul><li>The way you act or conduct yourself is how you behave. Teachers and parents often tell kids Behave!</li><li>If you follow rules and get along with others, you behave well, while if you are nasty and rude, you behave badly. Behave can suggest acting in a polite manner, as when you tell a child (or an adult) to behave in public. We usually behave differently in different situations — like when no one is watching. If you tell someone ""practice what you preach"" you are pointing out that the way they behave doesn't quite match up to their words.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0064,"<ul><li>Just saying the word calm reminds you of how it feels to be calm — steady, at rest, not agitated, chilled out, caaaaalllmmmm. Waters without waves? People without drama? Sounds calm.</li><li>Some synonyms of the adjective calm are peaceful and even-tempered. As a verb, it describes making someone steady and still — in other words, calm. Taking a walk or calling a friend might help you calm down when you are upset. As a noun, calm is a state of peace or stillness — the calm of your neighborhood at daybreak or the calm you seek when you exercise.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0065,"<ul><li>Concern is both a noun and a verb. As a noun it's something that you find particularly important. If you love pizza, getting the crust just so is a major concern during your pizza party.</li><li>Concern can also be something or someone that makes you upset or anxious, like your concern over the quality of the pizza crust. It can be a feeling of sympathy, like when your mom expresses concern over your obsession with pizza crust. As a verb, concern means to be relevant to something. Your main goal today may concern studying for your math test. Concern can also describe worry. When you stay out past curfew, your mom will be concerned.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0066,"<ul><li>If you feel content, you're satisfied and happy. The content of a book, movie, or song is what it's about: the topic.</li><li>This word has two main meanings. The first has to do with being pleased and satisfied (feeling content) or making someone else feel happy and at peace with things (contenting them). The other meaning has to do with subject matter: the content of a history class might be American history. The content of a math class might be geometry. As long as there's a topic or subject, there's content.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0067,"<ul><li>If you expect something, you think it’s going to happen. If you got up at 4 in the morning, you can expect to fall asleep earlier than usual tonight.</li><li>If you expect (or anticipate) something, you are fairly sure that it is coming, though you might not be totally certain. You might expect to graduate from a certificate program on time, barring unforeseen events that prevent you from going to class. If you say, simply, “I’m expecting,” people will assume you’re pregnant. Someone disappointed in you might shake his head and say, ""I expected more from you.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0068,"<ul><li>If you do something frequently, you do it repeatedly, again and again. If you frequently visit the cookie jar, you might gain some unwanted pounds.</li><li>Doctors and nurses have to wash their hands frequently, many times each day, since they touch various patients and don't want to spread germs. When you're driving in rush hour traffic, you usually find yourself stopping frequently. Things that occur over and over, especially in a relatively short time frame, happen frequently. The adverb frequently comes from the adjective frequent, which originally meant ""profuse or ample,"" from the Latin root frequentem, ""crowded or repeated.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0069,"<ul><li>Any action that you perform regularly as part of your routine can be called a habit. Flossing your teeth would be considered a good habit. Sucking your thumb would be considered a bad habit, especially as an adult.</li><li>On New Year's people always vow to break their bad habits, but bad habits die hard. The noun habit can also refer to an established custom — like the habit of breaking bread with your family every holiday. On a completely different note, clothing that is worn for horseback riding, or by a nun or monk, can also be called a habit. All good nuns should be in the habit of washing their habits.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0070,"<ul><li>This website is designed to instruct visitors about the meaning of words and their correct usage. To instruct is to give instructions, to teach.</li><li>Teachers are often called instructors because their job is to instruct, to give knowledge or instructions. The subtle difference between ""teach"" and instruct is that you can teach almost anything: concepts, ideas, theories or, say, history. When you instruct someone, you're giving them a set of tools or tasks to do something specific. That's why furniture, toys, and model rocket kits come with instructions: they instruct you how to assemble them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0071,"<ul><li>One copy of ""Celebrities are Cool"" magazine is an issue. It is issued, or put out, by the publisher. You and your mother may argue over the issue, or topic, of whether or not you should read it.</li><li>The original meaning of the word issue was to put something out. If a celebrity issues a statement or the post office issues new stamps, they put them out for the public. Likewise, an issue is a current topic, sometimes controversial, that is being discussed. Politicians often say they want to talk about the issues (and not their personal lives!). You might hear someone say, ""He's got issues"" about a person who has some problems, usually emotional ones, but this is a very new use for the word.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0072,"<ul><li>Use the word none to mean ""nothing,"" ""not any,"" or ""no one."" If you ate the last donut and your dad asks how many are left, it's up to you to break the sad news that there are none.</li><li>None comes from the Old English nan, ""not one,"" from ne, ""not"" and an, ""one."" This word is extremely useful. You can use it to mean ""zero,"" like when you had five apples and ate them all, and now you've got none. Or use it for ""no one,"" like when none of your friends showed up on time for your birthday party. If you had doubts about how to use this word, now you'll have none!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0073,"<ul><li>You are patient if you don't get frustrated or annoyed when you have to wait or deal with difficulties. The band director may show patient leadership, but a football coach uses other methods with his team.</li><li>It may be difficult to wait for something that takes a long time or deal with someone who is annoying, but if you are patient, you endure these things calmly and without frustration. Endure is the keyword here as patient comes from the Latin verb pati ""to suffer, endure."" Think of the patient way a chess player wins a game — calmly, steadily and willing to wait for the right time to act.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0074,"<ul><li>In the simplest sense, positive means good — or the opposite of negative. If you have a positive attitude about homework, for example, you're more likely to get positive feedback on your report card.</li><li>Keeping track of positive's many meanings can be positively confusing. For starters, if you're positive about something, you're totally sure. In math, any quantity greater than zero is positive. In medicine, a positive result on a test indicates the presence of a disease. And that isn't a very positive experience for anyone.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0075,"<ul><li>To punish is to discipline or penalize someone because they've done something wrong. If you stole the cookie from the cookie jar, someone may have to punish you. Not you? Then who?</li><li>A judge will often punish a guilty defendant with community service or parole — or sometimes even with time spent in prison, if the crime is serious enough. You probably punish your puppy for chewing your shoes simply with a firm ""No!"" Sometimes people are punished unfairly, like how higher gas prices punish the people who can already barely afford to drive to their jobs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0076,"<ul><li>Use the word represent when something stands in for something else — whether it's your congressman representing your interests in Washington or the thimble that represents you as it makes its way around the Monopoly board.</li><li>We live in a democracy in which we elect a few people to represent the wishes and desires of the rest of us. Their job is literally to ""re-present"" the voters' demands in Congress. That's why we call them our ""representatives."" In the world of art, however, to represent something can mean to express its essence by means of something different. For example a ball of string can represent, or symbolize, a cat.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B01_U04_0078,"<ul><li>When something is spread, it's stretched or extended as far as it can go. It's a beautiful sight to see a bald eagle spread its wings and fly.</li><li>When you spread a picnic blanket on the ground, you open it and stretch it across the grass. You can also see the ocean spread out in front of you, or spread butter on toast, for example. Any way you use it, spread implies an extension across some distance, a stretching of some sort. The expression spread too thin means you are having trouble finding the time and energy to do everything in your life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0079,"<ul><li>As a noun, a stroll is a leisurely walk. After a heavy meal, you may want to go out for a stroll to help you work off some of the calories. You also will take a stroll on your day off and the weather is nice.</li><li>The word stroll originally came to English through the German word strollen, which means to wander aimlessly. The word stroll can also be used as a verb meaning to take a leisurely walk in which you do some wandering. You may enjoy a stroll through the park, along the beach, or down the city streets — take your time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U04_0080,"<ul><li>A village is a place where people live that's smaller than a city or town. The village where your grandparents live might have a population of only a few hundred people.</li><li>In the US, some towns, townships, and cities have smaller villages communities within them. There are also villages that are independent of any larger areas. In either case, a village is typically larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town. The majority of Indians live in villages, while in other countries (like Russia and the UK) population has moved to big cities and suburbs, away from traditional villages. The Latin source of village is villa, or ""farm.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0081,"<ul><li>Something that is active is characterized by movement and action. That action might be a random or temporary movement, such as someone who is active and exercises only now and then, or something continuous, like an active strain of a virus.</li><li>Since the adjective active suggests activity, applying it to anything implies some sort of motion or action. A person might be physically active, not sitting around and doing nothing, or mentally active, working the mind. In language, we refer to ""the active voice"" as one in which the subject does the action, in contrast to the passive voice, a rather boring style where the subject is the receiver of the action. Even in writing, it’s better to be active!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0082,"<ul><li>Adult is noun and an adjective, both of which refer to something mature, no longer a child. A full-grown person is called an adult: they can vote, rent cars, and choose to eat sugary cereal for dinner every night.</li><li>If you're still a child, then you are not an adult — that's the noun version. Childish people don't behave in an adult manner — that's the adjective. A child might be scared by the Wicked Witch of the West, but an adult knows she's not real. Learning the difference between real life and make-believe is one of the upsides of becoming an adult.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0083,"<ul><li>Your age is the number of years you've been alive. If your cat is six, you can say that he's ""six years of age.""</li><li>You can also talk about a stage of life or an era in history as an age: ""School age kids need to get outside and play every day."" Often when someone mentions age as a concept or idea, they mean old age, or being elderly. And the verb age means ""grow older."" The word comes from the Old French aage, ""age or lifetime,"" from the Latin root aevum, ""lifetime, eternity, or age.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0084,"<ul><li>When something is not good, it's bad. A bad dog goes to the bathroom in the house, and bad milk has gone sour.</li><li>Bad has slightly different meanings depending on what it's describing, but the overall idea is the same: not good. If you get a bad connection on the telephone, there's something wrong with the line or phone. If someone gives you a bad check, there's no money to back up the check. If you do a bad job on a test, you got a C if you're lucky. In movies, a villain is a bad guy. Also, when someone does something wrong, they might say ""My bad!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0085,"<ul><li>Balance is having the right amount — not too much or too little — of any quality, which leads to harmony or evenness. You might admire the balance someone has achieved between working hard and having fun.</li><li>The noun form of balance can also describe finances: If you're making monthly payments on a loan, the total amount you still owe is the balance. Balance is also the physical steadiness that keeps you on your feet. You balance your weight between both sides of your body. Balance has a verb form that has several shades of meaning, typically involving one thing correctly weighed against another, like when you balance your budget.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0086,"<ul><li>A bike is a pedal-powered two-wheeled vehicle. If you don't have time to walk to work, you might decide to ride your bike instead.</li><li>Bike is shorthand for a bicycle or a motorbike. A bike enthusiast might keep a bike rack on her car and a bike helmet in her trunk at all times. Bike is also a verb, so you could say: ""I'll bike over to the movie theater — meet you there in fifteen minutes!"" This word, as a nickname for bicycle, first appeared in American English in 1882. It came to mean ""motorcycle"" about 50 years later.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0087,"<ul><li>The hardest part of adopting a dog from a shelter is when you have to choose which one to bring home with you. When you pick out one pup from the mass of barking canines, that's the dog you choose.</li><li>Any time you decide on one thing over another — whether it's a seat on a plane, a new pair of shoes, or who you want to marry — you choose it. The Old English word that choose comes from is ceosan, which means something closer to ""taste.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0088,"<ul><li>You see doctor, and you think of someone doing good — like the medical doctor who saves lives. However, a person who doctors or tampers with a document is adding something wrong or harmful to it, like a lie.</li><li>Doctor is the Latin word for ""teacher,"" which makes sense since your doctor is often the one teaching you about how to take care of your body. Anyone who has a PhD, be it in English or Egyptology, is also referred to as a doctor because she holds a doctorate degree. But beware, there's also a market out there for doctored, or tampered-with diplomas, where you can buy a fake degree to call yourself a doctor.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B01_U05_0090,"<ul><li>Football is a sport. American football is played with an oval ball and the football players tackle each other. In the rest of the world, football is actually soccer. A football also refers to the ball itself.</li><li>Football is a game in which players, wearing helmets and protective padding, run while holding the ball and pass by throwing it to teammates, and occasionally try to kick the ball through the goalposts. Players also smash into each other, hence the helmets and padding. Soccer, also known as football, involves players kicking the ball with their feet — only the goalkeeper can touch it with her hands. In both sports, at some point a foot hits the ball.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0091,"<ul><li>When you are having fun, you are having a good time. Watching little kids jump around inside an inflatable bouncy house, you can instantly tell how much fun they're having.</li><li>There is no mistaking fun when you're having it, and it's generally used to mean exactly what it sounds like, some activity or experience that's purely enjoyable. When fun takes the form of an adjective, it's informal, not strictly grammatically correct. So while you can say, ""Being with her is so much fun,"" you can't correctly say, ""She is such a fun girl."" Fun turns a little bit mean when you're making fun of, or teasing, your friend. In this case, it might be fun for you, but it's probably not very much fun for him.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0092,"<ul><li>A game is a contest or pastime. Football, checkers, Monopoly, volleyball, Ms. Pacman —  they're all fun games to play.</li><li>Some games are simple, like Connect Four or Tic Tac Toe. Others are played for millions of dollars, like professional basketball. Games usually have winners and losers, and people play them because they're fun. Other meanings of this word have less to do with playing: If you're a salesperson, you could say you're in the sales game. Wild animals that you hunt and eat are called game. And being game can mean you have disabled feet or legs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0093,"<ul><li>As the heart is the central organ of the human body, so the word heart has come to mean a central location of an organization or system, as well as being used to describe courage and generosity.</li><li>We can see the Germanic influences in the word heart by looking at the Old Saxon herta and the German herz. If we go back even further, however, we see the word also has ties to the Greek kardia, which makes sense when we consider that the prefix cardio refers to the heart. For example, a cardio workout is one that gets the heart pumping harder, and a cardiologist is a doctor of the heart.  If someone asks that you ""have a heart,"" however, they are appealing to your sense of generosity not to the blood-pumping organ.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0094,"<ul><li>Golf is a game that involves using a club to hit a small ball into a series of cups laid out on a course. If golf seems too difficult, you might try taking up miniature golf — with a short course and whimsical obstacles — instead.</li><li>Scotland is famous for its golf courses, and in fact the game was invented there during the 15th century. Golf comes from the Scottish gouf, an alteration of the Middle Dutch colf, ""bat or club."" The first known printed use of the word golf was in a statute banning the game — King James II believed that archery was more important and that golf was a distraction. Later monarchs enjoyed the game and lifted the ban.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0095,"<ul><li>The noun increase indicates growth of something that gets bigger in number or volume. When used as a verb, it means the act of growing or gaining more. However it's used, it refers to something that has gotten bigger.</li><li>Anything that can add on can increase. You can increase your speed to go faster, increase your strength by working out, increase your knowledge by studying, and increase your circle of friends by meeting more people. You can work harder to see an increase of profits, and you can prevent an increase in your electric bill by turning out unnecessary lights.

4000EEW_B01_U05_0096,"<ul><li>Plants, animals, insects, bacteria, viruses, algae, mold and humans all have life: they grow, eat, make waste, change, and reproduce. Rocks and minerals, not doing any of these, do not have life.</li><li>Your life is the time from your birth to your death — you can see this in its origins: ""to remain, persevere, continue, live."" Life is everything that happens: When people say, ""That's life,"" they mean all the events and tendencies, the human condition itself. You might hear about ""city life"" — or ""country life"" for that matter — meaning the habits and expectations of inhabitants of a particular place.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0097,"<ul><li>A kilometer is a unit of metric measurement that's about 2/3 as long as a mile. If you sign up for a five kilometer race, you'll be running a course that's a little over three miles long.</li><li>Most countries around the world measure geographical distance using kilometers rather than miles — the exceptions are the U.S. and the U.K. The word means ""one thousand meters,"" from Greek roots khilioi, ""thousand,"" and metron, ""measure."" As you might guess, there are a thousand meters in a single kilometer. If you drive from the U.S. across the Canadian border, expect to see speed limit signs change from miles per hour to kilometers per hour.</li></ul>"

Often can also mean ""in many cases or instances."" When a student starts to study more and get more serious about learning, it often leads to better grades.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0099,"<ul><li>If you've eaten your fill at a big meal, you know by your full stomach that you have had plenty. In fact, if you had more than plenty, you might even get the feeling you've had too much!</li><li>The word plenty usually refers to more than just enough, and this comes, via Middle French plenté, from the Latin word plēnitās, ""fullness,"" from plenus, ""full, complete."" The meaning is apparent in the following quote by English novelist George Eliot: ""I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music."" May you have plenty of what you need, and some of what you want as well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U05_0100,"<ul><li>The weight of a cat on your lap might not bother you, but the weight of your 156 pound Rottweiler?  Oh boy. Weight refers to the heaviness of a person or object.</li><li>In physics, weight is a precise measurement based on the force that gravity exerts on a mass. Got that?  All meanings of the word weight are related to this sense of heaviness.  Something that is important, like testimony at a trial or a serious conversation, can be described as having weight, even if you can't put it on a scale.</li></ul>"

If you are in Hawaii for the summer and your best friend is in Maine, you are apart.</li><li>You can say that San Diego and San Francisco are about 500 miles apart, or that you hate spending time apart from your cat when you travel. Sometimes people are figuratively apart, when they've ended their relationship. You can also use apart to mean ""in pieces,"" as when a firecracker blows apart an apple. The word comes from the Old French à part, ""to the side,"" from the Latin roots ad ""to,"" and partem, ""a side.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0102,"<ul><li>An attribute is a quality or characteristic given to a person, group, or some other thing. Your best attribute might be your willingness to help others, like when you stopped traffic so the duck family could cross the street.</li><li>Attribute comes from the Latin verb attribuere, which is made up the prefix ad, meaning ""to,"" and tribuere meaning ""give or bestow."" As a verb, to attribute is to give credit, like if you attribute the A on your test to all that hard studying. In Greek and Roman mythology an attribute will often stand in for a character such as Zeus's lightning bolt or Poseidon's trident.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0103,"<ul><li>Bilingual is an adjective that describes a person or community that speaks two languages.  A bilingual woman might speak Spanish and English, and a part of town where people speak Mandarin and Polish is a bilingual neighborhood.</li><li>The prefix bi- means “having two,” and the Latin word lingua means “tongue, language,” so bilingual literally means “having two tongues.”  It would be a mouthful to have two physical tongues, but luckily bilingual is for language tongues: the ability to speak two languages fluently.   Bilingual is also a noun, and a person can be called a bilingual, like in the African country Chad, where the official languages are French and Arabic, and where many of the citizens are bilinguals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0104,"<ul><li>Use completely to describe something that is totally and utterly...something. A completely ridiculous idea is absolutely crazy and stupid.</li><li>Completely is an adverb that comes from the Latin completus, ""to fill up."" We use it to mean ""entirely"" or ""wholly."" So if a building is completely destroyed, no part of it is left standing. Reading a newspaper story or watching a documentary film completely means you finished it from beginning to end. And doing so can completely change your view on an issue.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0105,"<ul><li>When you dash, you run a short distance very quickly. If you forget your lunch in the morning, you might try to dash home, grab it, and dash back to school.</li><li>This word can be used in many ways. When your dog chases your cat, they dash around the house — and you can call this sprint itself a dash. When you use the punctuation mark known as a dash, you write a horizontal line ( — ) to mark a pause, a change, or an omitted word. As a verb, dash can also mean to destroy, as when unusually warm weather dashes your hopes of a snowy holiday, or to smash, as when you dash a coconut against a rock to break it open.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0106,"<ul><li>Disgust is a strong feeling of dislike. If you can't stand peas, you might wrinkle your nose in disgust when you are served a bowl of pea soup.</li><li>Disgust is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it's a reaction to something you think is gross or terrible, like showing your disgust at a movie by getting up and leaving. As a verb, disgust means ""to offend,"" like when your class's bad behavior at the assembly disgusts all the teachers, or ""to gross out or revolt."" If you pick your nose in public, you will disgust everyone around you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0107,"<ul><li>Something that's fashionable is in style. Your cousin might insist that wearing wide-brimmed fishing hats is very fashionable right now.</li><li>Things that are very trendy or popular are fashionable, whether they're a brand of jeans or a particular baked good that everyone seems to be eating. A person who follows these trends can also be described as fashionable: 
""Did you see John walk by wearing those yellow boots and eating a huge doughnut? He's so fashionable."" The noun fashion is at the root of fashionable, with its Old French origin, façon, ""face, appearance, design, or beauty.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0108,"<ul><li>If it has to do with other countries or their people, it is foreign, like a French movie receiving a British award for Best Foreign Film.</li><li>The adjective foreign is based on the Latin word foris, meaning “outside.” A foreign exchange student goes outside of his or her country to study. When you learn a foreign language, it is outside of the one you first learned. If you sleep late on the weekends, someone might say, ""Getting up early on Saturdays is a foreign concept to you."" This means it's outside of your experience and knowledge.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0109,"<ul><li>Deep, wide and often filled with water, a gulf is any vast and seemingly unbridgeable area.</li><li>You've probably heard of the Gulf of Mexico, that large body of water that's partly surrounded by land. But a gulf doesn't have to be all about the ocean. If two people have vastly different cultures or opinions, you could say that there's a gulf between them — a large divide that neither side is willing or able to cross.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0110,"<ul><li>A mirror is a glass surface backed with a metallic coating that reflects images that are in front of it. When you gaze at yourself in a mirror, your own face gazes right back at you.</li><li>""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?"" asks the evil queen in ""Snow White,"" as she admires her reflection. Ordinary mirrors can't answer this question, but they can show you how you look in your new hat or whether you have spinach between your teeth. And the verb mirror means ""reflect,"" as when the surface of a lake mirrors the sky.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0111,"<ul><li>Natural describes something that comes from nature, rather than being man-made. Your healthy friend who only eats natural food will probably choose carrots instead of potato chips for a snack.</li><li>The adjective natural is a common word with a lot of meanings. It describes anything that comes from nature, but it also means ""inborn"" when you describe your basketball-star friend as a natural athlete. You can also use it to talk about someone being at ease  (""he tried to act natural when the police passed by"") or to mean ""inevitable,"" as when you say, ""It's only natural that those two ended up getting married.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0112,
4000EEW_B01_U06_0113,"<ul><li>A participant is a person who participates, or takes part in something. Vote on Election Day and you've just taken part in or become a participant in United States democracy.</li><li>Participants play a role in the unfolding of events. A contestant is a participant on a game show. A football player is a participant in the sport. Someone talking is a participant in a conversation. You can sometimes be a participant without taking an active role — if you watch a crime taking place and do nothing to stop it, you might be called a passive participant.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0114,"<ul><li>A ritual is a ceremony or action performed in a customary way. Your family might have a Saturday night ritual of eating a big spaghetti dinner and then taking a long walk to the ice cream shop.</li><li>As an adjective, ritual means ""conforming to religious rites,"" which are the sacred, customary ways of celebrating a religion or culture. Different communities have different ritual practices, like meditation in Buddhism, or baptism in Christianity. We also call the ceremony itself a ritual. Although it comes from religious ceremonies, ritual can also be used for any time-honored tradition, like the Superbowl, or Mardi Gras, or Sunday morning pancake breakfast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0115,"<ul><li>Anything that's spoken is said out loud. ""Spoken word"" is a genre of poetry that is meant to be recited and performed in front of an audience.</li><li>Spoken is the past participle of the verb speak, but it's also an adjective that describes things that are uttered or said or articulated or voiced. It's often used in combination with another adjective, like a soft-spoken friend or a blunt-spoken teacher. It can also distinguish one thing from a written version: ""I'm taking a spoken exam instead of a written one, so I should do fine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0116,"<ul><li>Sport has many definitions, the most familiar of which is a game involving physical exertion — think tennis or hockey. Randomly, sport can also mean to wear, as in, ""he looked sharp sporting a yellow sport coat.""</li><li>Most of the definitions of sport involve the idea of fun, or of something being fair. Hopefully organized sports are both. A sporting chance means a player in a game has a fair chance of winning. A good sport is someone who plays fair, and wins and loses graciously. If you torture flies for sport, you do it for fun, and that's just wrong. If you make sport of your little sister's stutter, you make fun of it, and that's even worse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0117,"<ul><li>If you are taken unawares by something unexpected, you can describe that feeling with the adjective surprised. Look surprised when your friends plan a party without telling you, even if you see the cars in the driveway and know what's going on.</li><li>Surprised originally meant attacked unexpectedly. It was from the Old French surprendre meaning to overtake, with the root prendere from the Latin word for seize. Surprised has synonyms in words like astonished, amazed, and flabbergasted, but the latter three convey a greater sense of shock or bewilderment. You are surprised by the party, amazed that your old friend came, and flabbergasted to learn she is actually your sister.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U06_0118,"<ul><li>When something's stretched tight, it's tense. A rope can be tense. So can a muscle. When a person's tense, they're anxious.</li><li>When a situation is tense, you might say you could ""cut the tension with a knife."" When a muscle tenses up, it contracts suddenly–-a person can be said to tense up also. The opposite of tense is ""relaxed."" If you tense up during exams, it's probably best to learn some relaxation techniques. The brain works best when it's relaxed.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B01_U06_0120,"<ul><li>If your grasp of physics is vague and you've got a test coming up, it's time to hit the books.  When something is vague, it’s unclear, murky, and hard to understand.</li><li>Vague comes from the Latin vagus, which means wandering or rambling. Think of a vagabond, someone who wanders around the world with only a vague idea of where he's going. There are a few big, impressive words for vague, including ambiguous, nebulous, and tenebrous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0121,"<ul><li>If you allow your best friend to read your diary, it means you've given him permission to do it.</li><li>The verb allow means to let someone do something. You can allow casually, like when you allow your friend to bite off a few pieces from your candy necklace, or more officially, as when a city government decides to allow dogs to be brought into restaurants. Allow can also be used to mean ""admit the truth of,"" so you could say, ""Fine, I'll allow that dogs aren't any dirtier than many people, but it's still strange seeing them in restaurants.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0122,"<ul><li>Announce means to make something public. Companies announce the release of new products, parents announce the marriages of their children, and school administrators announce changes to the day's schedule over the PA.</li><li>Announce has some subtler meanings as well—you might inadvertently announce your attention to go for the basket by looking at it during a game. You might very intentionally announce that you are never eating pizza again, if you want everyone you know to be aware of this.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0123,
4000EEW_B01_U07_0124,"<ul><li>A challenge is something that puts you to the test — like running your first marathon or reading War and Peace.</li><li>Challenge, as a verb, is derived from a Latin word meaning ""to accuse falsely,"" and it is still used much as it was in the 13th century, in the sense of questioning whether something is true or right. Students sometimes challenge a weeknight curfew, and lawyers might challenge the evidence submitted by the other side in a lawsuit. Challenge is also used as a noun for a competition in which people challenge one another to prove that they’re the best at something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0125,"<ul><li>When you express your right to something, you're making a claim to it, like telling your sister, ""This bowl of cereal is mine.""</li><li>A claim is when you express your right to something that belongs to you, like your medical records or the deed to your home. When you make a claim or claim something, you're demanding it or saying it’s true. People claim dependents and deductions on their taxes. In court, you could claim you deserve money from an employer who cheated you. You could claim you can juggle chainsaws. With any kind of claim, you're going to have to prove it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0126,"<ul><li>A medical problem or illness can be referred to as a condition. Your skin condition isn't contagious, but it still looks bad — scabby and scaly. You won't even need makeup to dress as a zombie for Halloween.</li><li>A condition is also a requirement or prerequisite for something. As a condition of your acceptance to college, you may have to maintain certain grades and do well on a standardized test. Condition can refer as well to the state or quality of something. The condition of your apartment building might be so appalling that your mail carrier has stopped delivering your mail.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0127,"<ul><li>To contribute something is to provide a part of the whole. When your company has their annual softball game and potluck picnic, you will probably be asked to contribute a dish, like your famous macaroni salad.</li><li>Contribute comes from a Latin word that means “to bring together, add, or unite.”  When you contribute to a cause, you are adding to what other people have kicked in, which makes the effort complete.  You can contribute your singing talent to a traveling a cappella group; you can contribute money or time to save rhinoceroses; you can contribute cupcakes to the gymnastics team bake sale; or you can even contribute ideas on healthcare reform to a Washington think tank.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0128,"<ul><li>Difference is a word for things that are not the same. Identical twins have few if any differences in appearance.</li><li>If you dye your hair green, everyone is going to notice a huge difference. People often have differences of opinion. No two people are alike, so there are all kinds of differences between individuals. In math, a difference is the remainder left after subtracting one number from another. Chimps and gorillas are both apes, but there are a lot of differences between them. If something doesn't really change an outcome, you can say, ""It makes no difference.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0129,"<ul><li>When you divide something, you separate it into different parts. A pizza maker may divide a ball of dough into two parts to make two pies, or you might even divide a stick of gum in half to share it with a friend.</li><li>The verb divide can refer to the splitting apart of anything, whether it’s pizza dough, gum, time, a country, or a political group. Math types probably already know that the word also can refer to a mathematical function involving figuring out how many times a certain number contains another number. As a noun, divide means a hostile split between two groups, such as a growing divide between conservative and liberal groups.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0130,"<ul><li>An expert is someone who knows a ton about the subject at hand. The adjective form of expert describes someone or something that has that special knowledge. If you get expert instruction, that means an expert is your teacher.</li><li>The word expert is related to experience, and to be an expert at something you need experience. While your academic honors might suggest that you're an expert in certain areas, like rocket science, other fields — like wake boarding and tattoo art, for example — require more hands-on experience before you're an expert. The word expert is also an adjective: once you become really good at it, people will say you're an expert snake handler.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0131,"<ul><li>Something famous is well known, usually because it's special or particularly good. Celebrities, historic paintings, and the best burger in town could all be described as famous.</li><li>If something is famous, then a lot of people know about it. If you turn on the television or look at a magazine rack, you'll see plenty of famous people: movie stars, TV stars, musicians, athletes, and politicians are all famous. Lots of people want to be famous, but there are good and bad parts to it. It must be nice to be rich, but being constantly surrounded by fans and photographers can't be fun.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0132,"<ul><li>Force describes a physical energy that can be seen or felt. If you've ever walked outside in a blizzard, you've experienced the force, or strength, of the wind. May the force be with you!</li><li>Force has other meanings as well. A powerful person can exert a force just by using particular words or body language. Written words can exert a force, or have a strong influence, on your opinion. As a verb, force means to make something happen using physical strength or some other powerful effort, which is what you do when you try to force a square peg into a round hole through vigorous pounding. And of course, in the Star Wars movie franchise, the force refers to the mystical energy contained in all living things. May that definition of this word always be with you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0133,"<ul><li>Harm is a deliberate injury or damage to someone or something. A playground bully is a mean kid who causes harm to other kids.</li><li>Harm is both a noun and a verb — when you inflict harm on your brother, you harm him. Physically hurting someone is only one way to harm them. If a classmate spreads a mean rumor about you, that also harms you. The Old English root word is hearm, which means ""hurt"" and ""pain,"" but also ""evil"" and ""insult.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0134,"<ul><li>To lay is to set something down or put it in a horizontal position. It can also mean to position or prepare something for action — or simply to lay eggs.</li><li>The word lay can mean a lot of different things, but one of its most common uses is as the adjective component of layperson, which refers to someone who is not a member of the clergy or is not a member of a particular profession and so cannot always understand that profession's technical jargon. This is why we sometimes request things to be communicated in ""lay language,"" meaning simple, everyday terms that a layperson can understand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0135,"<ul><li>Peace is a stress-free state of security and calmness that comes when there’s no fighting or war, everything coexisting in perfect harmony and freedom.</li><li>In our war-torn world, it seems like there’s not nearly enough peace.  However peace can be big and small, seen in entire countries or brief moments.  After a war, two countries may sign a peace treaty, agreeing to not fight anymore.  Sweden has avoided war since 1814, and enjoys the peace that the lack of conflict brings. When you feel at peace with yourself, you are content to be the person you are, flaws and everything.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0136,"<ul><li>A prince is royalty, the son of a king or queen. Originally, a prince was the ruler of and individual territory, also known as “principalities.” A prince is a popular fairy tale hero, but there are real live ones, too.</li><li>A prince is the son of a monarch, possibly even the person who stands to inherit the title of king after his father's death. Sometimes, though, a prince is simply a member of the royal family, or even a ruler over a small area of the monarch's country. Prince comes from the Latin princeps, ""first man"" or ""ruler,"" from primus, ""first."" A prince is often first in line to inherit the throne.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0137,"<ul><li>Whether it’s your reputation or your jewelry, when you protect something you keep it safe from anything that might threaten or harm it.</li><li>The word protect came into English by way of the Latin verb protegere, a combination of pro- meaning “in front,” and tegere, meaning “to cover.” When you protect something, in a way you’re covering it or shielding it from harm. Often the word is used in the sense of protecting something, like a valued item or a person, but you can also protect against something. For example, you might get a flu shot to protect against the flu virus.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0138,"<ul><li>When you sense something, you know it intuitively, like when you can tell your mother is angry not by her words but by the tone of her voice.</li><li>Sense has many shades of meaning, all involving understanding or becoming aware of something. You can use sense to describe something perceived with your senses, like when you sense your dog is near because of the smell. Sense also refers to the unconscious process of figuring something out, like when you sense that someone is cheating at cards. If you have common sense you don't do foolish things. The sense of a word is how it's used.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0139,"<ul><li>Anything sudden is abrupt, quick, or unexpected. A sudden rain shower during your picnic is disappointing, while a sudden drop-off in the road ahead can be dangerous if you're on your skateboard.</li><li>The stock market might take a sudden dive, panicking investors, or your favorite TV show could make a sudden change in plot, confusing you for a couple of episodes. Sudden has been used as an adjective since the 15th century, and it was once a noun, too, meaning ""that which is sudden."" Today the noun form is obsolete, except in the phrase ""all of a sudden.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U07_0140,"<ul><li>The adverb therefore means as a result or consequence, or ""for that reason."" Cats and dogs tend to fight; therefore, keep your pets apart at night if you want to get some sleep.</li><li>The adverb therefore is also used to introduce a conclusion that follows based on logic. You'll see this construction a lot in logic, math, and science, for example. Of course, sometimes the conclusions are false, as in this argument: ""All fish live in water. A whale lives in water. Therefore, a whale is a fish."" A whale is, in fact, a mammal. Therefore, the argument that a whale is a fish is wrong.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0141,"<ul><li>Please accept (""favorably receive"") our apologies, but you're just going to have to accept (""put up with"") the fact that this verb has almost a dozen different meanings.</li><li>You might accept (""take"") bribes from people who dislike multiple meanings, or they might challenge you to a duel, which you might accept (""consent to""). When historians record your story, you might accept (""officially receive"") their books and accept (""hold as true"") the most flattering one. When you apply to cool-people clubs, they'll accept (""admit"") you, and when you go broke, they'll accept (""take on"") your debt, until the day your coffin accepts (""takes"") your weary accepting bones.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0142,"<ul><li>Think it might be fun to be a party planner? These highly organized people arrange everything from invitations to music, food, even the lighting in the room, meaning they put everything in order.</li><li>At a concert, you look in your program to see what piece is next. There's a title, followed by the composer's name. Under that is another name, preceded by ""arranged by."" What does that mean? Every piece was originally written with a certain instrument or instruments in mind. In order for that music to be played by other instruments, it first has to be adapted, meaning someone has to arrange it. A symphony for kazoos? You can arrange that.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0143,"<ul><li>The verb attend means to be present, to listen, or give care or attention to. You can attend your family reunion, attend to a project you've been ignoring, or attend to your teacher's voice.</li><li>When you use attend as ""pay attention"" or ""take care of,"" it's followed by ""to."" When you use attend as in ""attend a party,"" you don't. If you attend a political rally, you'll want to attend to what the politicians have to say. When you take attendance, you are checking which students have chosen to attend class, i.e. who is in attendance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0144,"<ul><li>To chase is to follow or go after someone or something you want. This activity is called a chase. Dogs chase cats, cats chase mice, and mice are in big trouble.</li><li>The word chase tried to run away from the Old French word chacier for ""to hunt or strive for,” but we caught it. Any time you’re trying to get something that’s trying to get away from you, you chase it. Police officers chase criminals, and kids playing tag chase each other all over the yard. You can also chase things that aren't physical, like a dream or a goal. This activity itself is called a chase.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0145,"<ul><li>The verb contrast means to show a difference, like photos that reveal how much weight someone lost by contrasting the ""before"" and ""after"" shots.</li><li>You probably know contrast in its relation to compare. To contrast something is to look for differences among two or more elements, but compare is to do the opposite, to look for similarities. It's easy to tell the difference if you remember that contrast comes from the Latin root contra, and means ""against."" Contrast is also a noun meaning basically the same thing — you might notice the contrast of a dark tree against a snow-covered hill.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0146,"<ul><li>When you encourage someone, you give him or her the courage or confidence to do something, like when you encourage your little brother to play harder by yelling his name from the sidelines of the soccer field.</li><li>The word encourage comes from the Old French word encoragier, meaning ""make strong, hearten."" When you encourage the tomato plants in your garden, you water them to promote their growth and health. Encourage can also mean to inspire with hope, like when you encourage your friends to try out for the school play by complimenting their singing and acting talents.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0147,"<ul><li>When something is so commonplace you know it well, it's familiar. A familiar song might be one that you hum along to without even thinking about it.</li><li>Like family, anything or anyone you're familiar with has been in your life for a while. It can be used in many ways. After six years of Spanish, you'll be familiar with how to conjugate verbs. You and your close friends are on familiar terms. The smell of musty tent fabric is familiar to anyone who grew up going camping a lot, and may bring on a wave of nostalgia.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0148,"<ul><li>When you grab something, you clutch at it. When a party-goer breaks open a piñata, the other guests usually grab wildly at the candy that cascades out of it.</li><li>You can grab for the string of a balloon as it floats away, or grab your friend in a hug. Another way to grab is to make an impression: ""When I hear a marching band, it grabs my attention."" A ""grab bag"" is a random mixture of things, or a bag of goodies you can reach into and grab from. If something's ""up for grabs."" it's available: ""This last piece of pie is up for grabs!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0149,"<ul><li>When you hang something, you dangle or suspend it. You can hang a piñata from a tree, hang a picture on the wall, or hang a wind chime on your porch.</li><li>People hang all kinds of things: washing on a clothesline, a rope swing over a lake, or a shower curtain in the bathroom. An artist also hangs an art show — meaning she installs it in a gallery or museum, and maybe literally hangs paintings on the wall. If your mouth hangs open, it gapes, and when fog hangs in the air, it rests there, suspended. Informally, you can ""get the hang"" of something, or figure it out through practice.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0150,"<ul><li>Use the adjective huge to describe something that’s really, really big. When your friend throws a huge birthday party and invites everyone she knows, you can finally talk to that cute neighbor you have a huge crush on.</li><li>Huge is a relative word — there’s no specific degree or size something has to reach before you can say it’s huge. You can eat a huge piece of cake, or go see huge elephants in the zoo. Cake and elephants are both concrete things, but huge can also describe things that aren’t actual objects. For example, you can make a huge difference by volunteering at an animal shelter.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0151,"<ul><li>Everyone can agree that certain things are necessary for survival: food, water, shelter. Some people might add chocolate to that list. Necessary refers to anything you can't do without.</li><li>Necessary, cede, and cease all come from the same root, cedere, which is Latin for ""to go away"" or ""to give something up.""  When something's necessary, you won't give it up. That fudge-covered brownie sundae from your favorite ice-cream shop? It might seem like a decadent treat, but if you're a true chocolate lover you'll insist that it's as necessary as a warm jacket in winter.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0152,"<ul><li>Something that repeats in a predictable way is a pattern. You might find a pattern in a series of numbers, in the material covering your couch, or in the habits of your upstairs neighbor.</li><li>The noun pattern could refer to a design or to customary behavior. Your patterns of behavior might include your morning cup of coffee and exercise. The word pattern can also be used as a verb form meaning ""to model."" For example, your art might be patterned after the artwork of a famous artist.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0153,"<ul><li>The verb propose means ""to suggest a plan,"" like the most well-known thing to propose: marriage. If you propose to your girlfriend, you propose getting married, and you probably give her a ring, too.</li><li>The word propose comes from the Old French root words pro, meaning ""forth"" and poser, meaning ""put, place."" Using propose to refer to an offer of marriage was first recorded in the 1700s but the verb also has other meanings. It can mean to present for consideration or criticism, like proposing a four-day school week or ""to nominate someone for an elected office or official post.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0154,"<ul><li>When you do something with purpose, you do it with determination. When your activities have a purpose, you have an aim or intention in mind.</li><li>This noun also has a third meaning: ""function, role, or use."" The purpose of a fork, for instance, is to spear and scoop food from your plate, not to poke your little brother at the dinner table. Purpose can also be used as a verb meaning ""to reach a decision"" or ""to intend,"" though these uses of the word are quite a bit less frequent nowadays.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0155,"<ul><li>To release something or someone is to set it free, like a caged animal or a prisoner.  “I shall be released” is a famous refrain from a 1967 Bob Dylan song that has come to symbolize political freedom around the world.</li><li>Release, which is a noun and a verb, has many different meanings.  As a noun, it can mean a liberation, an unfastening, or the condition of being made available, like a movie or a CD.  “When is the new Spiderman movie being released?” you might ask your best friend.  As a verb, it can mean to relieve of suffering or obligation, like a debt.  But it can also mean to lay off from a job, or surrender.  “Release me from having to watch this terrible movie!” you could end up saying about the 16th Spiderman sequel.  And who would blame you?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0156,"<ul><li>Require means to need. You require food, water, and shelter to live, but do you really require that new pair of high-fashion shoes?</li><li>The verb require comes from Latin root words re-, meaning ""repeatedly,"" and quaerere, meaning ""to ask."" The word lost the sense of asking and came to mean needing, demanding, or insisting upon something. The law requires that you attend school until you're sixteen; your parents probably require you to finish high school. If you're a waiter in a fancy restaurant and the food has been served, you might ask if your customers require anything else.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0157,"<ul><li>If you’re satisfied, you’re contented, and you don’t need anything more. You're not overjoyed, but you're not complaining either.</li><li>When something is satisfied, the requirements have been met and nothing more needs to be done. When you pay back the money you owe on a loan, you have satisfied the debt. If you just had a delicious meal, your hunger is probably satisfied. If you’re an outlaw cowboy and your partner double crosses you, you won’t be satisfied until you’ve run him out of town.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0158,"<ul><li>If something is totally alone, or consists of only one part, it's single, like a single sock in your clean laundry basket that's mysteriously lost its mate.</li><li>Maybe there's a single house on a street, or a single red rose in a bouquet. People can be single too, if they aren't attached romantically to another person: ""She had a terrible boyfriend, but now she's single."" Single can also mean ""distinct,"" or separate from everything else, like when you read every single word of a book to prepare for a test at school. And if you ""single someone out,"" you place the focus on that one person.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0159,"<ul><li>When you tear something, you rip it apart. You might tear a hole in your jeans if you catch them on something sharp, or you might tear up that love letter you wrote to your crush.</li><li>The verb tear often refers to pulling something apart or making a hole — and has a noun form that describes the result of those actions — but it can also describe quick movement. If you tear out of the parking lot, you’re driving very fast. When you use tear in these ways, pronounce it to rhyme with hair. Another word, tear — what you do or produce when you cry — is spelled the same but pronounced to rhyme with peer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U08_0160,"<ul><li>When you have a theory, you have a set of beliefs or principles that might not be proven yet. Does anyone have a good theory for where missing socks go when you do laundry?</li><li>A theory is a set of accepted beliefs or organized principles that explain and guide analysis and one of the ways that theory is defined is that it is different from practice, when certain principles are tested. For example, you could be a musician who plays well but who doesn't have a lot of experience with the theory of music. This word is a noun and comes from the Greek theoria, which means ""contemplation or speculation.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0161,"<ul><li>An animal is a particular kind of living organism, one that can move voluntarily and can find and digest food. Your favorite animal might be the naked mole rat, but probably not.</li><li>Although a human is biologically an animal, the word often distinguishes humans from other kinds of animals, like when scientists talk about diseases passing from animals to people. Sometimes the word animal means a cruel, violent, or uncivilized person: ""He just destroyed my house at the party last night — what an animal!"" The Latin word for ""soul,"" anima, led to animale, or ""living being, a being that breathes."" Before 1500, the word ""beast"" was much more commonly used than animal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0162,"<ul><li>A bus is a long vehicle with many seats. An elementary school student might save a seat on the school bus each morning for her best friend.</li><li>A city bus carries far more passengers than a private car, which makes it an efficient form of transportation. When bus is used as a verb, it means to transport by bus, sometimes in an effort to desegregate a school district: ""The city will bus students from this neighborhood to the other side of town."" It also means ""to clear a table"" in restaurant lingo, which is often done by a ""bus boy"" or a ""busser.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0163,
4000EEW_B01_U09_0164,"<ul><li>A command  is an order that you have to follow, as long as the person who gives it has authority over you. You don't have to comply with your friend's command that you give him all your money.</li><li>Command, which can be a noun or a verb, combines the Latin prefix com-, meaning ""with,"" and mandāre, ""to charge, enjoin,"" so to give someone a command is to say something with the authority that charges him to follow it. Your mother might command you to clean your room. Command can also mean a position of power, like having command of a battleship, or possession of a skill, like having a great command of video games.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0165,"<ul><li>To depend is to have confidence in something or someone. You can depend on your most loyal friend to show up for your modern dance performance in the park (although you probably can't depend on her liking it).</li><li>Depend can also mean ""determined by or contingent on something else."" For example, if rain is in the forecast, your outdoor dance performance may be cancelled; it depends on the weather. Depend is almost always followed by the word on or upon, with upon being more formal. If you're speaking informally, you may drop the on or upon, as in ""It all depends how you feel."" Your decision to do that will, of course, depend upon your audience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0166,"<ul><li>A dog is a member of the Canine genus, sometimes found wild but often found curled up on the couch when you're not at home.</li><li>A dog is an animal of the genus Canis, probably descended from wolves, but in some cases more like teddy bears. Animal names are really old words, and dog is old enough that no one knows where it's from. We also call ugly ladies and rotten gentlemen ""dogs,"" so be careful not to call someone ""a dog"" when you mean, ""what up, dog."" It's also a verb: to dog (or to hound) someone is to follow them around relentlessly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0167,"<ul><li>A door is a moving structure that when closed acts as a barrier to a room, house, building, or car. You'll have to open the door to let your dog come inside.</li><li>Buildings have doors, and so do most vehicles. You might also have a special little door built into your own back door for your cat. Doors act as security, as they can be closed and locked, and also as ventilation when you open the door to let the spring air in. Being ""out of doors"" means you're outside, beyond all the doors of your house or building.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0168,"<ul><li>A friend is your buddy, your pal, your amigo, your comrade. You know, someone you trust and like enough to hang out with on a regular basis.</li><li>The noun friend comes to us from the Old English word freond. Back then you had to be careful to not confuse freond with feond, which meant “fiend or enemy.” These days it's pretty tough to get mixed up though. Friends are the people you can count on, the ones that make you laugh and throw you birthday parties. Enemies are generally the mean ones.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0169,"<ul><li>When you hear, you perceive a noise made by someone or something — like a person’s voice, the song of a bird, or the torturous sound of a ticking clock on a sleepless night.</li><li>While hear generally means to perceive a noise, it has several senses, including to listen carefully, as to a story. If you hear from someone, they have contacted you in some way, such as by phone call, email, or even snail mail. A judge will also hear a case when she presides over a trial. And when you hear the news, you’ve gotten information or found something out. But you didn’t hear it from me.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0170,"<ul><li>The verb help means to give aid or assistance to. You can help your friend organize a car wash at school by making posters and putting them up all over town.</li><li>Help can also mean to serve food or drink––as in, ""Help yourself!"" But don't serve yourself too much or there won't be enough for a second helping. One last meaning for help is the people hired to provide domestic services in a home. A nanny, a housekeeper, a gardener are often referred to somewhat derisively as ""the help,"" because their job is helping the family.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0171,"<ul><li>A horse is a large, four-legged animal with hooves, a long nose and tail, and a mane of hair along its upper back. Part of learning how to ride a horse includes giving commands and using the reins to guide it.</li><li>Horses are very strong and fast, which is why humans have domesticated them for thousands of years — horses can be helpful on farms, for riding, and for pulling wagons and carts. Some people ride horses simply as a hobby, while others race them in competitions. Horses are one of the very few animals that can sleep either lying down or standing up, a trait that helped them run quickly from predators in the wild.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0172,"<ul><li>A hospital is the place to go when you're very sick or injured in a way that requires immediate treatment. If you trip over your shoelaces and break your arm, you'll need to go to the hospital.</li><li>People having surgery or delivering a baby usually go to a hospital, and if you suspect you have food poisoning, you might visit the emergency room of a hospital. Hospitals are staffed by doctors and nurses, as well as office workers, cleaners, and aides of various kinds. The earliest hospitals were shelters or needy people, or hostels for travelers, and the word comes from the Late Latin hospitale, ""guest house or inn.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0173,"<ul><li>A leg is the part of a person's body that they use to walk around. All legs, including those of humans and tables alike, are meant to support.</li><li>Your leg is the appendage that stretches from your hip to your ankle, bending handily at the knee so you can run, walk, jump, sit, and skip. You probably also use the word leg to refer to one side of your pants; a support holding a table up; and one separate section of a long trip: ""I'm stopping for coffee on the next leg of my journey."" Leg probably comes from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning ""to bend.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0174,"<ul><li>Medical can describe the practice of medicine, or a type of illness or injury. If bright red spots have erupted all over your arms, you probably have some sort of medical condition, and it would be wise for you to visit a doctor.</li><li>Medical comes from the Latin word mederi, meaning ""to heal,"" which is exactly what medical professionals such as doctors and nurses are trained to do. When you arrive at your doctor's office or local emergency room complaining of various medical conditions ranging from strep throat to a sprained wrist, doctors provide the necessary medical care.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0175,"<ul><li>Something that's open allows you to move or see through it, like an open window or an open gate.</li><li>The adjective open describes something that's not closed or blocked up, like open curtains that provide a view of the garden outside. Open can also refer to something that's unfastened or parted — an open jar of peanut butter, an open eye, or an open book. Things that are vulnerable, straightforward, or uncovered are also open, and if you are open to suggestions, it means you are willing to consider new ideas.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0176,"<ul><li>To pull is to use force to drag or yank something toward you. You might pull a rolling suitcase as you run to catch your train, for example.</li><li>A horse pulls a carriage, and a tow truck pulls your dead car along the highway. You can also pull the cord on the bus that signals the driver to stop, and the kid next to you might pull on your jacket to ask if he can take your seat. A magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat by grasping it and lifting, and a sad story pulls at your heart (figuratively) — it exerts a force on your emotions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0177,
4000EEW_B01_U09_0178,"<ul><li>School is the place you go to learn, and the place you escape from when you play hooky. When you school someone, it means you’ve educated or put that person in his or her place.</li><li>School has its roots in the Greek skhole. That word originally had the sense of “leisure,” which evolved into a “place for discussion,” so you can see how school came to have its modern meaning. School, as in ""school of thought,"" can describe a group of people bonded together by shared principles. The phrase ""school of hard knocks"" is slang for “rough experience in life.” School also refers to a large group of fish that swim together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0179,"<ul><li>See is what your eyes do. However, this word has loads of meanings: you can see a shrink, which means you're consulting a psychiatrist; or you can be seeing your high school sweetheart, which means you're dating him.</li><li>See usually means passively observing, while look, which is also something you do with your eyes, is more active and intentional. When someone says, ""The president will see you now,"" the president is sitting there passively, waiting for you to be shown in. You can say ""I see,"" to mean ""I understand; I get it."" Or you can look into your crystal ball and see into the future, in which case you'd be called a seer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U09_0180,"<ul><li>If you perform duties that help someone else, you're providing a service. If you make dinner for your neighbor's children while she's in the hospital, you're doing a good service.</li><li>Service has many uses, all having to do with serving someone, or doing something for them. In a restaurant the waiter provides service, and if you do something nice for someone, you've done him a good service. If you're in someone's service that means you work for her. Service can also mean a verb meaning ""to fix,"" like when the maintenance whiz services the photocopier, or the mechanic services your car. In church, a ceremony is also called a service.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0181,"<ul><li>A benefit is something that helps you, whether in the form of health insurance provided by an employer, welfare given by the government to those in need, or the benefit of the doubt extended to you by a friend.</li><li>The Latin bene- ""good"" is at the heart of the word benefit, which derives from the Latin benefactum ""good deed."" When attendance at a party or an event raises money for a charity, the event is referred to as a benefit in that charity's honor.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0182,"<ul><li>When you're certain, you're sure about something. When you raise your hand to give the answer, you feel certain that you are correct.</li><li>Certain can mean ""definite"" or ""sure to happen,"" like getting wet, a certain outcome of not having an umbrella in a rainstorm. It can also refer to a particular person or thing. You can use it avoid explaining something unnecessarily — you might say, ""There are certain things I want to do when I get home."" To avoid saying someone's name, you can say, ""a certain person,"" as in, ""A certain person left the kitchen a mess.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0183,"<ul><li>A chance is a possibility — but it's not a sure thing. There could be a chance of rain today or a chance you'll be the lead in the school play.</li><li>Chance is sometimes about opportunity, as in getting a chance to try out for the baseball team. Sometimes it's just luck, as in taking a chance on a new car through a raffle at school. You could meet someone by chance, and you could say, ""I chanced upon him at a coffee shop."" Sometimes the word implies danger, as in ""He took a chance when he signed up for skydiving."" In any case, a chance is never a sure thing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0184,"<ul><li>Effect is the result of an action, as in those “cause and effect” papers you might write in English class. Your topic could be how your late-night tuba playing (cause) has driven your roommate insane (effect).</li><li>Another noun use of effect describes an appearance or impression that’s created on purpose, such as the dramatic effect of the bright red walls in your kitchen, or sound effects from your favorite movie. Effect appears less often as a verb, but when it does, it means “produce.” Usually, it’s a noun. It can even refer to your belongings, like when you get kicked out and your former roomie begs you to get all of your personal effects.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0185,"<ul><li>Essential means very basic or necessary. A good frying pan is one of a short list of kitchen essentials every cook must have. To prevent fires, it's essential to turn off appliances before leaving the house.</li><li>The adjective essential is often followed by to or that: It is essential to wash your hands. It is essential that you dry them after. This adjective is from Middle English essencial, from Late Latin essentialis, from Latin essentia ""the basic nature of a thing, its essence"" plus the Latin suffix -alis ""relating to.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B01_U10_0187,"<ul><li>Focus is something that camera lenses and sleepy students are always being asked to do. For cameras, it means finding a point where the subject is clear or ""in focus."" For students, it means paying attention.</li><li>Focus is all about finding a center — of a parabolic curve, of a lens, of a meditative state. In Latin, focus meant 'domestic hearth,' which just goes to show that not much has changed — since kitchens remain the focus of the modern home. Focus can be used as a verb, as in ""I need to focus on my work, so I can play video games later;"" and as a noun, as in ""What is the focus of this essay? I can't tell, since the writer seems to be all over the place.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0188,"<ul><li>In the old ""Schoolhouse Rock"" song, ""Conjunction junction, what's your function?,"" the word function means, ""What does a conjunction do?"" The famous design dictum ""form follows function"" tells us that an object's design should reflect what it does.</li><li>Function is one of those words that gets used a lot and means lots of different things. It means what something does, but also what a person does, whether something or someone is doing what they should, and crazily enough, a big party. ""Your function is to bring the senator coffee at the political function. He cannot function without it.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0189,"<ul><li>That short green stuff all over the front lawn is grass. What could be better than lying in the grass on a summer afternoon, gazing up at puffy clouds in a blue sky?</li><li>The word grass goes back to a root that means ""green."" You're probably familiar with the grass in back yards and city parks. There's also the grass that covers pastures, meant for cows and sheep to graze on, and the grass of grasslands, growing wild on every continent except Antarctica. If you express envy, you may hear the phrase, ""The grass is always greener on the other side."" In other words, somehow other people's lives always seem better.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0190,"<ul><li>A person who protects something is called a guard. You might see a security guard at the mall, a crossing guard on the street outside a school, or a palace guard at Buckingham Palace.</li><li>To guard something is to watch over it or keep it from danger. You should ask someone to guard your backpack when you go to the restroom at the restaurant — or take it with you. The verb guard also means to protect against unintended consequences. To guard against overeating at the party, you could have a light snack before you go, so you aren't as tempted by all the delicious snacks and desserts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0191,"<ul><li>An image is a picture or other representation of a person or thing, or it can be someone's public perception, like a rock star who tries to change his image by dressing like a professor and learning to play chess.</li><li>Image has its roots in the Latin word imitari, meaning ""to copy or imitate"";  images are judged by how realistically they capture the person or thing they show. Images come in various forms — portraits, photographs, paintings, and sculptures. Another kind of image is what we think a public figure like a celebrity is ""really like."" For example, a flat-broke former millionaire who wants to maintain his image as the money-spending life of the party.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0192,"<ul><li>Something immediate is happening now or right away. If you're in immediate danger, you'd better run or call 911.</li><li>Immediate is a word that pretty much means ""now."" If you take immediate action, then there's no delay. If you need immediate assistance, you can't wait for assistance. The related word immediately should be a clue, since it also means ""right now."" If something is happening later, or it happened a long time ago, or you have to wait for it at all, then it's not immediate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0193,"<ul><li>Primary means basically ""first."" When you vote in a primary, that is the first election in a series. When a matter is of primary concern, it means it's of first importance. Primary school is the first you go to (after nursery school, at least).</li><li>There's an interesting alternate system for counting first, second, third, etc. up to tenth. It's primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, and denary. There's also a word for twelfth, duodenary, though that — along with all the words after tertiary — is rarely used.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0194,"<ul><li>When you are proud, you are feeling pride, or satisfaction with yourself. The word proud can also mean too much of this feeling––sometimes saying someone is proud is the same as saying they're arrogant.</li><li>It's also possible to feel proud of someone else. If your best friend gets the lead in the school play, you may find yourself feeling as happy for him as if you'd got the lead yourself. When you graduate from college, your ""proud parents"" will want to be there to watch. The maxim ""Pride comes before a fall"" plays on the fact that when you are proud of what you have, you are also at risk: having something means you have something to lose.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0195,"<ul><li>To remain is to stay in the same place or situation. You can remain at home instead of going out to the movies with your friends, but that doesn't mean you won't remain friends.</li><li>If things remain the same, they don't change, and if your family remains in the same town, they don't move. When something is left behind, it also remains: ""All that remains of my party is a bunch of deflated balloons."" In the fifteenth century, remain was a noun too, meaning ""people or things left over or surviving."" Today we use remainder instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0196,"<ul><li>To rest means to relax into something and let it support you. Rest yourself on the couch for a while, if you're tired.</li><li>The word rest comes from the German rasta meaning ""league of miles."" If you walked that far, you'd need a good rest too.  Whatever way you choose to use the word rest — whether it's something you do, something you take, or something you put your arm up on — you're describing a moment of stillness and calm. Rest also means ""the stuff left over."" Who will eat the rest of the cookies when you have to rest from eating so many of them?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0197,"<ul><li>Things that are separate are kept apart from other things. A married couple heading for divorce might eat breakfast at separate tables.</li><li>You can use the adjective separate to describe something that is thought of as different or not related to other things. The adjective is from the Latin prefix se- ""apart"" plus parare ""to prepare."" Separate is also used as a verb, pronounced ""SEP-uh-rate."" Separate is one of the most commonly misspelled words, so beware of the erroneous spelling, seperate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0198,"<ul><li>A site is a location. The leader of a Zombie Army might remind his underlings: “Your web site is just a collection of pages at one address on the Web. Your burial site is where you find more soldiers!”</li><li>Site can also refer to a specific parcel of land, such as a building site or a burial site. Although a website has no physical location, it does have a virtual one, which is reached the same way a physical location is: by going to an address.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0199,"<ul><li>The part of a dog's body that wags enthusiastically when the dog is happy is the tail. In mammals, tails are actually an extension of the spinal column.</li><li>Tails serve various purposes in different animals. A fish's tail helps it move through the water, a cow's tail is a built-in fly swatter, and a scorpion uses its tail for self-defense. This noun also means simply ""back end,"" like the tail of an airplane or the tail of a suit jacket. Colloquially, to tail someone means to follow them secretly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U10_0200,"<ul><li>Trouble is anything that causes difficulty, worry, and inconvenience, or that prevents you from doing something. If you have trouble getting along with a classmate, it is hard to be friendly with him or her.</li><li>Whether you have trouble finding your shoes, you're in trouble with your teacher, or you go to a lot of trouble buying the kind of tea your sister likes, you face an annoying — and possibly distressing — difficulty. When you use trouble as a verb, it tells who or what is making life hard for you, like a headache that troubles you or childhood memories of encounters with scary clowns that probably trouble you even more deeply.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0201,"<ul><li>The verb advertise means to publicize a service or product in order to try to get you to buy or use it. If you see people eating delicious-looking chocolate in a television commercial, for example, you'll probably want to buy it.</li><li>You don't have to use television, radio, or print media to advertise something — or even try to sell it at all. In fact, the word advertise can also simply mean to call attention to something. Your neighbors might advertise their lottery win by parking flashy cars in the driveway and having an endless supply of packages delivered to their house.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0202,"<ul><li>To be aware means to know about. If you're aware of a sled zooming towards you, move! And if you’re aware that the other kids wish they had sleds, share yours. That’s being socially aware. Well done.</li><li>Aware is a close relative of beware, ""look out for."" Julius Caesar is famously warned to ""beware the ides of March."" Too bad he's not aware of why. Beware and aware share the root ware, from an Old English word meaning ""careful."" Be aware of your purse at all times, and beware of the snatch-and-grab thief.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0203,"<ul><li>Battery is (among other things) physical attack or assault: “He was arrested for battery after he hit his manager several times on the head with a large flashlight.”</li><li>When you think of a battery, you probably envision the electrical devices that allow you to power everything in your life — from your car to your cell phone. However, battery has a whole host of meanings. In addition to beating someone as in ""assault and battery,"" it also refers to a collection of artillery or guns: “He’s collected a battery of weapons; we hope he doesn’t intend to use them."" Beyond guns, a battery can also refer to any group or collection of similar things: “She was subjected to a battery of tests, designed to determine whether she was a genius or just plain smart.”</li></ul>"

Total darkness.</li><li>Black is most commonly used as an adjective, but you can also use it as a noun, like when you say, ""The actors wore black."" Synonyms when used to describe color include inky, raven, and sable.  This word can also refer to an angry feeling, as in a black mood, or something wicked, like black magic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0205,"<ul><li>A city is an area in which a large number of people live fairly close together.  Cities usually have their own separate governments and systems for maintaining and providing utilities and transportation.</li><li>A city is basically a big town — the population is large in relation to the amount of land, since people often live in apartments or multi-family housing. The largest city in the world today is Shanghai, China. You can also call the residents of a city as a whole  a city: ""The city voted to increase recycling."" City comes from the Latin civitatem, ""citizenship,"" or ""community of citizens,"" from the root civis, ""citizen.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0206,"<ul><li>The meaning of clean usually refers to removing something unwanted: you clean your hands by washing them, then you can clean some grapes.</li><li>This word has many meanings related to being pure or empty. You clean a chicken by plucking its feathers, or get cleaned out when you lose all your money at poker. If a drug addict is clean, he's no longer using. You can clean someone’s clock, clean up your act, or clean out a safe and make a clean getaway. If the floor is clean enough to eat off, it's very clean. A clean life is morally pure.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0207,"<ul><li>A country is a nation, a body of land with one government. Also, rural areas outside cities and towns are called the country.</li><li>There are many countries in the world: places that have a central government and a common identity. America was once just a bunch of colonies of England. It wasn't until they fought for independence from England that America became a country. Also, ""the country"" is any place that's away from cities and rural: the country has farms and open spaces. Country life is quieter than city life — except for the early morning roosters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0208,"<ul><li>When something develops, it grows. And if you develop something, you create it. Your cold might develop into a rare disease, and you might just develop the vaccine to stop its spread.</li><li>Develop is a verb that means to build up, grow, or improve gradually over time. A developer is someone who develops land into shopping malls, schools, and skyscrapers. The process can take months, but eventually they will transform a pile of dirt into a building. Many years ago, people would develop photographs by dipping them into various chemicals. As the pictures developed, an image would gradually appear.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0209,"<ul><li>Things that are electric are either powered by electricity — like a battery-operated flashlight — or produce or transmit electricity — like an electric generator.</li><li>The word electric, indicating something charged with electricity, was used long before electricity was fully understood or harnessed as a form of power in the nineteenth century. In the seventeenth century, for example, materials like wool that produced sparks of static electricity when rubbed were termed electric by scientists, and the figurative meaning of the word was also used. Figuratively, electric can describe something exciting or brightly colored, as in ""electric atmosphere"" or ""electric green.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0210,"<ul><li>Eventually refers to an unspecific time when something will be completed, and it usually suggests it won't be done soon.</li><li>Think of eventually being said with a big sigh, as though the speaker knows that it will take a long time before something will be finished. Still, it does allow for the hope that, although it might not be anytime soon, it will be done at last — a promise fulfilled. Not now, maybe, but eventually.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0211,"<ul><li>You can't argue with facts: a fact is something proven to be true. It's important to distinguish between fact and fiction.</li><li>When someone says, ""Is that a fact?"" they're asking ""Is that really true?"" When a detective says, ""Give me the facts,"" he only wants information that is rock solid and confirmed. The job of science is to study things and figure out what the facts are in every field. Theories and opinions are not facts: you need to have proof for something to be a fact.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0212,"<ul><li>Glass is the hard, transparent material that's used to make windows. While glass can be strong and sturdy, it's also brittle and can be broken easily by an errant baseball.</li><li>Glass has all kinds of practical uses, from car windshields to greenhouse windows to jam jars to drinking glasses. When someone offers you a glass of water, they're referring to the vessel itself as a glass and also to amount it can hold — the glassful of liquid. The Old English source of glass is glæs, ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European root that means ""to shine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0213,"<ul><li>A history is a chronicle of events, like the history of the United States’ mission to put a man on the moon, or the world history class that you have to memorize all those dates for.</li><li>History is a noun to describe past events, or an account of something, like the history of New York City. When you describe something as having a history, you’re implying it has an intriguing past. For example, a necklace that’s been passed down through generations has a history. But when you say something's history, what you mean is not that it no longer exists. Your fear of the water is history now that you know how to swim.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0214,"<ul><li>Your nature is sort of the way you are — the sum total of how you think, feel, and behave. It might be in your nature to remain calm and level-headed when faced with a difficult challenge.</li><li>Things that aren't people can also have their own nature. You might notice the frantic nature of a political debate, or you might question the nature of your brother's friendships. Nature can also refer to the physical world made up of plants and animals: what you think of as ""the great outdoors."" You might be a nature lover who enjoys hiking. Nature can also describe natural forces, such as the destructive elements of nature, like a tsunami or a tornado.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0215,"<ul><li>The adverb never means ""at no time,"" or ""not at all."" If you're never going to win a Monopoly game against your brother, you won't beat him next week, next year, or when you're both 80 years old.</li><li>Something that never happens didn't occur in the past and won't ever occur in the future, either. Never is a blunt, absolute kind of word. If you wonder whether your dad will let you drive his BMW some day, and he responds, ""That's never going to happen,"" you can forget about it. The Old English root is næfre, a compound of ne, ""not or no,"" and æfre, ""ever.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0216,"<ul><li>Human beings are people. Individuals, folks, humankind — we're all people.</li><li>The word people is usually a noun, as in: two or more humans. It can also mean ""all the citizens,"" as in a political leader who understands the needs of the people. People can also be a verb meaning ""to inhabit or fill with people,"" as in: we need to people the empty seats so that tonight's speaker isn't disappointed with a small audience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0217,"<ul><li>Plastic is a synthetic material that can be molded when soft and formed into a solid shape. Many toys are made out of plastic, like Barbie dolls and Lego blocks.</li><li>Plastic appears in many different forms, from beach balls to lawn chairs, grocery bags and much more. Credit cards, which are made of plastic, are called plastic, meaning payment that's not cash. You can also use plastic as an adjective to describe things that can be molded, like clay that's plastic in your hands, or to describe something that's artificial. For example, if a person is called plastic, he or she is probably fake or insincere.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0218,"<ul><li>If you are facing something that will be difficult to handle, you have a problem on your hands. A problem is a roadblock in a situation, something that sets up a conflict and forces you to find a resolution.</li><li>The meaning of the Greek word próblēma meant ""to put forth,"" which is different from the meaning of problem today, but it reminds you that any problem becomes easier to solve once you have defined it.  A math problem is easier once you have the numbers in front of you: that's why word problems can be so difficult. Problem can also be an adjective in rare cases.  Once you were a problem child, but now you spend your time listening to everyone else's problems.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0219,"<ul><li>A street is a paved road with houses or buildings along the side. Cars, buses, bikes, and motorcycles travel in the street, while pedestrians use the sidewalk.</li><li>The street is what you drive a car on, but the word can also refer more generally to the neighborhood around the street, as in street theater or street fashion. And it can also mean a slightly dangerous, crime-filled environment: ""It's rough out there on the street."" In Old English, the word was stret, from the Late Latin phrase via strata or ""paved road.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U11_0220,"<ul><li>To think is to have an idea, belief, or thought about something. If you think that your parents are unusually strict, it means that you believe that to be true.</li><li>The verb think means to reason, consider, or mull over. If you think for a while before you decide whether or not to get in your friend's car, it means that you're contemplating the situation before you act. If you think that people shouldn't eat animals, it means that you hold that opinion. If you think up a new, delicious way to cook broccoli, it means that you've invented or conceived of a great cooking method.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0221,"<ul><li>The word alone comes from a combination of the Middle English words ""all"" and ""one,"" which is really all you need to know to understand the word. A person who is alone is all-in-one; there's no one else around.</li><li>Depending how you look at it, the word alone can have positive or negative connotations. A person with a bad attitude that no one wants to be around might find himself alone much of the time.  But someone seeking solitude, might choose to be alone. Then there are those people or things that are so unique or special that they alone possess a certain quality. Superman alone could save the world from the evil hand of Lex Luthor.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0222,"<ul><li>An apartment is a private residence in a building or house that's divided into several separate dwellings. An apartment can be one small room or several.</li><li>An apartment is a flat — it's usually a few rooms that you rent in a building. Your apartment might be in a fancy high rise with a doorman and an elevator, or over your parents' garage. Since the 1640s, an apartment has meant ""separate rooms within a house,"" from the Italian word appartimento, which literally means ""a separated place.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0223,"<ul><li>A piece of non-fiction prose written for a publication is one kind of article.</li><li>But a piece of a collection of something is also an article, like an article of clothing. If you're talking grammar, definite and indefinite articles are words, such as a, an, and the, whose purpose is to indicate, specify and limit a noun.  An article of faith is something that is firmly believed. And an article of organization or incorporation is a section of a legal document that sets out rules for a company.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0224,"<ul><li>An artist is someone whose life's work — or passionate hobby — focuses on some creative enterprise. If you love to paint portraits of your dog, you are an artist.</li><li>People who make films, write short stories, or build beautiful dollhouses are all artists. Doing anything that involves creativity and imagination, especially if it yields some finished project, is being an artist. Sometimes people use the word for someone who's great at what she does, or who uses extra flair or originality: ""That barista is a total artist — look, she made my latte foam look like a hedgehog!"" The Latin root is ars, or ""art.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0225,"<ul><li>An attitude is somewhere between a belief, a stance, a mood, and a pose. If you've got an attitude about something, it can be hard to change it because you think you're right.</li><li>You'll often hear Happy Hour referred to as ""Attitude Adjustment Hour,"" because cheap drinks are one of the best ways to change your attitude. If you're in a bad mood, cocktails can make it better (or worse). An attitude is a way of thinking that you can express just by standing a certain way. For example, putting your hands on your hips and rolling your eyes expresses one kind of attitude, while kneeling with your palms together expresses a very different one.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0226,"<ul><li>Ah, beauty. Anything that has it pleases the senses, like a delicious scent, a perfect piece of pie, or a gorgeous person walking by.</li><li>A noun describing an incredibly pleasing or harmonious quality or feature, beauty is hard to describe. Sure, super models and classical paintings exhibit beauty. But so do well designed sports cars and perfectly executed soccer goals. Belle found beauty in the Beast, astrologers find beauty in the stars, and arachnologists find beauty in giant hairy spiders. So that's why many people say that ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0227,"<ul><li>To compare is to look at two things and see how they are similar and different.</li><li>People compare all the time. If you look at two products and compare prices, you're looking for the better bargain. It is hard to compare who was the better athlete, Michael Jordan or Billie Jean King, because they played different sports. At a museum, you can compare different paintings. If you like your math teacher better than your history teacher, you're comparing the two. If a TV shows is bad, you could say ""it doesn't compare"" to your favorite show.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0228,"<ul><li>To judge is to form your own opinion. The critics didn't think much of the movie, but you decided to judge for yourself. Now you can't get your money back.</li><li>A person who judges, especially for a living, is known as a judge. To this day, you believe the judges cheated you out of the gold medal for figure skating because they didn't like your outfit. If you're wearing handcuffs and a police officer says, “Tell it to the judge,” that's the one in the black robes, not the one that holds up scorecards. Hopefully, this judge will like your outfit.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0229,"<ul><li>A magazine is a printed publication that comes out regularly and includes photographs and articles. Before cell phones became popular, people used to read magazines in doctors' waiting rooms.</li><li>Magazines were once only printed on paper, but today there are also online magazines. These electronic versions are similar to traditional magazines in that they publish periodically and include stories, illustrations or photos, and usually advertisements. The original definition of magazine was a space for ammunition storage, either in a building or ship, or attached to a weapon. The very first printed magazine was called ""Gentleman's Magazine,"" from the idea that it was a ""storehouse"" of knowledge.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0230,"<ul><li>Material is cloth from which clothes, curtains, or similar items can be created. If you sew your own bathing suit, it's important to make sure the material you use doesn't turn transparent when it gets wet.</li><li>The noun material can also refer to the items or substances used to create something. If you want to build a swing set, you'll need to buy materials like treated lumber, bolts, and screws. You can also use the adjective material to describe something that is worldly rather than spiritual. If you join that religious order, you are supposed to give up your material goods — even your convertible.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0231,"<ul><li>When you eat a meal, you sit down and dine on food. Breakfast is usually the first meal of the day, but if you oversleep your first meal might be lunch instead.</li><li>You can use the word meal to talk about the occasion (like dinner or brunch), or about the food itself. For example, you might say that chili and cornbread is your favorite meal during the colder months, or that a fast food hamburger eaten in the car is a poor excuse for a meal. Yet another meaning of meal is ""edible ground grain or beans,"" like cornmeal or soybean meal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0232,"<ul><li>There's a certain way of doing things. A systematic, logical process for accomplishing a task. And it's called a method.</li><li>There are methods of payment, production methods, and even ""method acting."" If someone asks if there's a ""method to your madness,"" she wants to make sure there's some kind of plan behind all the crazy stuff you're doing. If you've thought it through and have organized the next steps, go ahead and tell them to buzz off, it's just your method of getting things done.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0233,"<ul><li>A neighbor is a nearby person or thing. Be kind to your neighbor, for you never know when you will need to borrow sugar, a shovel, or the spare key to your house.</li><li>The noun neighbor, spelled neahgebur in Old English, translates to “near” “dweller” when broken down into its individual parts. It makes sense, then, that neighbor refers to a nearby person, place, or thing. “It’s a recession when your neighbor loses his job; it’s a depression when you lose yours,” quipped Harry S. Truman, the 33rd American president.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0234,"<ul><li>When an athlete ""goes pro,"" she goes professional–-she is paid for her service rather than doing it on an amateur basis. Other professionals, including doctors and lawyers, are also paid for their work, which, we hope, they conduct in a professional manner.</li><li>In the 15th century, the word profession referred to vows taken upon entering a religious order. A monk or priest professed his faith. Now, the word suggests competence and expertise and even dignity––""He can't ask me to go out for coffee. I'm a vice president. That just wouldn't be professional!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0235,"<ul><li>A profit is money you make, as opposed to money you lose. Also, anything good profits you — it benefits you.</li><li>When we talk about profits, we're talking about coming out ahead. Businesses need to make a profit — money — or they'll have to fire employees, cut expenses, and maybe go out of business entirely. If more money is coming in than going out, that's a profit. Profit also means a benefit. For example, you could profit from playing baseball even if you made no money from it. Getting exercise and fun would profit anybody quite a bit.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0236,"<ul><li>The qualities of something are its distinguishing features, and those can be good or bad. The qualities you look for when buying a tightrope might include strength and pliability, but you probably wouldn't want one with a slippery quality.</li><li>Quality can also be used as a purely positive term: ""you're a person of quality,"" or ""you've got a quality operation"" are entirely complimentary, meaning you and your operation are superior. There's a joke about how ""quality control"" in fast food chains assures that whenever you order a burger in a restaurant in that chain — whether you’re in Dallas or Des Moines — the quality is always the same — bad!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0237,"<ul><li>Before hiring a moving company to bring a grand piano into your studio apartment, you should measure how much space you actually have available.</li><li>Space, along with time, is one of the basic concepts of reality, but there are plenty of non-philosophical ways to use it. Don't let your dog sleep in the bed — she'll take up too much space. There's a space between each of these words. If you're into rockets, you probably want to travel in space, beyond the earth's atmosphere. A space in your day is free time. (Weird, right?) The root word spatium means ""area covered"" in Latin.</li></ul>"

English teachers never tire of talking about symbols in literature.</li><li>A pink ribbon is a symbol of breast-cancer awareness, and a yellow ribbon is a symbol of support for U.S. troops. In literature, authors use many symbols. A character doing even a small thing, like eating a cheeseburger, might symbolize something larger about that character. Something you need to be rich to have — like a limousine — is called a ""status symbol."" Anytime one thing seems to represent a deeper meaning, it's probably a symbol.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U12_0240,"<ul><li>Something thin is narrow or not very thick. If you wear thin socks on a cold winter day, your toes might start to feel numb.</li><li>Thin can describe something that is narrow and slender, like a hair or a thread. It can also describe a layer of something that is not very thick, such as paper. To thin something out is to make it lesser or weaker, like thinning out a sauce by adding water. You can also use this word figuratively. An argument that is not very convincing is thin.</li></ul>"

If you were very good at math in high school, you might think about going into accounting.</li><li>You can see the word count within accounting, which is one way to remember that the word has to do with keeping track of numbers — usually in relation to financial transactions. Balancing your checkbook is a form of accounting. Large firms often hire accountants to keep track of their earnings and spending. Accounting can also more generally mean explaining.  Someone who decides to wear shorts to the prom is likely going to have some serious accounting to do!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0242,"<ul><li>Appeal means ""to ask, or address."" If you appeal to someone's better nature, you're asking them for mercy. If a shirt doesn't appeal to you, you could also say it doesn't ""speak"" to you, or more simply, you don't like it.</li><li>Appeal can also be used as a noun to refer to a request, as in ""his parents ignored his appeal for a later curfew,"" or to refer to something's attractiveness or desirability, as in ""we all agreed on the appeal of a tropical vacation."" In judicial contexts, appeal means ""to call upon a higher court to review a lower court's decision."" If a lawyer appeals a court's conviction of her client, she's asking a higher court to throw the decision out. This word descends from the Latin appellare, ""to address, call upon.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0243,"<ul><li>Assume isn't only used to mean ""accept as truth without checking""; it also means ""take on the form of."" It might be safer if you don't assume that the vampire standing in front of you isn't merely a person assuming that form.</li><li>Assume always has the sense of taking on something. It may be the belief in the appearance of truth: Your mother probably assumes you do your homework right after school. It may be another form or identity: Superman assumes the identity of a city reporter. Or, it might be a physical space: If you get nervous while driving, your dad might assume control of the car.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0244,"<ul><li>The word borrow means to take something and use it temporarily. You can borrow a book from the library, or borrow twenty bucks from your mom, or even borrow an idea from your friend.</li><li>Usually , borrow implies taking something temporarily and returning it later. However, you can borrow non-physical things and adopt them as your own. For example, the English language has borrowed many words from other languages — such as Latin and Greek — but those words were never ""given back."" If you're subtracting numbers, you might have to borrow from the tens column to complete the problem.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0245,"<ul><li>If you pay for something, you are a client. If you pay to get your dog groomed, you are a client of the dog groomer (and so is your pooch).</li><li>If you shop at a certain store or use the services of a particular business, then you are a client of that store or business. If you want to go into acting, for example, you'll need to become a client of a talent agent. 
In computer terms, a client is a computer that makes a request of another computer, called a server. The term client is especially used in networks where one server may handle multiple requests from multiple clients.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0246,"<ul><li>Downtown is the area of a city that's the busiest, with the most shops, restaurants, buildings, and pedestrians. You can usually take a bus, train, or subway to get around downtown.</li><li>The widespread use of downtown probably started in New York City during the early 19th century. The original city hub was located at the southern tip of Manhattan, and as development proceeded northward, New Yorkers began to distinguish between downtown and uptown. In many cities today, downtown doesn't refer to the southern area of the city, just its heart or center.</li></ul>"

""Watching that movie will dull your senses, until you fall asleep.""</li><li>Let’s think of something interesting about dull. Hmm. It can be a verb or an adjective! So when you’re reading a dull or boring word description, for instance, it can dull or deaden your appetite for reading more word descriptions. That’s pretty fascinating, no? You can even use it for physical things, like a knife, which you can dull, that is, make it less sharp. You can even dull something visual, making it lacking in light, or use it describe pain — you know, the kind that is not sharp, just an ache. Exciting? No — dull.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0248,"<ul><li>If you embarrass someone, you make them feel self-conscious, awkward, or even stupid. Your mom might embarrass you by inviting your date to check out your childhood photos.</li><li>Embarrass actually has another meaning, but it's very rarely used: to blockade, hinder, obstruct, or stymie. Nowadays, we tend to embarrass one another (and ourselves) by pretty much sticking to the basics: making fun of our friends when they blunder, accidentally revealing secrets in public, confessing our undying love to people who don't even know we exist, and all the millions of creative and frustrating ways we have of making mistakes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0249,"<ul><li>It's not fair that fare means three unrelated things. As a verb, it means to proceed or get along, as in ""Fare thee well."" As a noun, it can refer to the cost of travel (""Train fare is ten dollars"") or to food (""Tatertots are typical cafeteria fare"").</li><li>Although this word has multiple meanings, they can all be traced back to the Old English root for ""journey."" If you’re taking a trip, fare well! If you do fare well, you'll have a great time. A taxi looking for a fare might give you a ride to the airport (though you'll have to pay the fare).

For example, someone who believes in reincarnation might wonder about their former life — or even lives — before their present existence.</li><li>When something or someone has changed, we can refer to them as former. For example, Mr. Smith's ex-wife could be known as the former Mrs. Smith. We could consider almost anything as former, as long as it comes first, before something else. A good way to remember the meaning of former is to consider that it comes from the Old English forma, which means ""first,"" and that both former and first begin with ""f.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0251,"<ul><li>To found something is like laying a ""foundation"" for a building — note the similarity?  But instead of a building, you might found a business or a charity, where you establish the groundwork upon which it can grow.</li><li>The verb found goes back to the Latin word fundus, meaning ""bottom,"" which in turn led to fundāre, meaning ""to lay the bottom of something.""   If you were to found a library, they might build a statue of you near the entrance.  If you're having trouble finding the library, look for a statue with a familiar face.</li></ul>"

You can invest your hopes or emotions in a person. The money, time, or hope is called the investment. Invest can also mean to endow with a power or quality. Laws invest police officers with abilities that regular citizens do not have. Invest originally meant to clothe. In fact, there is a room in some churches still called a vestry where priests get into their garb.</li></ul>"

If you loan someone your car, make sure he's a good driver. You might loan your friend a sweatshirt if she's cold and doesn't have one. Expect to get both your car and your sweatshirt back. A word that is borrowed from another language is called a loanword, like the word karaoke, which is Japanese.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0254,"<ul><li>A stapler is a practical object — it has a use. A hand-crocheted stapler cozy designed to keep a stapler warm at night? Not practical at all.</li><li>The word practice, in the sense of ""doing,"" is embedded in the word practical, which is all about ""doing."" ""Is it practical?"" means, is it good to do this? Does it have a use? Will it work? Silk shoes in a rainstorm? They're just not practical. A London Fog raincoat? Definitely practical.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0255,"<ul><li>A quarter is one-fourth of something. If you cut a pizza into four pieces and share it with three friends, each of you will eat a quarter of the pizza.</li><li>A quarter is the same thing as twenty-five percent of something. Many sporting events are divided this way, and you'll often hear sports commentators saying things like, ""Here is the score at the end of the first quarter."" The Latin word quartus, ""fourth,"" is at the root of quarter, and the earliest — and goriest — use specifically referred to a form of execution that involved dismembering a prisoner's body into four pieces, or quarters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0256,"<ul><li>The pay or wages you earn for doing your job is called your salary. You might prefer your low-paying job to one with a higher salary because you have so much fun with your co-workers.</li><li>Salary comes from the Latin word salarium, which also means ""salary"" and has the root sal, or ""salt."" In ancient Rome, it specifically meant the amount of money allotted to a Roman soldier to buy salt, which was an expensive but essential commodity. Today, salt is an inexpensive purchase at the grocery store, and your salary is certainly to be paid in your country's currency.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0257,"<ul><li>Scholarship is the research done by academics. Or if you receive a scholarship, you're getting an award that will help pay the cost of tuition at school.</li><li>If you're getting ready for college, chances are you're also looking to see if any scholarships are available. A scholarship is a great thing to get: it means you don't have to pay full tuition to go to a school. Scholarships are awarded for good grades, athletic success, and other accomplishments. Once you get in to school, you'll be engaged in another kind of scholarship — the kind that has to do with research, studying, and higher learning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0258,"<ul><li>Use the adjective temporary to describe something that is not permanent. ""Oh my goodness! That's a tattoo,"" your mother might shriek. You might tell her not to worry, since it's only temporary, and will wear off in a few days.</li><li>The adjective temporary is used to describe something that isn't permanent or lasts only a short time. Its roots are in the Latin word tempus, meaning ""time or season."" An employee who isn't a permanent addition to the staff is temporary and in this use, the word is often shortened to temp. The lull in the wind and rain is only temporary, because you know you are in the eye of the storm.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0259,"<ul><li>Treasure is usually associated with riches — gold, jewels, doubloons — the stuff contained in pirates' treasure chests. However, you can also treasure things with purely sentimental value — like your pet rock or your blankie.</li><li>The English word treasure comes from the Old French tresor, both meaning ""something of great worth."" Still, the French tresor sounds so much more luxurious than the English treasure, and that form is the chosen name for an expensive perfume. Worth is relative, though. Going back further, we find that the Latin word for treasury is thesaurus, which is what a book of synonyms is called. Guess the ancients always understood the richness — and worth — of words.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U13_0260,"<ul><li>If you have an urge to eat candy, you really want to eat those sweets. Your mother might urge you to wait until after dinner. As a noun, urge means a desire. As a verb, it means to strongly encourage.</li><li>Urge is related to the word, urgent, or 'pressing.' An urge is a pressing want, one that is almost a compulsion, like when you're so frustrated, you have the urge to scream. If you urge someone to do something, you feel strongly about it. You might urge a friend to wear an orange shirt not because you happen to like orange, but because they're walking in the woods during hunting season.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0261,"<ul><li>Nowadays, we mostly think of a coach as someone who trains a team, but it can also refer to a vehicle, such as a horse-drawn coach or coach bus (the kind with a bathroom in the back).</li><li>The first meaning of coach was in the mid-16th Century for a carriage, probably named for Kocs, the Hungarian village where they were first made and called kocsi. In the mid-19th Century, the name was given to railway cars, and nowadays the least expensive travel class is described as ""coach."" It's thought that the idea of a coach as a teacher came about because of the idea that a coach ""carries"" a student to success through his or her teaching.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0262,"<ul><li>To have control is to have the power to run something in an orderly way. A skillful teacher maintains control over students who might otherwise waste time or be disruptive.</li><li>A control can also be a device used to operate a machine, like the remote control for a television. The control in an experiment is the group that gets left alone so scientists can compare ""before and after"" changes in other groups. The verb control means ""to be in charge."" If you're a group's treasurer, you control its finances. It can also mean ""hold back."" You might need to control your hyperactive puppy when the mail carrier comes around.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0263,"<ul><li>A description puts something in words, like a portrait puts a person in paint. The lawnmower you came home with did not quite fit the description of the dishwasher you went shopping for.</li><li>The root for description is the Latin word descriptio, meaning “to write down.” The “script” in description tells you that a good description makes what it describes come to life, like a script for a movie. Your description of that fudge almond swirl ice cream was so good I could taste it! Unfortunately, I'm allergic to nuts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0264,"<ul><li>If you direct somebody, you tell them where to go or what to do. You can also direct a play or direct someone to a gas station, by telling them what roads to take.</li><li>Most uses of direct involving giving orders. Army officers direct battles, which means they plan what to do and how to carry it out. You can direct a kick toward the goal, which means you send the ball flying toward the net. When used as an adjective, direct often means to the point with no beating around the bush. If someone is direct, it means they say what they mean; if a plant is in direct sunlight, it gets a lot of sun.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0265,"<ul><li>An exam is a test. Many high school and college classes have a midterm exam and a final exam.</li><li>The word exam is short for examination, from 19th century student slang. An exam usually takes place in a class and consists of questions that test a student's knowledge. Sometimes the word describes a medical test of some kind, like an eye exam, a dental exam, or a physical exam. Rather than testing knowledge or skill, these exams are procedures meant to diagnose or rule out illnesses.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0266,"<ul><li>An example is a particular instance of something that is representative of a group, or an illustration of something that's been generally described.</li><li>Example comes from the Latin word for ""specimen."" If you want an example of mainstream teen fashion, find a 13-year old in a mall. If you set a good example, then you show your peers how they should behave. But if you’re an unrepentant criminal and you keep getting in trouble, a judge might give you a really long prison sentence, as an example to other unrepentant criminals out there.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0267,"<ul><li>A limit is a boundary, or how far something can go, or the maximum amount of something. When you reach the limit, imagine a little sign saying ""the end.""</li><li>There's a limit to how much weight you can lift, how many words can be written in an hour, or how long someone can stay awake. Once you pass the city limits, you have left town. Sporting events have time limits. As a verb,  you can limit how much chocolate your kids are allowed to eat. And if you don't feel like writing much, you'll limit your essay to just 400 words instead of 500.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0268,"<ul><li>The adjective local describes something related a specific place. The potholes on a certain street in Pringle, Pennsylvania, might merit a story in the local newspaper.</li><li>Locate, location, locale — they all look and sound like local thanks to the Latin root locus, which means ""place."" Something that's local is limited to a specific place, like a particular neighborhood or city. Local also can describe places that aren't, well, places — they're more like areas. For example, a dentist might administer a local anesthetic to numb your mouth when filling a cavity. That means the anesthetic acts only on a specific area of the body.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0269,"<ul><li>Something magical seems to work by way of some mysterious, unseen force. If you had magical powers, you could make annoying people disappear or instantly fill your room with adorable kittens.</li><li>Wizards and witches are know for their magical and sometimes evil powers. However, a gorgeous sunset or a perfect day at Disney World can also feel magical. Magical comes from the Greek magikos, (also ""magical""), from magos, ""member of the learned and priestly class,"" probably stemming from the Proto-Indo-European magh-, ""to have power.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0270,"<ul><li>Mail is anything that's delivered to your mail box or post office box — letters, bills, packages, magazines, or anything else that's sent through the postal service. Email is the internet's version of mail.</li><li>Mail carriers' bags are full of mail, and the system that allows this mail to be delivered all over the world is also called the mail. As a verb, to mail something is to send it via this system: when you write a letter, address and stamp it, and put it in a mailbox, you mail it. Mail is also the name for a type of light armor made of interlocking metal rings. If you read a novel about a knight wearing mail, he's wearing this type of armor — he's not covered in letters!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0271,"<ul><li>If something is so new and original that it's never been seen, used or even thought of before, call it novel. The noun novel describes a book-length work of fiction.</li><li>New and novel come from the same Indo-European root but by different paths. Whereas new is a Germanic word coming from Old English, novel is based on Latin novellus ""new, young, fresh."" If something is novel, it is new but also original, fresh and unique. Companies are always looking for that novel idea that will earn them millions and skydiving is a novel experience, especially if you're not adventurous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0272,"<ul><li>The gist, the essence, the major parts of something — that's its outline.</li><li>The origins of outline come from the artistic practice of marking a line around the outer edge of a person or shape in a picture before filling it in. Only later, in the 1800s, did it come to be applied to verbal descriptions, too. Technically an outline suggests a condensed form of something, but as any high school or college student knows, course outlines have a habit of being pretty darn long. In 1919 H.G. Wells wrote a book called An Outline of History. Its length? 1,324 pages.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0273,"<ul><li>If you’re a poet and you know it, you’re someone who writes poems. Poets have been charming people with their words ever since Orpheus sang his way to Hades and back.</li><li>A poet is a writer who regularly publishes poems, but a poet can also be anyone who uses language creatively. Try it! The root of poet can be traced back to the Greek poein, ""to make."" Some poets write in carefully metered, rhyming lines, while others compose looser prose poems or ""free verse,"" and the very best poets convey something that's essential or true. The Romantic poet William Wordsworth described good poetry as “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0274,"<ul><li>Print is text, type, or writing — it's the words you write on paper or read in a book. If you print your name, you don’t write it in cursive. You write it so someone can actually read it.</li><li>When something's ""in print,"" it's been published. Another kind of print, besides text (letters, numbers, and characters), is the impression left by a finger (a fingerprint), a foot, or even an animal's paw. The verb to print means to write in clear, block letters, or to publish a copy of a book, newspaper, or magazine. If something's ""out of print,"" it's hard to find because no one is publishing new copies of it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0275,"<ul><li>A scene is where something happens or happened. How did you know that the thief would return to the scene of the crime?</li><li>Scene can also describe part of a movie or a play. Did the last scene make you laugh, cry, or fall asleep?  There are lots of common phrases that use the word scene. If you “make a scene,”  you draw attention to yourself with some kind of outburst. If something happens “behind the scenes,” the public doesn't know about it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0276,"<ul><li>A sheet is a large, wide amount of something flat, like a sheet of metal or a sheet of paper. When it goes on your bed, a sheet is a similar expanse of fabric.</li><li>The sheets on your bed cover your mattress and lie beneath your blanket or comforter, and the huge windows in your imaginary dream house would require enormous sheets of glass. Sheet music consists of musical notation written on sheets of paper, and a sheet of rain comes down so hard it looks like a solid surface. If it rained overnight and the water froze on the ground, you might say, ""Careful, it's a sheet of ice outside!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0277,"<ul><li>Silly describes something that can't be taken seriously. You might not mind telling silly jokes, but you don't want to be told a project you've worked hard at is silly.</li><li>Silly originally meant “happy,” which gives the sense of children's games or harmless jokes. Later, it came to mean “foolish”: silly ideas are looked down on because they're not very smart. Silly can also mean a state of foolishness brought on in a specific way. Your mother “worried herself silly” when you stayed out late, and promised to “slap you silly” when you got home.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0278,"<ul><li>As the sentence ""This store stores a large store of rubber ducks"" will tell you, store is a word with a lot of definitions. Among these are ""a place that sells items,"" ""the act of keeping things for future use,"" and ""a supply of something.""</li><li>As a noun, store often refers to a place where things are sold, such as an electronics store. This meaning of the word likely sprang up from the original meaning, ""a supply of something kept for future use."" As a verb, store refers to the act of putting things away for later. Chipmunks store nuts in their cheeks, people store their winter clothes when springtime arrives, and techies store information on backup drives.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0279,"<ul><li>The verb suffer means to feel pain or something equally unpleasant. You'd probably do anything you could to be sure your beloved cat didn't suffer when she got old and sick.</li><li>You can suffer from the pain of a broken leg, but you can also suffer from shyness, regret, poverty, or any number of unpleasant things. You can even describe something that becomes worse using the word suffer, like when someone's grades suffer during soccer season. The root of suffer is the Latin word sufferre, to bear, undergo, or endure. That's why someone who doesn't suffer fools gladly won't put up with nonsense.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U14_0280,"<ul><li>Technology is using science to solve a problem or create a product. You probably have some gadgets and gizmos, like cell phones and video games, that you really enjoy. These are products of technology.</li><li>Technology consists of all the things science allows people to make and do. New cars, new surgical techniques, new computers, and even robots are all examples of technology. Since science is always advancing, technology is too. The more scientists learn, the more technology allows us to do — it's very exciting.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0281,"<ul><li>Across describes something that's situated on the opposite side or the direction you have to go to get from one side to another.</li><li>Thinking about swimming across the English Channel? It's 23.7 miles across from England to France, so you might want to take a boat instead. The phrase ""across the board"" means that all parts of something are affected. But it originally came from horse racing, to describe when someone bet equal amounts of money on a horse to come in first, second, or third place. The ""board"" was the blackboard where bookmakers chalked up the odds for each horse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0282,"<ul><li>When you breathe you take air into your lungs and let it out in a regular rhythm. Living things need to breathe to live.</li><li>This word has several meanings related to living and taking in air. When someone says ""As long as I breathe!"" they mean ""As long as I live!"" In music, some silence can let the piece breathe. If you need a moment or room to breathe, you need a break. Wine breathes when it’s uncorked, enhancing its flavor. Breathing life into something gives it new energy. If this explanation has made you nervous, breathe deeply — that helps many people to relax.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0283,"<ul><li>If something is a characteristic of someone or something, it is a feature you would expect. A characteristic of classical-style architecture is large stone columns. A characteristic of poodles is their pom-pom like tails.</li><li>A characteristic feature needn't just be a something physically apparent, it can describe a type of personality or atmosphere as well, as in: ""The characteristic of all funeral homes is their gloomy air."" As their spelling and meaning implies, there is a close link between the words characteristic and character, meaning the essential nature of a thing, and in fact both words come from the ancient Greek kharackter, meaning a ""symbol or imprint on the soul.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0284,"<ul><li>""The Freshman 15"" describes freshman-year college students who gain about fifteen pounds because they consume way too much lousy dorm food all day long.</li><li>To consume a cake is to eat it, the idea being that you ate the whole thing. To say a fire consumed a building is to say that the entire building was destroyed. Consume means to devour, to take in, to use up. The Unites States is often referred to as a consumer society because our economy is based on things being consumed. Whether it's gas, clothes, burgers, music, or anything that we use up as we purchase it, it's something that we consume. If we consume all the oil, there will be none left to burn.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0285,"<ul><li>To excite is to stimulate, animate, or energize. The return of your favorite TV show might excite you, and winning millions of dollars in the lottery will definitely excite you.</li><li>While a new book by a beloved author excites one person, and an extra scoop of ice cream excites another, it might take something like a free trip to Hawaii to excite you. In quantum mechanics, the word excite takes on a more scientific meaning: to raise something, like an atom or an electron, to a higher level of energy. The Latin root of excite is excitare, ""rouse, call out, or summon forth.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0286,"<ul><li>Extremely is a word that emphasizes the intensity of whatever it is you're talking about. If you say you're extremely angry, that word alone tells me I better not mess with you.</li><li>Extremely comes from the word extreme, which means great, severe, or exceptional. If you climb to extreme heights on a mountain, you've climbed extremely high. Use extremely to let people know that what you're talking about exceeds or goes beyond the norm. A joke that's not just funny, but extremely funny, is one that might have you gasping to catch your breath from laughing so hard.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0287,"<ul><li>Does the sight of a snake fill you with panic and the desire to run away as quickly as possible? If so, you have a fear of snakes.</li><li>People have fear for many things: bugs, guns, heights, etc. Horror movies try to fill the audience with fear. Some fears make more sense than others. The fear of jumping out of planes makes a lot of sense, but the fear of public speaking isn't as logical: it won't kill you. Fear includes anxiety and can be very emotionally painful. If you're scared of anything, you know what fear is all about.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0288,"<ul><li>If you are lucky, you are fortunate. You can be fortunate to have avoided something terrible and you can be fortunate to have acquired, won, or been bestowed with something better than those around you, like wealth and good looks.</li><li>The adjective fortunate comes from the Latin word fortunatus, meaning “prospered,” “prosperous,” “lucky,” or “happy.” Fortunate is related to the word fortune and they have similar meanings, in the sense that those fortunate enough to have a fortune most likely have gobs of money and are sometimes called “the fortunate.” When it comes to predicting the future, you could get bad news from a fortune teller about what’s in store for you, but if you’re fortunate — she’ll say something good.</li></ul>"

You can measure the length of a table or the length of a movie.</li><li>If an object has multiple distances to be measured (like a rectangle for example), then length is taken to be the longest of the measurements (as opposed to the width, in the case of the rectangle). Before babies learn to walk, they are measured for length, but once they begin to stand reliably the same measurement changes names, and become height.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0291,"<ul><li>A mistake is an error, a goof, a slip-up. When you make a mistake, you've done something incorrectly.</li><li>Mistake has a lot of uses, but they all have to do with doing the wrong thing. A mistake in math class will result in the wrong answer, but a mistake with a gun could get someone killed. If you mix up two people, you're mistaking one for the other. When you make a mistake, the best thing to do is admit it and try to make up for it; not apologizing for a mistake is another mistake.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0292,"<ul><li>Observe is often used to mean “remark” or “comment.” When trying to start up a conversation with an attractive stranger, you might observe that it’s raining outside (but hopefully you’ll come up with something more interesting to say).</li><li>Observe has several secondary meanings, one of which is “notice” or “discover.” If you start a conversation with that attractive stranger, you’ll probably observe whether he or she seems interested in talking to you.  Observe can also mean “watch carefully with great interest”; you might be tempted to observe the attractive stranger in this manner, but that might make him or her uncomfortable. Try to stay cool.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0293,"<ul><li>Seize the noun, opportunity, if you're talking about circumstances that allow you do to something you'd like to do. Wouldn't you love to have the opportunity to meet your favorite musician?</li><li>When the situation is right for you to do something you're interested in doing, you have the opportunity to do it. The word comes from the Latin phrase, ob portum veniens ""coming toward a port"" which refers to a favorable wind blowing ships into the harbor. Think of an opportunity as something a good wind blew your way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0294,"<ul><li>A prize is the reward or recognition a winner gets. When you win first prize in your state spelling bee, you might get a medal and a trip to the national competition in Washington, DC.</li><li>Many prizes are given for hard work, athletic skill, or superior intellect, but it's also possible to win a prize from sheer good luck. The prize for a winning lottery ticket, for example, might be a million dollars. If your dog comes in first at an obedience competition, you can call her your ""prize pup."" And if you adore and value that dog more than anything else, you can say you prize her.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0295,"<ul><li>Race means to speed or move quickly. A race is a contest to see who is moving the quickest. Race can also mean genetic grouping––if you are reading this, chances are you're a member of the ""human race.""</li><li>After watching an exciting horse race, your heart may be racing, meaning your pulse is moving fast. You may find yourself racing through your day if you have too much to do, or you might race a friend home from school to see which is fastest, walking or taking the bus. On a form that asks you your race, you will often be prompted with racial categories, such as Caucasian, African-American, or Native American.</li></ul>"

Surprise!</li><li>Realize usually describes the moment your thoughts click, like the moment you close the door behind you, you realize you don't have your keys. You are locked out! So you knock on your neighbor's door. You realize, here meaning that you are fully aware, that she might not appreciate having to help you because she's trying to leave for work. You tell her your new goal is to be more organized. She says, until you realize, or reach, that  goal, you better hide an extra key somewhere in your yard.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0297,"<ul><li>Invited to a great party? You might respond by shouting ""Hooray!"" and then letting your friend know you'll be there. To respond is to react or reply.</li><li>Fireman, police, and EMTs are known as first responders. This is because they are the first people to respond to an emergency. If you get into an accident, an EMT might check your reflexes to see how they respond.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0298,"<ul><li>A risk is an action that holds a chance of danger or failure. Although it's fun jump around on glaciers, the risk of falling down a crack into a freezing lake might deter you from ice climbing.</li><li>Risk comes from the French for danger. As nouns, risk and danger are close synonyms. The verb risk means to run a danger, in hopes of reward. So risk is similar to gamble. If you're very ill, you might risk a dangerous surgery. We also use risk for money or security. You can risk your good health by working with infected patients without sterile equipment. Or you can risk your life savings on the stock market.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U15_0299,"<ul><li>When you wonder about something, you want to learn more about it. You wonder why the car is making that noise so you ask the mechanic to explain it.</li><li>Wonder comes from the Old English word wundor, which means ""marvelous thing, the object of astonishment."" For example, the Taj Mahal is one of the great wonders of the world, so beautiful and magical. But wonders are all around us — anything that amazes and marvels is a wonder, like high-definition television, the Internet, your mom's homemade pizza — though we tend to forget this because we are used to them.</li></ul>"

You may need to study hard yet again to try to pass a re-test. And even if an exam hasn't happened yet, you might worry it will be a disaster.</li><li>Yet is often used like but when connecting two ideas that contrast — as in, ""I love apples, yet I hate applesauce."" When yet is not being used as a contrast, it means ""more"" or ""in the future"" (which is really just more time). If you've been rehearsing for the school play for weeks, but still don't know your lines, you'll need yet more rehearsals if it's going to be a success.</li></ul>"

The noun book can refer to a bunch of pages bound together, as in a book you read, but also a book of tickets or stamps, a section of a larger work of literature (like a book of the Bible), or the written script of a stage play.

Dinner has always been the main meal, but it used to be served in the middle of the day and supper was last.

When you buy a length of fabric, the leftover bit is an end, and the final point of almost anything — a play or a marriage — is also an end. When you end something, you make it conclude.

We use health to talk about bodies and people, but also to talk about whole systems. If you lost your job, you might be worried about the health of your finances. If a bad manager provokes employees to be unproductive, investors might be worried about the health of a business.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U18_0357,"<ul><li>A recipe is directions for making a dish or dessert, like your mother's award-winning recipe for chocolate chip cookies.</li><li>The word recipe is most often used when talking about cooking. It includes two things: a list of ingredients that you'll need and the steps to take in order to make it. You can find recipes in cookbooks, on Web sites, in newspapers and magazines — or handed down in your family. Other than cooking, a recipe can also be a formula: the recipe for success is hard work, good timing and a little luck.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U18_0358,"<ul><li>A restaurant is a place — usually inside a building — where you go to eat food, which, most of the time, you must pay for.</li><li>Restaurant comes from the French restaurer, which means ""to provide food for."" Restaurants will provide food for you if you've got the cash, and most of the time they'll even let you sit down right there and eat it. Common examples of restaurants include burger joints, cafeterias, pizzerias, sandwich shops, steak houses, seafood shacks, (some) hot-dog stands, ice cream parlors, taquerias, Chinese takeout, (some) bakeries, and fine-dining establishments.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U18_0359,"<ul><li>Special means ""better than ordinary."" Like the self-portrait you lovingly painted as a surprise for your sweetie's birthday, something special is distinct, and surpasses the norm.</li><li>Something special is looked upon with affection, surpasses expectations, or has a particular role. It can also be a featured attraction or limited-run occurrence — like when there's a special on television or a special on cheese at the store. Ray Charles said, “Love is a special word, and I use it only when I mean it. You say the word too much and it becomes cheap.” Take this sweet crooner’s advice and don’t wear out special sentiments.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U18_0360,"<ul><li>The liquid that is made up of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen is water. Water takes up over seventy percent of the earth’s surface. Your body is made of about sixty percent water.</li><li>Water can be a noun: it is the colorless, odorless liquid that all living things need to survive. Water can be a verb: as in watering the plants, getting teary, or urinating. When people talk about freezing and boiling, they are usually talking about the temperatures at which water freezes (32˚ F) and boils (212˚ F). Humans use water to bathe, cook, make fountains in the backyard, and mix with lemon juice and sugar to make lemonade.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0361,"<ul><li>If you're alive, you're living — in other words, you're not dead. If your apple tree blooms in the spring, you'll know it's still alive after the long, cold winter.</li><li>Living things are alive — people, animals, plants — but things can be alive figuratively as well. You might, for example, talk about keeping optimism alive or keeping the school music program alive. The word is often used to mean ""spirited"" or ""full of energy,"" too, as when a birthday party comes alive just as the magician and the pony arrive. Alive comes from the Old English phrase on life, ""in living"" or ""in life.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0362,"<ul><li>A bone is a single section of a skeleton, made of very hard tissue. Adult human bodies have 206 bones.</li><li>Your skeleton, which forms the structure of your body, is made up of many different bones, from the tiny bones in your fingers and toes to the largest bone, the femur, or thigh bone. All vertebrates, or animals with spines, have bones — your dog may enjoy gnawing on a bone that originally came from a cow, for example. Informally, when you ""bone up on something,"" you study it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0363,"<ul><li>The word bother has many shades of meaning, but most of them involve trouble of some sort. You might wonder why you should bother to follow a recipe, until you taste what you've made without one.</li><li>As a verb, bother can mean that you take the trouble to do something. It’s often presented as a negative: you might not bother to lock the house, or you may wonder why you should bother reading the instructions that came with your phone. Bother can also mean that you’re bugging someone or causing a minor inconvenience. The word can also have a sense of deeper worry, especially when something is bothering you, like a nagging sense of guilt.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0364,"<ul><li>A captain is the person in charge of a group. The captain of a high school soccer team is usually an elected or appointed leader.</li><li>The word captain can describe any leader, but it's traditionally been the name for the person on a boat or ship with the highest rank. The captain of a fishing boat is responsible for making decisions about what route to take and how best to avoid bad weather. When she steers the boat, you can say she captains it. The word comes from the Late Latin capitaneus, ""chief,"" from caput, or ""head.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0365,"<ul><li>A conclusion is the last part of something, its end or result. When you write a paper, you always end by summing up your arguments and drawing a conclusion about what you've been writing about.</li><li>The phrase in conclusion means ""finally, to sum up,"" and is used to introduce some final comments at the end of a speech or piece of writing. The phrase jump to conclusions means ""to come to a judgment without enough evidence."" A foregone conclusion is an outcome that seems certain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0366,"<ul><li>Doubt is distrust or suspicion. When your kid sister explains that a robber broke in and ate your entire chocolate stash, most likely you feel doubt.</li><li>When you're in doubt, you really can't tell what's true and what's false, whether that's a news story or whether you want to marry someone or whether you'll survive Med school. The Latin root of doubt is dubitāre, ""to hesitate, waver,"" and when you doubt something you're wavering: I think I believe you, but maybe I don't. But maybe I do. But maybe not? One thing not to doubt is the silent b. Pronounce: DOWT.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0367,"<ul><li>Explore is a verb that means ""to travel in or through."" You might explore an island, a European city, or the rooms of an unfamiliar house.</li><li>The Latin root of explore is explorare, meaning ""investigate or search out."" When you explore a new place, you want to see interesting things and get to know its people. Whenever you delve into something, or investigate it, you explore it. You can even explore an interest, like when you explore African art, or explore an idea or tendency in order to understand it — you can explore your fear of snakes to try to get over it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0368,"<ul><li>Glad is how you feel when you hear that something nice happened to someone you care about, or when you learn you got an A on that test you studied so hard for. It means happy or pleased.</li><li>Glad doesn't quite mean jumping for joy — it's more a state of contentment and pleasure. You're glad to hear from an old friend who calls you out of the blue and glad to meet your friendly new neighbors. Glad can also mean ""eagerly willing"" so you might say, ""I'll be glad to taste test those brownies for you!"" The Old English source is glæd, ""gleaming, joyous, or gracious.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0369,"<ul><li>However means ""even so"" or, ""on the other hand,"" and you use it to introduce a complication or contradiction. You might tell your friend, ""I love your cooking. However, I already have plans for dinner tonight.""</li><li>The adverb however has a few different meanings. It often shows contrast. You might be training to become a lawyer, however your secret dream is to dance. However also means ""in whatever way."" You might say to your father, ""However you have to do it, convince Mom to buy me that car!"" It also means ""to whatever degree."" However certain you are in your gut that Mr. Plum is the murderer, you need to wait for evidence before accusing him.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0370,"<ul><li>Life isn’t fair, and that quality is exactly what defines injustice: something unfair that happens, often in violation of a basic human right.</li><li>In the early 19th century in the United States, women could not legally vote, but they fought back against this injustice and eventually won voting rights.  The word comes from a Latin phrase that literally means “not right,” and injustice is the opposite of justice, which is a fair and righteous act.  Injustice can be general or specific, like the injustice suffered by poor people everywhere, or an individual act of injustice committed by some unkind person.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0371,"<ul><li>International is an adjective that describes something that involves two or more countries, like international laws that multiple countries obey, or an international flight from France to Japan.</li><li>Break international into two halves to understand its meaning.  The first half is the prefix inter-, which means “among,” or “between.” In the second half, you can see the word nation.  Put them together and the word literally means “among or between nations.”  Driving from the United States into Canada is an international road trip since you travel from on nation to another, and an international conference has guests from all over the world.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0372,"<ul><li>A lawyer is a professional who is qualified to offer advice about the law or represent someone in legal matters. A lawyer can also be called an attorney, a solicitor, a counselor, a barrister, or — pejoratively — an ambulance chaser.</li><li>A lawyer can handle all sorts of legal matters from drafting wills to patent claims to defending people against criminal charges. Qualified lawyers have to attend law school and pass a bar exam in order to practice law. Lawyer, of course, means one who practices the law. ""Law"" itself comes from the Old Norse root word lag, which means something laid down or fixed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0373,"<ul><li>To mention something is to bring it up. If your mother embarrasses you by constantly mentioning your stuffed animal that you've been sleeping with for the past 15 years, you might mention it to her.</li><li>In the context of awards, an ""honorable mention"" is an official recognition but not a prize. If you enter a writing competition, the judges might not think your piece is the best, but they might mention, or briefly say, that it came very close to winning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0374,"<ul><li>Use the adjective old to describe someone who's been alive for a long time. When you're 30, 60 seems old, and when you're 60, 90 seems old. When you're 90, face it, you're old!</li><li>The adjective old also means former. It can be fun to visit your favorite teachers at your old elementary school, or to drive through your old neighborhood. You can use old to describe something of long duration, like your old friends from camp who you visit every summer. Old also has numerous informal or slang uses, like the phrase ""any old,"" which you'd use to say, ""I don't want just any old job; I want to be a circus clown.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0375,"<ul><li>Did you just come up with a plan for reducing the number of paper clips your department uses at work each month? Then you’ve created a policy, a plan of action.</li><li>The noun policy can be used to refer to a plan developed by an individual or a group. You’ll often see the word used to describe a plan developed by a government, such as a housing policy or a defense policy. A policy typically outlines a specific course of action designed to further the general goals of the group. The word can also be used to describe a formal written agreement, such as an insurance policy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0376,"<ul><li>If you are social, you like to be around people. A social butterfly is someone who is social or friendly with everyone, flitting from person to person, the way a butterfly might.</li><li>The word social comes from the Latin socius meaning ""friend."" When you're being social, you're everyone's friend. Go to a social, or mixer, and you might make a lot of new friends. Stand in the corner pouting, however, and you're being anti-social. Humans are described as social beings — ones that tend to move or live in groups together, like penguins!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0377,"<ul><li>When you say something out loud, that's speech. When you give a speech, you say a lot of things in front of a group. Maybe you should open with a joke?</li><li>The ability to produce and understand speech in complex ways has long been considered part of what separates humans from other animals. ""Freedom of speech"" is the right to express your thoughts and opinions publicly.  Adjectives, nouns and verbs are ""parts of speech."" By the way: speech is a noun.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U19_0378,"<ul><li>Staff means everyone who works at a particular place. You might suspect that the town library's not a very fun place to work if its staff is always incredibly cranky every time you visit.</li><li>Staff refers to all of the employees at a business, or especially a school, where the teachers as a group are called ""the staff."" A completely different meaning of staff is a long wooden stick or rod, particularly one that has a specific purpose — like a walking stick or a weapon. This is the original meaning of staff, from the Old English stæf. It wasn't until the nineteenth century that the word staff was used to mean ""group of employees.""</li></ul>"

If you stumble upon a treasure chest, you haven't achieved something; however, achieving a promotion to become CEO is another story.</li><li>If someone asks you to give an example of the word achieve, you can always reach for Shakespeare's much quoted remark from his play Twelfth Night. In Act II, Scene V, the character Malvolio says, "". . . some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em."" Pundits like to throw that quote around when talking about politicians. Of course, they usually disagree about if, when, and how the politician achieved greatness.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0382,"<ul><li>To advise someone is to give them advice, or counsel. If you live in Iceland and a friend visiting you from Hawaii asks what he should pack, advise him to bring warm clothes and snow boots.</li><li>Advise comes from a Latin word for vision. We want people to advise us if we think they can see the whole picture better than we can. For this reason, we often seek the advice of trained people. Financial advisors advise their clients on which funds to invest in. Legal advisors advise their clients on the law. To advise can also be to give notice. You should advise your boss of your decision to quit at least two weeks in advance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0383,"<ul><li>Things that happened already are in the past, as in ""Stop nagging me! I already cleaned my room.""</li><li>If you did something already, you did it in the past, whether an hour ago or a year ago. A team trying for its second championship already won a championship. A kid who ate cake first has already eaten dessert. If you've never done it, then you can't say you already did it. This word often gets used in exasperated tones, as in ""Take out the garbage! I already told you ten times!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0384,"<ul><li>What's basic is what's essential, at the root or base of things. If you've got a basic understanding of differential equations, you can handle simple problems but might get tripped up by more difficult ones.</li><li>You can also speak of the basics. If your kitchen is outfitted with just the basics, you've got some bowls and pots and pans, but you probably don't have an apple corer or a candy thermometer. If you're hitchhiking across the Gobi Desert, you'll want to have the basics of conversational Mongolian down. You've probably heard basic in chemistry class, too: it's the opposite of acidic. A basic solution has a pH greater than 7 and turns litmus paper blue.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0385,"<ul><li>Let me give you a bit of advice: Use bit when you're talking about a small amount.</li><li>Bit is a small but useful word.  Like drill bits, which fit on the end of a drill to change its function, the word bit has several uses.  Usually, it means a little piece of something, even time.   If you ask me when I'm arriving, I might say, ""In a little bit.""   A bit can also be a short theatrical entertainment, the metal piece a horse bites on, or digital information that's 1/8 the size of a byte.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0386,"<ul><li>Consider is a verb that simply means to think about, look at, or judge. Consider, for a moment, the perks of house sitting for your pool-owning neighbors before you immediately refuse their request.</li><li>Coming to us from the Latin word considerare, meaning “to look at closely"" or ""observe,” consider is a very common word that describes something you likely do multiple times a day: You probably consider what to wear in the morning, weigh your options for lunch, take into account the weather when deciding to grab your umbrella. Your life is full of consideration and you didn't even know it!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0387,"<ul><li>When your little brother breaks your carefully constructed Lego village into its tiny parts, he destroys it. To destroy is to completely demolish.</li><li>To destroy is the opposite of to construct or to build. When you destroy something, you cause destruction, when you build something, you are involved in its construction. In war, soldiers are sometimes sent on missions to search and destroy. This means their job is to find a target and completely take it out. Destroy doesn't have to be physical though. If you get an F in your math class, that could destroy your dream of going to an Ivy League university and too much criticism can destroy your self-esteem.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0388,"<ul><li>If you want to entertain, you've got to hold people's attention, usually with something amusing. Clowns, music, silly jokes, and a good game of charades can all be used to entertain.</li><li>Did you know you can actually entertain ideas? It's not quite the same as entertaining friends with a good home cooked meal or tickets to the ball game, but still an appropriate way to use the word. To entertain an idea means to have it in mind or under consideration. For example, you never thought of studying abroad, but after a professor said it was one of the most meaningful experiences of his life, you started to entertain the idea of living in a foreign country.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0389,"<ul><li>Something extra is more than you need or more than you usually have. It's never a bad idea to bake extra chocolate chip cookies.</li><li>Sometimes extra things are good, like the extra money you made this month or the extra attention you get on your birthday. Other times, they're not so great: nobody needs extra problems or extra traffic. Extra can also be an adverb, meaning ""especially"" or ""unusually,"" like when your dog behaves extra well or you plan an extra special party for your friend. Extra comes from extraordinary, from the Latin root extra ordinem, ""outside normal events.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0390,"<ul><li>The goal is the intention of an activity or a plan. In a figurative sense, a goal is the mission of a person or group. A tangible goal could be the net at one end of a soccer field. Your goal is to kick the ball into the net, and then you will have scored a goal.</li><li>Goal used to mean ""the end point of a race."" When you score a goal during a sporting event, the play does momentarily stop. If your goal is to win the presidency and you are in fact elected, you have achieved that goal. A goal is the reason for your efforts. People set goals in all aspects of their lives, not just in scoring points. ""Her goal is to eat 40 cupcakes in one day."" Go figure.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0391,"<ul><li>When you don't tell the truth, you lie. You also lie down when you're sleepy and wonder what lies ahead of you.</li><li>If we leave aside the lie that is an untruth, most meanings of lie are related. If something lies ahead of us, then it's there, down the road, waiting for us. If mountains lie to the east, we can think of them as having settled down there. If something lies unused, it is just sort of left to lie on the shelf (or wherever). If you let a sleeping dog lie, you're just letting him be right where he is — in the same position.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0392,"<ul><li>Use meat to mean any food that comes from the flesh of an animal. Bacon is meat. Cupcakes are not meat.</li><li>You can refer to hamburgers, pork chops, and barbecued ribs as meat. It's okay to call chicken and turkey meat too, although formally it's known as poultry, while the flesh of fish is simply called fish. Sometimes the edible part of a nut is also called meat, although it's 100 percent vegetarian. If your grandmother thinks you're too skinny, she may feed you ""to put some meat on your bones."" In Old English, mete was just ""food.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0393,"<ul><li>An opinion is a belief or attitude about something that isn't necessarily based on facts. It's your opinion that dogs make better pets than cats, but your sister thinks that cats are superior. Too bad your parents' opinion is that pets are too expensive.</li><li>You may have an opinion about a celebrity that I don't share. There's no way to prove who's right and who's wrong. Those are our thoughts about her, and that's the way it is. Ironically, when a judge decides a case, his or her ruling is referred to as an opinion. Even though what the judge says will become a matter of law, it's still just their opinion, based on what was presented by the two sides in a trial.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0394,"<ul><li>Something real is genuine. If you inherit some jewelry, you'll have to take it to an expert to know if those diamonds are real or just cubic zirconia, which looks like a diamond but isn't worth nearly as much.</li><li>That seven footed monster your big brother used to tell you frightening stories about isn't real, and neither, sorry to say, is Santa Claus, because to be real, something has to actually exist. Real has roots in the Latin word res, meaning ""thing."" We also use real to mean ""significant,"" like when we say something is a real problem, or when we say we're really, truly sorry about something. In old Spain or Brazil, a real is a coin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0395,"<ul><li>Something that reflects comes back to you. If you look in a mirror, you will see your reflected image. If you reflect on your past experiences, you look at them once again thoughtfully.</li><li>Reflect also means to give evidence of the character or quality of something. Most parents want their children to reflect their own strengths by emulating their behavior. A set of telling statistics could reflect the buying trends in an economic cycle. Reflecting can mean seeing something original in another form or image.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0396,"<ul><li>When you give someone a good, long look, you regard them. It can also mean ""to believe,"" as in ""I regard her as my best friend.""</li><li>Regard often means respect and admiration, as in ""I have the greatest regard for my grandmother."" Sometimes it's a greeting: you can send someone your regards, which means to tell them you said hello and wish them well. There's a famous song called, ""Give My Regards to Broadway."" On the other hand, you can use it as a sign-off on a letter. Instead of ""Sincerely"" or ""Yours Truly,"" you can close with ""Regards.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0397,"<ul><li>To serve is to perform a role or function. While your co-worker is out sick, you gladly serve as his replacement until he gets better.</li><li>Serve comes from the Latin word for servant or slave, but you can serve people without being subordinate to them. You might serve your family hamburgers for dinner, or serve the tennis ball. If you serve a cause,  you devote yourself to it. Bug repellant will serve you well on a summer fishing trip. In prison you serve time. If you're elected Mayor, you'll serve a term of three or four years.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0398,"<ul><li>A vegetable is an edible part of a plant, like a stalk of broccoli, a carrot, or a spinach leaf. With a few exceptions (think French fries), vegetables are just about the healthiest food you can eat.</li><li>Culinary purists will tell you that some things you think of as vegetables, like tomatoes and zucchinis, aren't vegetables at all — they're fruits, because they have seeds. In general, though, it's fine to refer to the parts of plants used for food as vegetables. The word's original meaning was simply ""any plant,"" and soon it came to mean ""plant cultivated for food."" Since 1921, it's also been slang for ""person leading a monotonous, inactive life.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0399,"<ul><li>War is armed combat between two or more countries or between different groups of people within the same country. As the soul singer Edwin Starr asked, ""War! Huh! What is it good for?"" Absolutely nothing.</li><li>The term ""civil war"" means not that the war is courteous and polite, but that it is between citizens of the same nation or community, as in the American Civil War. Often war refers to nonmilitary combat or tension, such as between angry neighbors, or rival sports teams, or between different social classes — as in ""class war,"" or government policies such as the ""war on drugs.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U20_0400,"<ul><li>The noun worth refers to the monetary value of something. If your grandmother gives you a strange old coin from her collection, you can have it appraised to determine its worth.</li><li>The noun worth also means the inherent value of something based on the qualities of excellence, usefulness or importance. Don't underestimate your worth to the group; the whole bake sale would have fallen apart without you, and your brownies were delicious. As an adjective worth describes something that has a value or deserves to be treated a certain way, like when your hard work baking is worth the effort.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U21_0401,"<ul><li>If something appears, it comes into view. Rub a magic lamp and a genie will appear. If that's the case, she will grant you three wishes.</li><li>Appear comes from the Latin apparere meaning ""to appear, come in sight, make an appearance.""  Whether literally materializing or seeming to be true, the word appear is used to describe something coming into sight or presenting itself. The word can also be used to describe an actor appearing in a play. Julie Andrews appeared in the musical ""Victor Victoria.""  When someone looks happy, he appears to be happy. When a detail seems true, it appears to be true.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U21_0402,"<ul><li>The base of something is usually the foundation, starting point, or main ingredient of something. A soup base is the flavoring or broth you use to get your soup started.</li><li>If you're a soldier, you might live on a base (""place where you're stationed""). When your unit plays softball, you must touch each base before scoring. The bottom of pentagon-shaped home plate is its base (""bottom""). Yelling at or pushing the umpire is considered base (""mean-spirited"") behavior. At end of the season, your team might get a trophy, which sits on a base (""pedestal""), or a plaque made of brass, an alloy of zinc, which is base metal (it corrodes easily).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U21_0403,"<ul><li>The brain is the most complex organ in the body, located inside the protective skull. The word can also be used as a verb in the phrase ""to brain,"" which means to injure or kill someone by hitting them in the head.</li><li>The human brain has inspired many idioms, or colorful phrases. Thinking intently (or obsessively) about something means that you've got it ""on the brain,"" and to ""pick someone's brain"" means to get their ideas on something. A puzzle is a ""brainteaser, someone smart is called ""a brain,"" and the person who runs something is said to be ""the brains"" of the operation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U21_0404,"<ul><li>You may have to take jobs as a dog walker, cat groomer, and fish feeder before you complete school for a career as a veterinarian. Small jobs in the short term give you experience for a long-term career.</li><li>Career comes from the French carrière, from an older word for ""street"" or ""road."" Staying on track for a certain career is like driving a car in one direction on a road, instead of veering in different directions. Maybe the expression ""career path"" is helpful in remembering that a career is something that progresses, or moves forward on a set path.

Though fits into the second category. For example ""Though Prince is considered 'older' by rock-star standards, his concerts put those of most kids half his age to shame."" The ""though"" in that sentence gets its power from the comma at the midpoint, because that's where the two opposing ideas meet. The word Though at the beginning tells us to look for that comma.</li></ul>"

A tiger, for example, is a member of the genus called Panthera, and it's also a member of the cat family.

Makes you wonder why they did so well in one department but not the other. Some argue that standardized tests are no measure of your mental abilities.

4000EEW_B01_U23_0453,"<ul><li>A poem is written by composing lines of metrical feet (those are like beats or counts of syllables), arranged rhythmically. If you're looking to impress your crush, try penning a poem.</li><li>Poetry is literature in metrical form, and a poem is what we call a piece of poetry. There are so many different kinds of poems it's almost impossible to define, but usually poems are written in short lines, and sometimes don't have too many lines. What counts in a poem is distilling something down, and finding the right words. If someone tells you that your Tweets are like little poems, then you must be a lovely writer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U23_0454,"<ul><li>A pole is a rounded stick or rod, usually made of wood, plastic, or metal. You need a pole for hanging a flag, catching fish, or setting up a tent.</li><li>There are many kinds of poles, from the poles skiers use to balance and push themselves forward to the long, flexible pole a pole vaulter uses to help her jump over a high bar. When someone mentions the North or South Pole, they mean the points on either side of the Earth that mark the ends of its axis of rotation. This kind of pole comes from the Latin polus, ""end of an axis"" or ""the heavens.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U23_0455,"<ul><li>You can remove your name from a list, remove a stain from a t-shirt, or remove old furniture from your house. Whatever it is, when you remove something, you take it somewhere else or get rid of it completely.</li><li>The verb remove usually means taking something off or getting rid of something. For example, when you take off your coat, you remove it, or when you remove a skillet from the heat, you take it off the burner. Remove can apply to people: a law-breaking politician who is removed from office. As a noun remove indicates distance, such as being at one remove from your cousin, getting all his news from his mother.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U23_0456,"<ul><li>A safety is a device that helps keep you from doing bad things, like the safety on a gun that prevents you from pulling the trigger accidentally.</li><li>Safety, besides meaning ""the state of being safe,"" is used for things that promote safety. If you designate a special meeting place in case of emergency, that place is a safety. If you use contraception during sex, that's also a safety, to prevent pregnancy. In football it's a safety if a player is tackled behind his own goal line. And if you hit the baseball in a way to ensure you reach the base, that's called a safety too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U23_0457,
4000EEW_B01_U23_0458,"<ul><li>A sound is a noise, something you can hear if you're in the right spot and it's loud enough. A doorbell, a fire alarm, a cat's meow, or your brother's snoring — they’re all sounds.</li><li>Long Island Sound is another kind of sound — it’s a branch of the Atlantic Ocean that runs between Connecticut and Long Island, New York. When you don’t know a word, you might sound out the syllables — say them aloud — to figure out the pronunciation. Sound can also mean ""solid or good."" Sound advice is good advice. Sound investments are secure. When you have a sound sleep, it's restful and uninterrupted — at least until your alarm sounds.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U23_0459,"<ul><li>When you move yourself through the water using your arms and legs, you swim. If you live near the ocean, it's probably a good idea to learn how to swim.</li><li>You might decide to swim across the English Channel, or, if you're a little less adventurous, just swim in your town's swimming pool. When things appear to be submerged as if underwater, they swim too: ""I like it when the mashed potatoes swim in gravy."" And when something appears fuzzy or whirling, it also seems to swim: ""I was so tired the equations on the chalkboard began to swim."" The root of swim means ""to be in motion.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U23_0460,"<ul><li>A web is a sticky pattern of threads woven by a spider, or something similar that appears to be woven together. Your little sister might weave a web of yarn into a potholder.</li><li>Some webs are literally woven — of thread, yarn, ropes, or any other strands of material. Other webs are more figurative, like the web of connections between people who work in the same field or the web of rules and regulations attached to filing your income tax return. There's also the World Wide Web, known as the Internet or just ""the Web,"" named this way because it's a web-like series of interconnected documents and links.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0461,"<ul><li>A block is a painted wooden cube that kids build with, or a squarish chunk of anything, like a block of cheese or cement. And if you block someone, you prevent them from going past by getting in the way.</li><li>A sculptor might carve a bird out of a block of marble, and you might eat a whole block of chocolate after dinner. Another block is the row of buildings or houses between four streets: ""I'm walking the dog around the block."" When block is a verb it means ""to obstruct,"" like when you block your dog from going near the cat food. All these meanings stem from the Old French root bloc, ""block of wood.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0462,"<ul><li>When you dig a hole in the ground, put an object in the hole, and cover it up with dirt, you bury it. Your dog might prefer spending the majority of his time digging holes to bury his toy collection.</li><li>You can bury something to hide it, or it can be part of a funeral ritual to bury a person who's died. You could also predict that the coming snow will bury the city, or you might bury your face in your hands if you were feeling dejected. The root of bury is the Proto-Indo-European word bhergh, ""to protect or preserve."" If you bury your money in the yard, maybe you're trying to protect it from thieves.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0463,"<ul><li>A cheer is what you shout at a sporting event when you cheer your team on, showing your enthusiasm and support. Often there's a lot of cheer or good spirits at these games, unless of course your favorite team loses.</li><li>The word cheer comes from the Old French chiere, meaning ""face.""  When you cheer someone on, you show approval, whether on your face through a smile, or by shouting encouragement.  Cheer is also a quality of being sunny or happy.  You can cheer someone up by being silly or entertaining. Or, you could raise a glass to them and toast, ""Cheers!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0464,"<ul><li>People who are really good at math can handle complex math problems. The rest of us are all set with simple stuff like the times tables. Use complex to refer to something that is not simple.</li><li>Something complex has two or more related parts, or is not simple in its structure. As a noun, a complex is a group of units, often a group of buildings. The adjective is stressed on the second syllable, but the noun is stressed on the first syllable. Complex is from Latin complexus, from complecti ""to encircle or embrace.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0465,"<ul><li>A critic is someone who finds fault with something and expresses an unfavorable opinion. You might be a critic of your school’s new plan to start the school day at 6:30 a.m.</li><li>The word critic came into English by way of Latin, tracing back to the Greek word krinein, meaning “judge, decide.” If you’re a critic, you’re essentially judging something — and finding it lacking. Critic can be used broadly to describe any person expressing an unfavorable view, but there are professional critics as well, such as people who review movies or music. In that sense, the word describes someone who thoughtfully assesses something, either favorably or negatively.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0466,"<ul><li>When you put something together, it's usually best to follow each direction — that is, each step in the instructions for how to do it — so that you put it together correctly. Or, you could just start putting it together, only to discover that you have extra pieces.</li><li>The noun direction has several meanings. It can be an order given, as in, ""Here are your directions: pick up your toys and make the bed!"" Direction can also be something that points out a route as when you ask for directions to the lake. The course leading to a certain point is also a direction so you need to go in a southerly direction for ten miles, and then turn left at the giant chicken sign.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0467,"<ul><li>An event is something that happens, or might happen. In the event that you get stuck in traffic, the wedding will continue. It is too important an event to wait even for someone as important as you.</li><li>When something is eventful, many things happen during it. In a detective story, a protagonist can protect himself by mailing an envelope to the police to be opened ""in the event of his death."" In the novel White Noise, Don DeLillo describes an Airborne Toxic Event, both predicting and mocking the disasters of our time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0468,"<ul><li>Exercise is physical activity, like an exercise class, or the act of practicing anything — like people who exercise caution while crossing the street.</li><li>If your dad tells you to exercise restraint in dealing with your brother who just broke your computer, he hasn't suggested that you tie your brother up — here exercise means ""use"" or ""practice."" This might remind you of the writing exercises your teacher gave you: practice in forming letters. In many kinds of exercise, the results come from doing something over and over — just ask anyone who exercises, or works out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0469,"<ul><li>Friendship is the state of being friends with someone. A good job, good health, and romantic love are important, but without real friendship, your life might not feel full.</li><li>When we talk about friendship, we're often talking about the value of having friends, not just the fact of it. A book might explore the importance of friendship in a young girl's life. You might decide to stop working such long hours and spend more time developing your friendships, in an effort to lead a happier life. A deep friendship can last through many shifts and changes in life, as long as you write or call every now and then.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0470,"<ul><li>A guide is someone who shows you the way. You'd be lucky to have a kind older sibling to act as your guide through middle school, giving you advice and helping you figure out the school and social scenes.</li><li>A guide often leads tourists through a city, taking them to important sites, or assists a group of mountain climbers. Another kind of guide is a book of helpful instructions about what to see in a particular country, how to get along with your teenager, or the best way to grow orchids. When you guide people, you help them find their way, whether it's through the New York subway system or through the steps of building a campfire.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0471,"<ul><li>If you lack something, you need or want something that's missing. When there's a lack of food, people starve.</li><li>There are a lot of things lacking in the world. If you have no video games, then you're lacking them. People who are thirsty and starving lack food and water. Many people lack money and health care. A lack of something is the opposite of an abundance of something. If you have plenty of books, then you don't lack them — though you may lack enough time to read them all.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0472,"<ul><li>To perform most often means to sing, dance act or put on any kind of show. Perform also means, however, to carry out almost any function or action — to do something, in other words.</li><li>Parents love to watch their kids perform. Nothing delights mommy or daddy more than watching junior sing or dance in the school play. Later in life, though, they'll be happy when their kids perform acts of kindness or when they perform the duties required of them by their jobs. ""The surgeon entertained the other doctors when he performed an aria from Rigoletto while he performed an appendectomy."" Now that's impressive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0473,"<ul><li>You feel pressure when something presses on you –- whether a physical force or a stressful situation.  If you don't crack under the pressure of witnessing the accident, you will calmly apply pressure on the driver's wound until help arrives.</li><li>The pressure of a looming deadline might cause you to finally get to work on an assignment.  Pressure can also be a verb, like when your friend pressures you  to go rock climbing despite your fear of heights.  The rocks you would rather not climb were formed long ago by extreme heat and pressure.  While climbing, your friend's blood pressure may rise right along with yours when she sees how clumsy you are.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0474,"<ul><li>If something probably will happen, it's likely. If it probably won't happen, don't get your hopes up.</li><li>This is a word for things that are likely to happen or just believable. If your dinner is gone and your dog looks guilty, the dog probably jumped on the table to eat it. If someone moved all the furniture around while you were sleeping, you probably would have noticed. Given all the billions of stars in the sky, there's probably life out there, but who knows if we'll ever meet it. You probably like some foods better than others.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0475,"<ul><li>Something that affects the entire community — whether it's your town, your country, or the world — is public. Climate change, for example, is a public concern, as is finding a clean public bathroom.</li><li>You can use the word public as a noun, when you're talking about a large group of people. You might say that the public is getting tired of the inefficient bus system in your city, or that the new library branch is open to the public. The adjective public is good for discussing things that concern everyone. The Latin root word, publicus, means ""of the people, of the state, common, or ordinary.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0476,"<ul><li>Although smart is most often used to describe someone who is intelligent, you can also call someone a smart, chic dresser or a smart, sassy wisecracker.</li><li>Smart often implies something good, but not always.  If someone cautions you, ""Don't be smart with me!"" — they are demanding that you stop acting so bold and rude. As a verb, if something smarts, then it hurts. If your knee smarts, then you probably whacked it. However, if someone says that you are a smart dresser or a smart thinker, you can take those comments as compliments.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0477,"<ul><li>At its most basic, strike means to hit. If you strike someone, you hit them with your hand or a weapon. If lightning strikes, it makes contact. If you strike out on a trip, you're ""hitting"" the road. If you strike gold, you've ""struck it rich""!</li><li>Strike can also mean not to hit, as in miss –– as in ""three strikes and you're out."" That meaning might have evolved from strike meaning to cross off, as in ""If you don't come to practice, coach will strike your name from the starting lineup."" It might also have led to the idea of a labor strike. If employees want to protest their work conditions, they go on strike, or refuse to work until conditions improve.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0478,"<ul><li>The verb support means to bear weight or load, or otherwise support. If you build a house with blocks, you can safely remove some of them, but if you remove one that is supporting the weight of the blocks above it, the whole structure can collapse. Timber!</li><li>If you agree with or approve of a cause, person, idea, or the like, you support it. If you support a certain charity, you may donate your time or money to the cause. The verb support also means to strengthen with new evidence; to corroborate. When politicians make an argument, they support it by providing ""facts and figures."" Your job is to figure out whether their evidence has been twisted to support their positions. Good luck.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0479,"<ul><li>A term is a word or expression used with a particular meaning. ""Rap,"" ""punk,"" ""grunge,"" and ""heavy metal"" are terms that describe particular styles of music. ""Sweetie"" is a term of endearment, at least to most people.</li><li>Terms can also mean the conditions of an agreement: when you rent an apartment, you agree to certain terms — that you'll pay the rent, you won't have loud parties, etc. If you're ""on good terms with someone,"" you like each other. Term can also be a defined period of time. Spring term at school is the spring semester, and you may be assigned a term paper — to demonstrate how brilliant you've become during that time period.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U24_0480,"<ul><li>Use the verb unite to describe two or more things merging into one, like several angry citizens who unite to form a political group.</li><li>If two countries come together to form one country, they unite. This happened in 1990 when East Germany and West Germany merged into one united Germany. If several people act as one, joining for a common goal, they also unite. The word has been used in English since the fifteenth century, and it came from the Latin unitus, ""to unite,"" which in turn has its roots in unus, which means ""one.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0481,"<ul><li>As a verb, associate can mean to make a connection between things or concepts. You might associate the smell of lemons with summer memories of selling lemonade. Or, with polishing your furniture with Lemon Pledge.</li><li>As a noun, in employment, an associate is someone who is in a junior position. You might hear about associates at law firms, hoping to make partner one day. However, some companies also use associate to mean any employee, regardless of rank or seniority. The noun associate can also mean a friend or someone you keep company with. And, as a verb, associate can also mean to keep company with — like when you were associating with activists at the protest march.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0482,"<ul><li>Think of the environment as everything that is around you. A quiet room with good lighting and no distractions is a good environment for doing homework, or at least that's what your parents and teachers think.</li><li>Environment generally refers to your surroundings. If something is good for the environment, it is beneficial to the complex system of plant and animal life, water and air on Earth. An environment need not be so large, however. The environment of your living room means the tables, chairs and decor that are in the room. Sometimes it refers to the general attitude of a place. Do you thrive in a competitive environment or prefer an atmosphere of cooperation?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0483,"<ul><li>A factory is a big building in which products are made, like Willie Wonka's fictional Chocolate Factory, which was famous for producing (among other sweets and treats) the one-of-a-kind Everlasting Gobstopper.</li><li>Early relatives of the word factory were in use as far back as the 1500s, long before the Industrial Revolution made the modern idea of a factory a reality. Of course, a big building with many different types of machinery inside it isn't the only definition of a factory. A successful pop group that scores several number one songs in a row could be called ""a hit factory.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0484,"<ul><li>A feature is a part of something that makes it special or able to work better, such as a bonus feature on a DVD or a smartphone feature that provides faster Internet connections.</li><li>The word feature has both a noun and a verb form used to describe a main characteristic, as in a car's safety features or a restaurant menu that features Italian dishes. In addition, feature can refer to a newspaper or magazine article that provides in-depth information, like a feature about the First Lady and her life. You’ve probably also heard it used to describe a main part of the face, such as the eyes, nose, or mouth.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0485,"<ul><li>An instance is a specific example or case of something. One instance of being chased by a growling dog can make a person spend his whole life being afraid of animals.</li><li>It's common to find instance used in the expression ""for instance,"" meaning ""for example."" Bright colors — for instance, pink, green, and blue — can cheer you up when you're feeling sad. Instance can also mean ""occurrence."" Several instances of cheating might be reported after a math test, for example. In the sixteenth century, the Medieval Latin word instantia meant ""example to the contrary,"" leading to an early definition of instance as ""single objection.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0486,"<ul><li>To involve means to connect. When you get involved in the Spanish Club, you attend meetings and events. If doing math well is involved in understanding advanced chemistry, that means it's a necessary part of it.</li><li>When someone is very involved, it means they are engaged or connected to a lot of activities. When someone is self-involved, all they connect with is him or herself. If getting ice cream involves walking a mile to the ice cream shop, the exercise offsets the indulgence. When no exercise is involved, it's less healthy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0487,"<ul><li>Medicine is the field (and body of knowledge) that teaches doctors how to help people. Doctors also give medicine to patients.</li><li>Cough syrup, antibiotics, and pills are all forms of medicine. When someone gives you medicine, they are medicating you. People who study medicine become doctors and nurses. Without the field of medicine — which expands all the time — there would be so much more sickness and death. Medicine is devoted to finding out everything about health, illness, and the human body.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0488,"<ul><li>To mix is to combine or blend different things together. If you mix baking soda and vinegar, you can create an erupting volcano for your science project.</li><li>Scientists mix chemical substances; bakers mix flour, eggs, milk, and sugar; and songwriters mix different musical elements — in each of these cases, the result is also a mix, a combination of different things into a new whole. The word mix comes from the Middle English adjective mixte, ""composed of more than one element,"" which is rooted in the Latin miscere, ""to mix or blend,"" and also ""to throw into confusion.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0489,"<ul><li>If you systematically put something in order, you organize it. Your family might not understand the way you organize your kitchen if you keep shoelaces, dental floss, and a screwdriver in your silverware drawer.</li><li>The verb organize also means to plan or orchestrate something. If you've agreed to organize the German club's bake sale, you'll probably spend some serious time transporting cupcakes and linzer torte to school. When a group of workers forms a union, this action is also described with the verb organize. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union, for example, was organized in 1900 in New York City by immigrant factory workers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0490,"<ul><li>A period is all about defining when something begins and ends. Class periods usually last about forty-five minutes. Following the last food fight, there was a period of relative peace in the school.</li><li>You know that dot at the end of a sentence? That's a period too. It means the sentence is over. In sports, games are often divided into playing periods: an ice hockey game, for example, has three periods. If you're a dinosaur buff, you know that this word can also refer to expanses of geologic time. The stegosaurus lived during the Jurassic period, for example, while the Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops lived during the Cretaceous period.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0491,"<ul><li>When people live in or occupy a country, city, or town, they populate it. It doesn’t always refer to people — bugs might populate your kitchen if you leave half-eaten food out.</li><li>If your family lives alone on an island, you're the only people who populate it. You can also use this verb to mean ""be present in,"" so you might say that vampires populate your favorite books, or that animated characters populate most of the movies you watch. Populate also means ""fill in"" in computing: ""Will you populate that spreadsheet with data?"" The Latin populus, or ""people,"" is at the root of populate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0492,"<ul><li>To produce is to create, manufacture, or cultivate. We rely on agriculture to produce food and artists to produce art.</li><li>As a noun, produce (accented first syllable) is the product of gardening: fruits and vegetables. The verb form of this word (accented last syllable) has several meanings, all related to making, creating, bringing forth, or raising. At the airport, you might be asked to produce (show) some identification. To produce results is to get a job done or to have something to show for your work. To produce children is to give birth to them or raise them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0493,"<ul><li>The word range refers to a variety of things or to an area in which something operates. The store offers the living room set in a range of colors. What's the range of that remote-controlled airplane?</li><li>As a noun, range can also be used to describe a set of mountains such as the Sierra Nevada or it can mean a grassy plain where cattle graze. As a verb, use range to mean a span or variety of things. Your family conversation at the dinner table probably ranges over a variety of topics. At school, you learn about many subjects ranging from English literature to calculus to European history.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0494,"<ul><li>When, at a meeting, you wave your hand wildly, you want to be recognized.  When the chairperson finally says, “I recognize the man who is about to fall out of his seat,” don't forget what you wanted to say.</li><li>The verb recognize comes from the Latin root words re (again) and cognoscere (to know) – literally “to know again” or “to identify.”  If your own identical twin doesn't recognize you, you might be wearing too much makeup.  Recognize can also mean “to acknowledge” or “to appreciate.”  When you recognize the donors for their generous contributions to your fundraising event, your parents say, “You're welcome.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0495,"<ul><li>The adjective regular is useful for describing something that happens in a specific way again and again, like your regular tasks at work.</li><li>Things that occur in a particular order or a certain way can be called regular. You might have a regular group of patients you visit when you're volunteering at the hospital, or a roommate who insists on sitting down together for regular meals. The word regular comes from the Latin regularis, ""continuing rules for guidance,"" which in turn has its roots in regula, or ""rule.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0496,"<ul><li>A sign is a clue something happened, or a display that communicates a message, like a stop sign that tells you stop. To sign also means to write your signature.</li><li>The word sign has many senses, but in a general, it usually has something to say. It may be a symptom that tells about a problem, or it may just be a symbol, like the plus and minus signs in math. Sign language uses hand signals to represent words and letters. And if thunder rumbles whenever you open that book, you may take it as a sign not to read it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0497,"<ul><li>The pointed or tapered end of something is its tip. There's the tip of your dog's wagging tail, the tips of your fingers, or the tip of the continent of South America.</li><li>When you can almost remember someone's name, you might say it's on the tip of your tongue, and when something's just ""the tip of the iceberg,"" it's only one small bit of a much larger problem. Other meanings of tip include ""tilt,"" like when you tip your hat as you stroll down the street, and ""gratuity,"" or the extra money you give a waiter or barber in exchange for good service.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0498,"<ul><li>Traditions are longstanding customs and practices. It might be a family tradition to open Christmas presents on Christmas Eve, started because your parents were too impatient to wait.</li><li>The noun tradition has Latin roots in the word tradere, which means hand over or hand down. So think of a tradition as something that is handed down from one generation to another. Fireworks on the Fourth of July are a national tradition, and playing your school's fight song at the start of the football game is probably a longstanding tradition designed to get the fans excited for the game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0499,"<ul><li>Trash is rubbish or garbage — it's the stuff that gets thrown away. Your town might organize a clean-up day each year when people pick up trash in parks and neighborhoods.</li><li>Trash is dirty, worthless, leftover debris. Fittingly, the word is also a terribly derogatory term for useless, low-status people: ""I should've known you were nothing but trash."" And to trash talk is to brutally criticize or gossip about someone. You can even use trash as a verb, to mean ""throw away,"" as in, ""I'm going to trash this trash in that trash can over there.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U25_0500,
4000EEW_B01_U26_0501,"<ul><li>Advice is a suggestion about what to do. If you just can't decide between the pecan pie and the chocolate torte, ask the waiter for his advice.</li><li>Advice comes from old French words for seeing, or view. It first meant opinion, but came to mean an opinion about what to do. If you become President, you'll gather a cabinet to give you their advice. If your doctor tells you to eat better, exercise more, and take up swimming, that's her medical advice.  Someone gives you their advice, never ""an advice."" You can, however, ask for a ""piece of advice.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0502,"<ul><li>Along means ""moving constantly in line with."" When you walk along the road, you're going forward, keeping the road at your side.</li><li>You can move along a path or drive along a highway, and you can also figuratively move along: ""I learned a lot along the way."" Something that extends in a nearly horizontal line can also be described as along, like the seaweed that stretches along the high-tide line on the beach. In Old English, it was andlang, ""entire, continuous,"" ""all day long,"" or ""alongside of.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0503,"<ul><li>""May I have your attention please?"" When you ask that question, you are asking people to focus their mental powers on you. Whether they do or not depends on your next words. You'll have their full attention if you say, ""Here's $100.""</li><li>The noun attention can also refer to an interest in something or someone. You probably pay attention in school when your teachers bring up topics in which you are personally interested. You can also shower attention on those you love or indulge. The word also refers to ""standing at attention,"" as in the military — by standing up straight, arms down at the sides, and feet together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0504,"<ul><li>To attract is to exert a force that draws something in, like the way a magnet attracts a paper clip. You might know the phrase, ""opposites attract."" This means you might be drawn to a personality type that is completely unlike yours.</li><li>With attract comes the sense that the pull you feel towards someone or something is not entirely voluntary. It's quite possible to say that you are attracted to someone, but you don't really like them. Low prices can attract buyers into a store they would not normally go into, and standing on a street corner screaming loudly will probably attract quite a bit of attention, but not the good kind.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0505,"<ul><li>To climb is to go higher. When you ascend a mountain, you climb it, and when a song rises in popularity, it climbs the charts.</li><li>To climb something generally takes hard work, which is clear when you watch a toddler climb a jungle gym or a mountaineer climb a sheer rock wall. You can also climb things metaphorically, like when a soldier climbs the ranks from corporal to major. Prices can climb too, when they get higher, and you can climb a social ladder when you meet well-connected people at parties. The Germanic root is klimban, ""go up by clinging.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0506,"<ul><li>When you drop something, you let go of it and it falls. To drop a football is every receiver's nightmare. If you decide to drop your girlfriend or boyfriend, it will be their nightmare.</li><li>You might drop your dog's leash so she can sprint across the beach, or drop the heavy bags you've been carrying as soon as you walk in your front door. You can also drop to the ground yourself, to avoid being hit by your brother's remote control airplane. A drop is a fall, plummet, or plunge — literal, or figurative: ""A drop in profits means we'll have to lay off some workers.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0507,"<ul><li>Use the word final when something is over and done with. If you pester your parents too much, they may say, ""You aren't going out and that's final!"" End of discussion.</li><li>What is the last thing you do at school? You take final exams. Before leaving for a trip? You do a final check of your suitcase to make sure you have everything you need. Then you know you're finished packing. Both final and finish come from the Latin word finis, meaning ""end."" Now you know why some European movies show fin instead of the end before the credits roll.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0508,"<ul><li>If you ask your parents for money, they might say they need to think about it further and then ask you lots of questions. Further refers to figurative distance, like a thought you need more time on.</li><li>Further often gets confused with farther, but it's better to use further to mean an abstract distance, when two things are moving apart in terms of ideals, agreement, or thoughts, and farther when you're talking about physical distance. There's also a verb form of further that means ""to promote the growth or progress of,"" which you might use in a sentence like, ""These new gigs should help her further her career as a rock musician.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0509,"<ul><li>Imply means to express, suggest, or show something without stating it directly: A friend’s gruff manner would imply that she’s in a foul mood.</li><li>The verb imply comes from a Latin word meaning “enfold or entangle” but has come to mean “to hint at.” You might imply something that you don’t want to outright say if you’re feeling coy. If you don’t call someone back after she leaves eight messages, you imply that you don’t want to chat. When you make a subtle suggestion, you imply.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0510,"<ul><li>Maintain means to keep the same––keep steady, keep up, or keep going. Sure, you can ride your bike super fast on a flat surface, but it can be hard to maintain that speed, or keep the same speed, going up a hill.</li><li>When you maintain a strict study schedule, you stick to it. When you maintain your car in good working order, you take good care of it. If you maintain records of your business activity, it means you make notes of your sales and expenses. If a teacher maintains order in the classroom, she never lets disruptions get out of hand. If you maintain your family, you keep them in food, shelter and clothing. If you maintain that eating animals is cruel, you keep that position.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0511,"<ul><li>When offered a choice between two things you don't like, you might choose neither. 
Whereas ""either"" means you would pick one, neither closes the door on both, saying you do ""not"" choose ""either"" one.</li><li>The adjective neither comes directly from Middle English, evolving from the word nawther. Neither is versatile, and can be used as a pronoun, (""Neither of your ideas works""), or an adjective (""Neither plan can be used""). It can also be used as a conjunction, in which case it is usually paired with ""nor"" (""We can use neither your first suggestion nor your second one"").  Sounds like you're having a tough day.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0512,
4000EEW_B01_U26_0513,"<ul><li>When something is physical it's really there. You can see it, touch it, taste it, hear it, or smell it. The physical world is all of the stuff around you.</li><li>When your doctor performs a physical, he or she is checking out your physical self. They're probably going to take your temperature, draw blood and listen to your heart and lungs. You may be asked a mental health question or two, but they're not going to ask you how you feel about God or what the meaning of life is. In physical education, you do physical activity. You move your body to make it healthier.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0514,"<ul><li>When you prove something, you show that it's true. If you say you love eating raw eggs, you may have to prove it by chugging a few. When someone asks you to prove something, you need evidence, also known as proof.</li><li>Prove comes from the Latin root probare, ""to test or prove worthy."" The word’s meaning is clear in this quote from writer Ernest Holmes: ""There was a time when a man was so convinced that the world was round that he was determined to prove it."" As a transitive verb, prove requires an object to receive the action, as in ""How can you prove your claim?"" It can also be intransitive, as in ""You might prove to be right.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0515,"<ul><li>When you react to something, you respond to it. If someone pokes you in class, you might react by sticking out your tongue at them. The teacher might then react by giving you both detention.</li><li>If someone says to you, ""act, don't react,"" they are telling you not to automatically respond to something that someone does. Instead, you should think about it first and then decide what you want to do. In science, the word react is used to describe what happens when two substances combine and cause a chemical change in each other. When you add baking soda to vinegar, the chemicals in each react and create a foamy lava like substance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0516,"<ul><li>To ride is to be carried in a car, on a bike, or on an animal. When you ride a horse for the first time, it's often surprising how far off the ground you are.</li><li>You can ride in the back of a taxi or on a Ferris wheel at the fair. You can also ride — and control — a pony or a bicycle. As a noun, ride means ""a trip in a vehicle,"" or a roller coaster or other amusement park entertainment. In the U.S., ride has also been an informal name for a car since about 1930: ""Check out my new ride!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0517,
4000EEW_B01_U26_0518,"<ul><li>The noun society refers to people living in social order. Unless you are a reclusive person, you are a part of society in some way or another.</li><li>Society can also refer to fashionable elite, the ""beau monde"" or ""smart set."" An organization or club formed around a common interest is sometimes also called a society. To add to its mystique, this type of society might create special rules, greetings, or handshakes. Certain national societies that may have branches in your community include the Elks Lodge or the National Association of Professional Women.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0519,"<ul><li>A standard is an ideal or set of criteria that you use to judge things against. Colleges have certain standards for applicants, like a minimum SAT score or an above average grade point average.</li><li>If you complain that the soup isn't up to your standard, you're comparing it to an ideal and finding it lacking. (Just don't be surprised if the chef then ""accidentally"" spills it in your lap.) The economy used to work by the gold standard, where one dollar equaled a fixed amount of gold. A standard can also be a military flag or banner on a pole. Or a popular old song that's considered a classic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U26_0520,"<ul><li>To suggest is to propose or hint. If you suggest going out for ice cream, nobody's going to object. If you suggest that your sister should get the frozen yogurt instead, she might think you are suggesting something about her weight.</li><li>The verb suggest is also used when people speak about scientific research. Experimental results are often used to suggest whether a theory might be correct. For example, if a patient takes a new drug and starts feeling better, that will suggest the drug is working. Suggest can also mean to drop a hint. If you find a polite way to suggest that the pot roast is inedible, you don't come out and declare it directly. You wouldn't want to hurt Mom's feelings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0521,"<ul><li>You might think your mom would be thrilled to open a birthday present and find a live rabbit, but actually that's the last thing she's hoping for. Actually is an adverb that means ""really.""</li><li>Actually can be used two ways: first, as an adverb meaning ""really."" You might say, ""It's hard to know which of these cookies will taste best without actually sampling them all."" The other way to use the word actually is to imply that your expectations have been proven wrong, that the opposite of what you thought is true. You could say, ""The hotel room looked spotless, but actually it turned out to have bedbugs.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0522,
4000EEW_B01_U27_0523,"<ul><li>The noun coast describes the area where the land meets the sea — the seashore. When your mom says, ""We're going to the coast,"" pack your bathing suit, because you'll be near the ocean.</li><li>Coast also has a verb form that describes an effortless movement, like when you're riding your bike down a hill and you don't have to pedal at all. It can also be used figuratively to describe something that's gained without much difficulty. You might coast to victory in the playoffs when your team wins 8-0 and is never threatened.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0524,"<ul><li>""Let's make a deal,"" a friend might say to you. That means he wants to make an agreement on something. If you pay for the gas, for example, he'll pay for the food. What a deal!</li><li>Ready to deal with all the meanings of the word deal?! You can deal a deck of cards. You can make a business deal. You can strike a deal. You can try to deal with an unfortunate situation. You can score a deal in the bargain basement. Deal comes from the Old English dǣlan, meaning ""divide"" and ""participate.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0525,"<ul><li>A desert is a very dry area of land where few plants and animals can live. If you find yourself stranded in the middle of the desert, you'll have no company except for the occasional lizard or scorpion.</li><li>Desert comes from the Latin desertus, for abandoned or lying in waste. This can refer to a vast sandy area without vegetation, or any empty, lifeless expanse. As a verb, it means to leave someone or something. A soldier who runs away from the army is called a deserter. Occasionally you'll hear someone say, ""He got his just deserts,"" which doesn't have anything to do with abandonment; it means he got what he deserved.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0526,"<ul><li>If your email outlining a plan to reduce office paper waste resulted in a 20 percent reduction in paper use, that means your plan was effective: it did what you wanted it to do.</li><li>The adjective effective has many shades of meaning, but you'll usually see it describing something that's able to produce a desired goal. Effective traces back to the Latin word effectivus, from efficere, meaning “work out, accomplish,” and that meaning still holds true. Something effective gets the job done. As President, hopefully your policies are effective. We also use effective for something real and in effect, like the effective price of gas, or your effective grounding.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0527,"<ul><li>The verb examine means to study something carefully and in great detail. You can examine a book, a painting, a person’s face and so on. Right now, you are examining the meaning of examine.</li><li>Examine means to look at something very closely and usually with the purpose of making a judgment. If you go to see a doctor, the doctor will examine you to see if you are healthy. Examine can also mean “question.” When the police examine a witness, they are questioning that witness. Along these same lines, examine can also be used to mean “test.” You might examine, or test, your friend’s knowledge of biology by asking him repeated questions about that subject.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0528,"<ul><li>Something that's false is wrong or untrue. If you spread false rumors about a friend, you're telling lies.</li><li>When you read a fact in a textbook that you know is mistaken, you can describe it as false. Giving someone a false impression about your family's pizza place — implying that it's a fancy restaurant when it's really a take-out counter and a pizza oven — means you're giving the wrong idea. False can also mean ""fake,"" as in false eyelashes or a false smile. It comes from the Old French fals, which is faux in Modern French: ""false,fake, incorrect, or mistaken.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0529,"<ul><li>To figure out is to investigate or think something through in order to understand it. You might figure out through a little online sleuthing that your kindergarten teacher moved to Alaska and became a salmon fisherman.</li><li>You can figure out the answer to a tricky math problem using a calculator, and you can figure out how old you were when you visited Disney World by looking at photographs and consulting your parents. This informal phrase comes in handy whether you're finding the solution for a big problem or simply puzzling out something small, like when you figure out which kind of treat your dog likes best.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0530,"<ul><li>A gift is an item that's given without any expectation of payment — it's a present. A gift may be the present you receive on your birthday or it may be a natural gift or talent you possess — like your gift for reading lips.</li><li>People give gifts to mark special occasions, like birthdays, weddings, anniversaries. and some holidays. Sometimes tourists buy gifts while on vacation and bring them home to their friends and family. Another kind of gift is a special ability: ""She has such a gift for learning languages."" The root of gift is probably the Old Norse gipt or gift, which means both ""gift"" and ""good luck.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0531,"<ul><li>Hunger is the sensation of needing — or wanting — to eat something. People use the same word to describe a hankering for a snack or for the more dire meaning of starvation, as in ""world hunger.""</li><li>Hunger sometimes refers to an extreme lack of food, the equivalent to starvation: ""We need to do something about hunger in poor communities."" It can also simply mean your afternoon craving: ""My daily hunger for chocolate was distracting me from my work."" You can also hunger for things, both food (like when you hunger for French fries) and non-food things (like when you hunger for attention).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0532,"<ul><li>To imagine something is to picture it in your head. When we imagine things, we're using our imagination.</li><li>The word image is a good clue to the meaning of imagine, a word for picturing or envisioning things. You could imagine you're a king, an astronaut, a firefighter, or a coyote. You could imagine the earth getting hit by an asteroid. If you can think of it, you can imagine it. Sometimes, imagining means believing or guessing. For example, your teacher could say, ""Did you really imagine there would be no homework?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0533,"<ul><li>If you're looking for a more refined word to call your latest drive to the beach or trip to the mall, try journey — a noun that describes travel from one place to another.</li><li>From the Old French journée, meaning a “day’s work or travel,” journey doubles as both noun and verb. The noun simply refers to a voyage; the verb is the act of taking that voyage. So you can journey across the Sahara, or tell friends about your journey across the desert if you make it back alive. Either way, you should always remember that life is a journey, not a destination.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0534,"<ul><li>To puzzle over something is to try to understand or solve it. Picture someone struggling with a jigsaw puzzle, trying to figure out how all those tiny pieces fit together to form an image. That person is puzzling over a puzzle!</li><li>When something puzzles you, it confuses and mystifies you. New technology might continually puzzle your grandfather, while your grandmother is quick to figure it out. When you puzzle over a difficult book or the instructions to your new TV, it's like you're trying to piece together a tricky puzzle — a challenging game or problem. The classic puzzle is a jigsaw puzzle, a picture that's split into small, oddly-shaped pieces you need to reassemble into a whole. There are also logic puzzles, crossword puzzles, and mechanical puzzles like a Rubik's Cube. If you can't figure a person out, you can also call them a puzzle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0535,"<ul><li>Quite means ""really,"" ""completely,"" ""rather,"" ""exceptionally,"" or ""actually."" That's quite a lot of synonyms for one word!</li><li>If you're quite sure, you're completely sure. If you're quite the athlete, you are exceptionally (or unusually) athletic. If it's quite cold outside, it's really cold. And if something is quite true, it actually is. Is that quite clear?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0536,"<ul><li>Use rather to specify a preference for one thing over another. Wouldn't you rather go to the movies than stay home and clean the house?</li><li>Rather can also be used to mean ""on the contrary,"" or to introduce a contradiction. You didn't believe in ghosts — rather thinking there was a scientific explanation for any ghostly appearances — until you saw a ghost yourself. The adverb rather also means ""to a certain degree."" You might grudgingly admit that your mom's strange-sounding chocolate-avocado pudding was actually rather tasty.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0537,"<ul><li>If you describe something as specific, you're signaling that you're being precise.  Say you ask your friend to meet you at a specific time and place — it means you want to meet her at, say, Ray's Pizza at 3:00 PM, not just anywhere.</li><li>Specific also means ""detailed and exact.""  That's the sense of the word that comes into play when a teacher advises you to be as specific as possible.  Indeed, specific writing paints a picture.  Say your friend Angela lives on a soybean farm in Iowa and takes Claritin for her pollen allergy.  That might not be the most interesting fact in the world, but it's a lot more interesting than saying you have a friend who lives in the Midwest and takes medicine for a problem.  If the sentence about Angela's pollen allergy is interesting at all, it's because of the specifics.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0538,"<ul><li>A spider is a small, eight-legged animal. Some people scream when they see a spider, but most of the time spiders won’t hurt you.</li><li>You might think of spiders as falling into the category of ""bugs,"" but they're not insects at all—spiders, like ticks and scorpions, are arachnids. Most spiders are harmless to people and helpful in controlling insect populations. Spiders feed on bugs that get caught in their sticky webs. The Germanic root of spider means ""spinner."" If you are terrified of spiders, you may suffer from arachnophobia, from the Latin arachnid, ""spider,"" and phobia, ""fear.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0539,"<ul><li>Use the noun tour to describe a route taken while sight-seeing or the act of experiencing a place, like a tour of Italy in which travelers tour museums and churches.</li><li>Not all tours have to do with vacations. In fact, a tour can be quite the opposite, such as a snowplow driver whose tour during a blizzard lasts until the streets are clear, or military personnel who serve a tour of duty in the place they are assigned. These kinds of tours involve a commitment of work or service for a certain period of time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U27_0540,"<ul><li>When you trip, you stumble or lose your footing. As a noun, a trip is a journey or outing, like your trip to the library yesterday or your trip to Japan last summer.</li><li>You can trip over a bump in the sidewalk, and you can also trip another person, or make them stumble (although it's not very nice to do so on purpose). The 14th-century meaning of the verb was ""tread lightly and nimbly, dance, or caper."" Experts aren't quite sure how trip got from that to ""awkwardly stumble.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0541,"<ul><li>A band is a narrow strip of fabric or some other material, like the head band a little girl wears in her hair. When a patient is admitted to a hospital, she gets a plastic wrist band with her name on it.</li><li>There are many different kinds of bands, from rubber bands to wedding bands — what they have in common is being thin and flat, and forming a kind of loop or circle. Other ways to use the word band include to mean musicians who play together or another group with something in common, like a band of thieves. When you band together with others, you join them in a clump or support a common cause.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0542,"<ul><li>Something barely there is hardly there at all. If there are barely any leaves on the trees, then winter is right around the corner.</li><li>Barely is a word meaning hardly, nearly, scarcely, or marginally. If there is barely a dusting of snow, there is hardly any snow at all. If your team barely won a game, then they came really close to losing. If you barely missed an ice cream truck, then you missed it by seconds. This is a word for near misses and close calls.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0543,"<ul><li>As an adjective boring describes something (or someone) that is tedious, dull, and lacking in interest. As a noun, boring refers to the act of drilling a hole, or the hole itself.</li><li>When a geologist's powerful drill makes a boring into the earth, you can remove a sample and learn about the history of our planet just by seeing what's contained in the boring's layers. Of course, if you aren't interested in that kind of thing, you might find a two-hour lecture on the subject a bit boring.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0544,"<ul><li>To cancel means to call off or postpone indefinitely. Which is probably what you would do if the hotel you were planning to stay in has an infestation of bedbugs.</li><li>Scrub, scratch, or strike down — those are all other ways of saying cancel. People often cancel plans, deciding not to do something they had already scheduled. In math, if the numerator and a denominator of a fraction have common factors you can cancel the factors out, which means delete them. To cancel a debt means to get rid of it. A cancel on a postage stamp is the mark that shows it has been used.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0545,"<ul><li>A driveway is a small private road in front of a house or garage. If there's no parking allowed on your street, you can tell visiting friends to park their cars in your driveway.</li><li>Some driveways are only a few feet long, while others stretch for many yards to houses set far back from the public road. Homeowners are responsible for their driveways, including plowing or shoveling the snow that falls in the driveway during the winter months. You can also call your driveway a drive, and both words emerged in the late 19th century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0546,"<ul><li>If you throw it in the trash, you can call it garbage. Likewise, if something is so terrible you wish you could throw it in the trash, like a really bad movie, you can also call it garbage.</li><li>Everything in your kitchen trash is garbage — essentially, it's anything that's useless. Garbage can include vegetable scraps, wadded-up paper, or even spoken gibberish. The origin of the word garbage is a little uncertain, though in the 15th century it was used to mean literally ""giblets of a fowl,"" or the extra parts that weren't considered food.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0547,"<ul><li>An instrument is usually a tool for making music, like a piano or a guitar, but it can also be used for almost any kind of tool or thing you use to get something done.</li><li>A thermometer is an instrument for measuring temperature. A violin is an instrument used for making music. Recent economic woes were blamed on the abuse of certain financial instruments, which is just a fancy way of saying ""deals."" Your eye is a very sensitive light-collecting instrument, though you'll need a man-made instrument, like an X-ray telescope, if you want to see light outside of the visible spectrum.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0548,"<ul><li>To make a list is to put things in order or to name them, like a grocery list or a wish list. Listing is also leaning over, creating a slant called a list.</li><li>List can also be a verb used to describe what you do when you make a list. You could list all the state capitals, people's names, your favorite movies, or pretty much anything. Listing can be done numerically, alphabetically, or randomly. Also, a line or surface that leans or tilts has a list, like a sagging bookcase that's overloaded. To lean in this way is to list: the Leaning Tower of Pisa is listing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0549,"<ul><li>Magic describes those unlikely events that seem to have a supernatural force behind them. When the elevator doors open just as you approach, it may seem like magic.</li><li>If you believe in witches and sorcerers, you probably already know that they can use magic to make impossible things happen. Magic is often used more broadly to describe things that just seem to involve some greater power. The waiter may appear as if by magic just when you’re craving dessert. Magic can also describe seemingly impossible tricks performed by an entertainer — a magician — such as making a person disappear or pulling a coin out of thin air.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0550,"<ul><li>A message is a communication or statement conveyed from one person or group to another. If you call my house phone and I’m out running an errand, you’ll be asked to “please leave a message after the beep.”</li><li>Generally transmitted verbally or in writing, a message can also be sent via a look or a gesture. In today’s world, people tend to use email to send a short message. But in ye olden days, pre-internet and when the post was faster, people relied on the art of letter writing to send a message. The noun can also have a moral or pointed implication. For instance, the story's moral message was to always tell the truth.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U28_0551,"<ul><li>The word notice has to do with paying attention to something. For example, you usually notice a flashing light, and an overdue bill might come with the word ""NOTICE"" written on it to make sure you see it.</li><li>The Latin nōtitia, a noun meaning ""something known,"" was the ancestor of notice.  Use the verb to mean “to see or point out"" and the noun to mean ""formal warning.""  When you give “advance notice,” you let someone know early or ahead of time.  In case you haven't noticed, the notice posted on your door says you've been promoted and should move to the corner office.  No doubt because of your attention to detail.</li></ul>"

You can use the verb own to describe possession of any kind of property, ranging from a saucepan to a fancy mansion.</li><li>If something can be bought, it can be owned. You wouldn’t say that you own people or intangible objects. But you might own a car, for example, and if you’re lucky, you might own a lot of really cool shoes. Own can also be an adjective describing something that belongs to a particular person, like your own bedroom, or your own mind.

If you predict that you'll win the poker championship, you're either really confident in your poker skills or you're cheating.</li><li>The prefix pre means ""before."" Dict comes from the Latin dicere, which means ""to say,"" yet you can use predict to refer to things that can't say anything at all.  Darkening skies can predict a coming storm, for example, and a runny nose can predict a cold.

Professor is officially a teacher of the highest rank, above adjuncts and lecturers, but college students can call them all professor.</li><li>The Latin origin of the word means “declare publicly,” and professors are responsible for publicly sharing their knowledge with the world, or at least with whoever can afford to pay them for lessons. Although anyone teaching college can be called a professor, it’s really a title that has to be earned by going to graduate school and moving up by being an assistant professor, then associate professor, and finally a full professor.</li></ul>"

You can also rush someone else: ""Don't rush me, I like to stay after the movie and watch the credits!"" It's a noun, too: ""She's obviously in a rush to get somewhere."" A ""rush job"" has an immediate deadline, and  ""rush hour"" is the busiest time of day for drivers in a rush to get to work, or to go home afterward.</li></ul>"

Another kind of stage is the one that actors, singers, and puppet masters perform on. The profession of theater acting itself is in fact sometimes referred to as ""the stage,"" and to put on a play is to stage it. A ""stage whisper"" is one between actors that's loud enough for the audience to hear, and a ""stage name"" is an actor's professional name.</li></ul>"

If the weather report says that a storm is on the way, you might want to carry an umbrella — or just stay at home and watch movies.</li><li>Storms range from the windstorm that blows branches off your tree to the snowstorm that buries your neighborhood under two feet of the white stuff. It's a verb too: ""It began to storm outside, and the rain beat down on the windows."" Figuratively, you might even storm angrily: ""My sister was so mad that she stormed around her room, kicking things."" Something controversial can also cause a figurative storm, or uproar.</li></ul>"

But one week and 100 cupcakes later, it’s become a hard-to-bear burden accompanied by a permanent stomachache.</li><li>Burden is one of those words that doubles as a noun and a verb. Defined as something you carry or withstand with much difficulty when used as a noun, and as the act of weighing down, overloading, or oppressing when used as a verb, it’s a word with a negative charge. Now that you know what it means, you’re equipped to make sure you don’t take on unnecessary burdens (getting pressured into always carrying your neighbor’s groceries upstairs), or become one yourself!</li></ul>"

It can be a noun or a verb. If you compromise with your lab partner over how to analyze the experimental data, you find the middle ground between your two ideas. Compromise can also mean to erode or diminish. If you never repair your brakes, you will compromise the safety of the car.  If you cheat, you compromise your integrity.</li></ul>"

The plunge or drop itself is also a dive: ""When the plane went into a dive I had to close my eyes."" Since 1871, dive has also been used informally for a low-rent or slightly dangerous bar, possibly from the idea that descending to a basement-level establishment involved a ""dive"" of sorts.</li></ul>"

Then around 1600, its definition broadened to mean “liable to break.” It wasn’t until the 19th century that the word started to mean “frail” and was used to describe people.

You can also divide food in half or save half your paycheck each week, while spending the other half. Your half brother is a sibling who shares one of your parents; you and he might have the same mother but different fathers. In Old English, half means ""side"" or ""part.""</li></ul>"

Innocence is very important in many religions, where your moral purity decides what happens to your soul after you die.  The word comes from the Latin innocentia, which means “not harming” and someone with innocence will not harm themselves or others, at least not on purpose.  Remember that there are no ss in innocence, so spell it with two cs.</li></ul>"

If you get moderate rainfall, it's not too much and not too little. Goldilocks was known for her moderate tastes. As a verb, it means ""to temper,"" or ""to reduce from the extreme.""

You might enjoy a stack of pancakes for breakfast, but you'd probably find a truckload of pancakes overwhelming. Sometimes people feel overwhelmed by emotion, and this can be a positive or negative experience, depending on the emotion. For example, you might feel overwhelmed by gratitude if your friend takes excellent care of your fish, but overwhelmed with grief if the fish is accidentally flushed in your absence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U29_0573,"<ul><li>Payment is the process of either giving money to someone, or of receiving money from someone. If you borrow money to buy a car, you'll be expected to make a monthly payment for several years.</li><li>Your paycheck itself is a payment, and so is the act of your boss handing you that paycheck. There are also types of payment that don't involve money, like when your payment for watching your little cousin one afternoon consists of a big piece of your uncle's famous apple pie. Payment, from the verb pay, is rooted in the Latin pacare, used to mean ""satisfy a creditor,"" but originally defined as ""please, satisfy, or make peaceful.""</li></ul>"

Have you ever thought a stair was bigger than it really was so your step was too heavy? Your depth perception was off. The noun also means the opinions and beliefs you've formed about something.

4000EEW_B01_U29_0575,"<ul><li>To settle means to come to order or rest, much as snow settles on the ground or dust settles on the dining room table.</li><li>Settle has a number of meanings. After moving several times, you'll wish your parents would settle in one place for the rest of your school years. Have you ever heard your house creaking or groaning? That's the house settling. When adults tell children to calm down, they'll often say, ""Settle down kids!""

4000EEW_B01_U29_0576,"<ul><li>People shiver, or shake and tremble, when they're very cold. You might shiver in the snow if you forget to wear your winter coat.</li><li>While you are most likely to shiver in the cold, you might also shiver from excitement or even fear.

4000EEW_B01_U29_0577,"<ul><li>When you're sociable, you're willing to talk and be friendly with other people. At a party, it's a good idea to be sociable and make new friends rather than standing off in a corner by yourself.</li><li>Sociable comes from the Latin sociabilis meaning ""close, intimate."" When you are sociable with others, you invite them to get close to you by being friendly and pleasant. When a place or group of people is friendly and inviting, it can be described as sociable. Certain small towns are known to be friendly and sociable.</li></ul>"

When something picks up too much speed, it can run off course, like a kid on a bike zooming uncontrollably down a steep hill.</li><li>Speed can be a noun or verb. As a noun, it's an indicator of pace, as in the speed of a car. As a noun, it's also a drug that keeps you awake, very awake. As a verb, it means to “move along quickly,” like how you speed around on your bike. A fun fact: while speed refers to the distance traveled by an object during a specific amount of time, velocity describes that distance, but in a specified direction.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U29_0579,"<ul><li>A person who is talkative likes to talk — she's friendly and ready to gab at all times about just about anything.</li><li>We all have conversations, but some people enjoy talking more than others: those people are talkative. They find it easy to strike up a conversation, unlike others who may be shy. Being talkative is associated with being friendly. Talkative people can also be described as chatty, garrulous, loquacious, talky, and likely to talk your ear off. If you don’t feel like chatting, you'd better avoid talkative people. The root word of talkative is the Middle English tale, or ""story.""</li></ul>"

On the fourth of July, many Americans like to sit on the ground and watch fireworks above them in the sky.</li><li>The adverb above is good for describing something that happens over your head or something that's up beyond something else. The full moon shines up above you in the night sky, and when your little brother scampers up the monkey bars, he is also above you. The root of above is the Old English word abufan, which combines a, ""on,"" and bufan, or ""over.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0582,"<ul><li>When you're ahead, you're further along or further forward. If you're ahead of all the other runners in a race, you're winning.</li><li>The team at the very front of a three-legged race is ahead, and the path that stretches in front of you as you walk through the woods is ahead of you. As well as signifying being physically first or in front, ahead can be used to talk about time: ""She had her whole life ahead of her."" The word was first used by sailors, to mean ""in a forward direction.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0583,"<ul><li>An amount is a number, or quantity, of something. If you're surprised by the amount of work you have to do at your new job, you probably didn't expect such a long list of tasks.</li><li>You might complain about the amount of time it takes for the shoes you bought to arrive: amount here means the number of days before you can wear them. Amount is also a verb, meaning ""add up to,"" like when you hope the tips you earn will amount to more than minimum wage. This meaning came before the noun amount, from the now obsolete definition, ""to mount a horse,"" from the Old French amonter, ""upward.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0584,"<ul><li>A belief is an idea one accepts as being true or real.  Many children have a strong belief that the Tooth Fairy really does exist.</li><li>The noun belief replaced the Old English word geleafa, meaning “belief, faith,” in the late 12th century. A belief is an idea one usually holds with conviction and importance. In a religious context, the Ancient Greeks held the belief that many gods existed, controlling their fate, while Christianity began with the belief that only one God exists. You can also have belief in yourself in the face of a challenge.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0585,"<ul><li>Whether you are the center of attention or hanging out at the recreation center, you are in the middle of it all.</li><li>You might think of a circle when you think of a center, but a center is also a building or group of buildings. One five-sided place, the Pentagon in the U.S., is actually a center of government activity. A recreation center is a place where a lot of recreation happens, just as a medical center is where a lot of doctors and nurses give medical treatment. These centers are buildings or complexes where a certain kind of activity takes place, and a word before center often tells you what the activity is. As a verb, you can center your attention on something or center a centerpiece in the middle of a table.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0586,"<ul><li>When something's common, it's usual, or it happens frequently. It's more common than you might think for little kids to be terrified of clowns.</li><li>Things that are common happen all the time — they're ordinary. It's common for people to put ketchup on their French fries, and a pigeon is an extremely common type of bird to see in a city. Common can also refer to something that's shared by a group, like a region's common culture. In fact, a green space in the center of a town is sometimes called a common, maybe because it's shared by everyone in the town.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0587,"<ul><li>The cost of something is how much money you need to spend on it. The high cost of a fancy coffee drink might surprise you.</li><li>A new car costs thousands of dollars, while in some places penny candy still only costs a penny per piece. Cost also means ""cause a loss,"" as when a bad fumble costs your favorite football team the game, or your brother's cheating on a test costs him the respect of his favorite teacher. The Old French cost meant ""outlay, expenditure, hardship, or trouble,"" from the Latin root constare, ""to stand at or to cost.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0588,"<ul><li>When you demonstrate something, you show what it is or how it works. To demonstrate how your new juicer works, you should have lots of kale, carrots, and beets on hand — and some brave friends to try your concoction.</li><li>Demonstrate comes from the Latin word demonstrare, meaning “to point out by argument or deduction.” To demonstrate a point you must make a valid argument and give examples of why you think it's true. Demonstrate can also refer to a public protest. You can demonstrate with your comrades by marching through the streets with homemade protest signs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0589,"<ul><li>Something is different whether it is only a little or completely unlike something else. Not only are your two cats different breeds, but they are also different from your pet tiger.</li><li>Often followed by the word than or from, different describes something that contrasts with, or differs from, something else. With roots in the Latin differre, meaning “to set apart,” different can also describe something that belongs in a whole other category. More recently, the word has picked up an additional sense — for something that is special or unique, in an extraordinary or sometimes negative way. That tie your dad has with the different kinds of peppers on it is definitely... different.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0590,"<ul><li>Evidence is anything that can be used to prove something — like the evidence presented in a trial, or the trail of bread crumbs that is evidence of the path Hansel took through the woods.</li><li>The word evidence is derived from the Latin ēvidēnt-, meaning ""obvious."" The word evidence shows up frequently in legal documents and dramas, because evidence is necessary proof in linking someone to a crime or crime scene. Evidence is used in many ways to show that something is true, as in ""the chocolate stains around your mouth and the crumbs on the table are evidence that you ate the last of the brownies.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0591,"<ul><li>If you tell the truth, you possess the quality of honesty.  If someone offers a harsh criticism of your latest attempt at songwriting, you might say, ""Thank you for your honesty.""  Even if you don't mean it.</li><li>The original meaning of honesty had more to do with honor than truthfulness, although the two are naturally linked.  The trait of honesty has been prized for centuries, and Shakespeare once wrote, ""Honesty is the best policy. If I lose mine honor, I lose myself.""  The honesty flower, sometimes called the money plant, is so named because its coin-shaped seedpods are translucent, the idea of transparency symbolizing integrity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0592,"<ul><li>An idiom is a form of expression that is particular to a certain person or group of people. If your friend always says, ""squirrelly nuteriffic!"" when she means something is great, she's using her own idiom.</li><li>Idiom comes from the Greek idios, which means personal. Idiom originally meant ""speech peculiar or proper to a people or country."" These days we use idiom for a specialized vocabulary or an expression that isn't obvious, like kick the bucket which means ""die."" If you're studying a foreign language, idioms are the hardest phrases to translate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0593,"<ul><li>If your brother says you broke his guitar and you say you weren't anywhere near it, your parents may ask your sister for an independent opinion, as she has no reason to lie. An independent person is free from the control or influence of other people.</li><li>The root word, depend, originally meant ""to hang down."" We use the word hang in a similar way. If the decision to build a new stadium hangs on funding, the decision won't be made till the money comes in. To be independent means that you don't depend on your parents to pay your bills. Or, for a three year old, it may mean going to the bathroom ""all by yourself."" It's all relative.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0594,"<ul><li>Something that's inside is located near the center or in the interior of a space. The inside of a perfectly baked potato should be fluffy, buttery, warm, and delicious.</li><li>You can scrape inside a jar with a knife to get the last of the jam, or stay inside the house all day when it's very hot outside. Inside can serve as an adjective, noun, or adverb, depending how you use it, but it always refers to the inner, most privileged, or deepest part of something. Colloquially, your insides are your digestive system or stomach, and when someone's inside after stealing a car, they're in prison.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0595,"<ul><li>A jail is a place where people are confined while they're being punished for a crime. If you end up getting a mug shot and put behind bars, chances are you are In jail.</li><li>To arrest someone and put them in a jail cell is to jail them. Jail prisoners are often simply waiting for their trials — they've been charged with a crime, but they haven't yet been found to be guilty (or innocent). Jail was originally spelled gayhol, and in Britain it's also spelled gaol. This can be traced back to the Medieval Latin gabiola, from Late Latin caveola and the Latin cavea, ""cage or enclosure.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0596,"<ul><li>The original of something (like a recording) is the master. Masters are also experts in fields, from karate to painting.</li><li>Master actors are brilliant actors: they've mastered the skill of acting: maybe they have a Master of Fine Arts degree. It takes a long time to master anything. The master is the head of a school. People with servants, pets, and (during a horrible period in our history) slaves were called masters. A master key opens many doors, and when you master something, you are extremely good at it. An A+ on a test shows you mastered the material.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0597,"<ul><li>Memory is the power to retain and recall information and past experiences. Your brain's memory helps you recall lots of memories — like multiplication tables and bad dates.</li><li>The word memory applies to both the individual facts and experiences you remember as well as the brain's ability to contain it all.  A good memory for names means you retain someone's name. But a good memory of your summer job means that you had fun while working at the Jiffy Lube. Memory has also come to refer to a computer's capacity to store information.  As far as we know, however, computers do not have fond memories of their past programs.</li></ul>"

If you are worried about your ink pen leaking in your shirt pocket, then you might spring for a pocket protector. Nice look!</li><li>You can keep things like your keys in a pocket, or you can use your pockets to keep your hands warm. Jackets and jeans have pockets, and so do kangaroos and pool tables. In the case of kangaroos, it's a handy pouch in a mother's belly where she can keep a baby kangaroo warm and comfortable. And when you shoot pool, you aim for the pockets. As a verb, pocket can literally mean ""put into your pocket,"" or more figuratively, ""steal money."" To be ""in someone's pocket"" is to be under their control or influence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B01_U30_0599,"<ul><li>Something proper is correct or right. There's a proper fork to use for salad, and a proper way to dress for a wedding.</li><li>Things that are proper fit the situation — they're the right thing to do, because of custom or manners. A swear word is the opposite of proper language. Wearing a hat indoors isn't proper, as your grandparents have probably reminded you.

Back then, it was the people doing the buying who got called ""expensive."" Now it's the costly things they buy or take part in. For example, sailing is an expensive hobby. If someone tells you, ""I have expensive taste,"" it means that person likes things that cost a lot of money, whether they are purchased or just admired from the shop window.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U01_0604,"<ul><li>If someone tells you they think you'll flower when you go to college, they don't mean they think you'll grow blossoms on your head, but that you'll really come into your own and find your potential.</li><li>A flower is a fragile blossom that has petals and grows at the top of the stem of a plant. Flowers attract bees, who help out with the pollination process so more plants can grow. Roses, daisies, and carnations are all types of flowers. Flower is also a verb meaning to bring forth flowers. And if something besides a plant — a business, a person, a community — has a period of extra productivity or prosperity, we say it is flowering.</li></ul>"

Your grandmother might be so proud of her rose garden that she gives every visitor a tour of it.</li><li>A vegetable garden is often planted in straight rows, sometimes within a raised bed. Flower gardens can take all sorts of shapes, from tidy to meandering. When you work in your garden, pulling weeds or planting seedlings, you garden. In the UK, a garden is what's called a yard in the US — any bit of land just outside of a house. The phrase ""garden variety"" means ""ordinary:"" ""Oh he's just a garden variety mixed-breed dog, nothing fancy.""</li></ul>"

You might observe the Indian holiday of Holi, and take a week off of work to celebrate with your family.</li><li>A holiday is an occasion recognized by the state or federal government and marked on calendars, like Thanksgiving in the United States. Most holidays are celebratory and fun, and just about all of them mean no work or school.  You can also take a holiday, or vacation. Holiday comes from ""holy"" and ""day,"" meaning a religious festival, and the word was even pronounced that way until the sixteenth century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U01_0607,"<ul><li>If you have a great number of refrigerator magnets, you have many of them. Many means ""a lot of items.""</li><li>Many can be traced back to the Welsh word mynych meaning ""frequent."" To get many of something, you do something frequently, or often, like having many miles on a car because you often drive it long distances. If you ask, ""How many people will be at the party?"" you want to know the number of guests who are expected. If the answer is ""many,"" you know there will be numerous people, though you haven't been given an exact figure.</li></ul>"

If you have a million dollars, you’re a millionaire!</li><li>The word million comes from the Italian milione, which literally means ""a great thousand.” It’s great to have a thousand, but it’s awesome to have a million! A million is a big number but not so big that you don't see it used frequently. In fact, being a millionaire isn’t even a big deal anymore. An online video might be watched by a million viewers, and there are millions of people in big cities like New York City and Chicago.</li></ul>"

It's not to be confused with a molehill.</li><li>The word mountain has been around since the 1200s. A mountain is much larger than an average hill; it's a mass of land that rises up to 2000 feet or so. Mountain does not always describe a land mass. It can also be used to refer to an undertaking, a pile of something, or even a large dose of trouble. You might have a mountain of mashed potatoes you don't want to eat, or a mountain of homework.</li></ul>"

Thankfully, Bella Abzug updated that notion by saying ""A woman's place is in the House... the House of Representatives."" Place can also be a verb: you can place, or set down, books on a table.

4000EEW_B02_U01_0611,"<ul><li>The adjective popular describes something that is well-liked or admired by a lot of people. Sometimes when you read a bestselling novel, you wonder why it's so popular.</li><li>Popular comes from the Latin word populus, which means people. Anything that is popular is liked by many people. When you're talking about popular music or art, you may sometimes shorten the word popular to ""pop,"" as in pop music or pop culture. Popular also describes things by or for the people, or the general population, such as the popular vote or a popular revolt.</li></ul>"

You can also cross country ski, or move across flat, snowy ground and gentle hills on skis. The special boots that skiers wear are called ski boots, and you also need a ski helmet and ski goggles when you go skiing.

A total is a whole or complete amount, and ""to total"" is to add numbers or to destroy something.</li><li>In math, you total numbers by adding them: the result is the total. If you add 8 and 8, the total is 16. If a car is totaled in an accident, it has been completely destroyed. A total defeat is a complete and utter defeat with no chance of recovering.

If you have a super tall friend and you're short, you could say they tower over you.</li><li>Towers can come in handy––you can build one and climb to the top, looking out for approaching enemies, or in the case of a fire tower, for early signs of forest fires. One of the most famous towers is the Tower of London, with its long-held reputation as a place of torture and execution. Most people are surprised to learn that only seven people were executed in the Tower.</li></ul>"

A town has a specific boundary, a name, and (usually) its own government.</li><li>A town is essentially a small city. It's got a smaller population and usually has fewer big apartment buildings and more single-family homes. When something or someone is in town, they are visiting your town: ""I'm so excited that the circus is in town!"" And if you go out on the town, you take advantage of the nightlife in a town or city.</li></ul>"

That's right, putting your feet into motion is what you need to do to walk.</li><li>The words walk isn't just used to describe the action of taking one step in front of the other. In baseball, it's a term for when a batter receives four balls and is given the right to walk to first base. When a horse's gate is slow and it keeps two feel always on the ground, that's a walk. When you choose a particular path for yourself in life, you could call that a walk of life.</li></ul>"

If you agree to watch your neighbor's puppy, it means that you've promised to observe him carefully and make sure he doesn't get into trouble. When watch is a noun, it is the timepiece you wear on your wrist. Many people use their cell phones to get the time of day, instead of their watches.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U01_0620,"<ul><li>The noun world usually refers to the earth, including both the planet itself and the organisms that live on it.

While today you can use the words world and earth interchangeably, world originally meant just human experience; the Old English wer, or man, plus ald, or age, together formed weralt: the age of man.</li></ul>"

In medical terms, to be anxious means feeling uneasy and worried but not always with a specific focus. On the other hand, being anxious can also mean that you are very eager. One meaning is negative and the other is positive!</li></ul>"

That new car costs an awful lot of money, for example. Perhaps you should think about a bus pass or bicycle instead! As an adverb, awful is used as an intensifier, meaning very. As in, ""It's taking you an awful long time to finish that paper. Stop procrastinating.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0623,"<ul><li>Almost always used with the preposition ""of,"" the verb consist means to be made up of, or composed of something. A heated conversation might consist of only two words: ""yes"" and ""no.""</li><li>If you're talking about something that is made up of other things, consist is your word. A molecule consists of atoms and their bonds. Consist is often used in the past tense, so you're likely to hear it used in a sentence like ""the game consisted of fourteen players and one stick."" But you can use it in the present tense too. Grammar consists of many, many different rules, all of which are applied differently, depending on whether you're speaking or writing. The clubs all consist of singers, and singers only. If you play an instrument, look elsewhere, bud.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0624,"<ul><li>If you're talking about the longings of the heart, use the word desire. When you are studying for a difficult history exam, the desire to be somewhere far away doing something fun might be very strong!</li><li>Desire can be used as both a noun and a verb. Is your boyfriend your heart's desire? Your parents probably desire your punctual appearance at the dinner table every evening. Desire is usually used not just when you long for any old thing, but for something that is associated with giving great pleasure. Thus, you might want to get an A on a test, but you desire a piece of chocolate cake.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0625,"<ul><li>The adjective eager describes someone is excited about or impatient for something. If you want to be a doctor one day, you might be eager to dissect a frog in biology. Your squeamish friend? Not so eager.</li><li>Eager derives from old words meaning ""sharp, pungent or keen,"" and eager carries that sense of sharpness still. In fact, being overeager is a criticism; someone overeager is likely to make a mistake because they are moving too quickly or not thinking things through before they act.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0626,"<ul><li>How many people does your house hold? That’s your household! A household refers to a family or group of people living together.

Well, your roommates count as part of your household, too. In the middle of the night, your household might be asleep. Your household income could determine whether or not you get the pool in the backyard. Household can also be an adjective to describe — you guessed it — things that are in your house, like household appliances or household furniture.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0627,"<ul><li>If you are intent on doing something, you are determined to get it done. If you have an intent, you have a motive or purpose.</li><li>Intention and intent are synonyms, but with a subtle difference. Intention implies a general desire or plan to accomplish something, while intent is a little stronger, indicating a firm resolve to get it done. Intent can be used as a noun or adjective. So you may be intent on finishing your homework, but the amount of it has you convinced of your teacher's ill intent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0628,"<ul><li>To landscape is to enhance a space with plants. If you landscape your yard with flowering plants and trees — and you have a green thumb — you'll end up with a beautiful garden.</li><li>If you paint nature scenes, like mountains, lakes, or fields, your art is called landscape painting. If you don't paint that well, however, and the perspective on your landscapes is always a little bit off, you can try landscape photography instead. Any expanse of natural scenery that can be seen from one viewpoint is also called a landscape. The artistic meaning of landscape is the earliest, dating from the 1600s.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0629,"<ul><li>To lift something is to pick it up, or raise it in the air. You'll need to lift a flag before you start waving it.</li><li>You can lift things literally, like when you lift your cat in the air to save it from your dog's slobbery tongue, or lift your glass for a New Year's Eve toast. You can also lift things figuratively, like when someone lifts your spirits, cheering you up, or when winning first prize in a contest lifts a writer from obscurity, elevating her position in the literary world. In Britain, lift is also another word for ""elevator.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0630,"<ul><li>A load is a bundle of stuff that has to be carried. You might spend your days hauling loads of hay into a barn and your evenings dragging loads of dirty clothes into the laundry room.</li><li>Loads need to be picked up and hauled somewhere, like a load of firewood in a pickup truck or a load of supplies in a hiker's backpack. There are figurative loads too — the responsibility, hardship, or worry that you carry around with you: ""Her teaching load is light, which is good because her sick cat is a heavy load on her mind."" As a verb, load means ""fill,"" like when you load your lunch box with Twinkies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0631,"<ul><li>A lung is an internal organ that makes it possible for you to breathe. Your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your body while sending oxygen into your blood stream.</li><li>All vertebrates — animals with a spinal column — have lungs. Humans have two of them, and they're what makes your chest rise and fall as you breathe in and out. They're also the organs that keep you breathing, and therefore alive. Lung, by way of the Old English lungen, comes from an Indo-European root that literally means ""the light organ.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0632,"<ul><li>Motion is the way things get from place to place. The ball rolling down a hill is in motion, and as Isaac Newton once proved, it will remain in motion until it hits a wall or something else that makes it stop.</li><li>When motion is used as a noun, it describes movement, like the motion that propels a car from one end of the highway to another. When used as a verb, motion means to signal or direct. ""A restaurant patron will motion to the server when he's ready for the check."" Someone who is just ""going through the motions"" doesn't have to move at all, because they're just pretending.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0633,"<ul><li>Pace is how fast something travels a particular distance, like a runner who tries to achieve a consistent pace, running each mile in more or less the same amount of time.</li><li>Pace comes from the Latin word passus, meaning “a step.” Pace is a noun, meaning ""the speed at which something happens."" Some say city life has a faster pace because everyone hurries and there are so many exciting things to do. Pace is also a verb — if you pace yourself, you’ll have enough energy to experience all of that city's sights, from the rush of rush hour to the late-night party scene.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0634,"<ul><li>Polite means showing regards for others in manners, speech, and behavior. Since you are a polite dinner guest, you thank the host for inviting you and, even though you think the chicken is not cooked to perfection, you tell her you are enjoying the meal.</li><li>The adjective polite comes from the mid-13th century Latin politus, which means ""refined"" or ""elegant."" Showing consideration for others, using tact, and observing social norms are the qualities of being polite. The opposite of polite is rude. Because the poet E.E. Cummings thought imagination is most important, he wrote, “Knowledge is a polite word for dead but not buried imagination.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0635,"<ul><li>To possess something is to have or own it. You can possess a physical object, you can possess a particular quality or skill, or you can possess control or influence over someone.</li><li>Related words are possessive (describing those who hold onto people or things in a controlling way), and possessed, as in a person being possessed by an idea or even by a demon. This verb is from Middle French posséder ""to own,"" from Latin possidēre, from potis ""able, having the power"" plus sedēre ""to sit.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0636,"<ul><li>When you do something rapidly, you do it very quickly. A rapidly moving train is going at full speed.</li><li>You may notice that the grass in your yard grows rapidly during the rainy summer days and more slowly when there's a heat wave. You might also get a speeding ticket for driving too rapidly in a school zone. In either case, something's happening fast. The adverb rapidly comes from the adjective rapid, ""moving quickly,"" with the Latin root rapidus, ""hasty, swift, fierce, or impetuous.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0637,"<ul><li>""If you see something, say something"" might translate into, ""If you remark something, make a remark."" Remark means to notice, and it also means to comment, as in, ""Keep your obnoxious remarks to yourself.""</li><li>While walking in the woods, you might remark the contrast between the quiet of the woods and the noises of the city. You might make a remark about how loud it is in the city. ""It's loud here too,"" your walking companion might remark. ""Listen to all the birds and squirrels.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0638,"<ul><li>If you seek an accordion player for your new polka band, it means you are looking for a band mate.</li><li>When you seek something, you try to find it. It's possible to seek fame, or snacks, or a college degree, or approval — as long as you're looking for it, or longing for it, you're seeking it. The origins of the word seek go back to the Latin word sagire, which means ""to perceive keenly by scent."" Imagine a dog tracking a rabbit, sniffing the ground and following its scent, and you'll know exactly what it means to seek something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0639,"<ul><li>To shine is to give off a bright, glowing light. Your porch light shines at night, and if the sky is clear and cloudless, the moon will shine too.</li><li>The sun and a light bulb both shine, and things that simply reflect light can be said to shine too, like a diamond ring or clean, glossy hair. In a more figurative way, people shine when they stand out for doing something extremely well: ""The lead actress really shines in her role as Lady Macbeth."" The Old English root of shine is scinan, which means ""shed light, be radiant, or illuminate,"" and also ""be conspicuous.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U02_0640,"<ul><li>When liquids spill, they accidentally flow or dribble out of a container. You can also spill solid objects, like when you slip and spill the contents of your backpack all over the sidewalk.</li><li>When you spill your hot chocolate, the spot it makes where it lands is a spill. The act of spilling it is a spill too: ""Sorry about the spill, Grandma."" You can take a spill yourself, like when you tumble to the ground from your bike. Spill also means ""talk,"" especially in the context of ""spill the beans"" or ""spill your guts,"" both basically meaning ""tell the whole truth.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0641,"<ul><li>An arrow is a pointed weapon that's shot with a bow. If you enjoy archery, you like to shoot arrows at a target.</li><li>A bow consists of a piece of wood, metal, or plastic that has a flexible string connected to each end, and an arrow is the smaller, sharp-ended projectile that's held as the string is stretched back. When the string is released, the arrow flies. The Old English source of arrow is earh, which most likely comes from an Old Norse root.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0642,"<ul><li>A battle is an open struggle, usually between two groups — like a baseball championship game or a food fight.</li><li>The word battle is often used in opposition to war, a series of battles. Perhaps you have heard someone tell you, after winning the first of many dance competitions, ""You may have won the battle, but you haven’t won the war!"" A battle doesn’t have to occur between two individuals or groups. You may endure an inner battle to cut down on junk food. If you skip those fries for lunch today, then you have won a small battle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0643,"<ul><li>If you want to practice your archery, you'll need some arrows and a bow — a curved piece of wood (or other material), with a cord stretched between the ends that is used to launch the arrows.</li><li>The bow of a stringed instrument (like a violin or cello) was originally shaped like an archer's bow used in archery and thus shares the same name. When you move the bow across the strings, you're bowing. Sometimes violinists bow and sometimes they pluck the strings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0644,"<ul><li>Courageous, dauntless, perhaps a little bit daring, a person who is brave faces dangerous or difficult situations with courage.</li><li>The adjective brave can be used to describe anyone or anything that displays courage, such as a brave firefighter, a brave guide dog, or even brave holiday shoppers. In addition to its adjective form, the word brave can also act as a verb. Use the verb brave when you want to say that someone is facing a dangerous or unpleasant situation courageously: “Only the hardiest skiers were able to brave the icy conditions and complete the course.” Both adjective and verb forms of the word share a common meaning — the sense of having courage or acting fearlessly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0645,"<ul><li>A chief is a leader, often of a tribe or clan. Sometimes we call the president our ""commander in chief.""</li><li>A chief is the head honcho, the big cheese, the top dog. Tribes are lead by chiefs, but so are firefighters (fire chief), policeman (police chief), and companies (Chief Executive Officer or CEO). When used as an adjective, chief describes the most important element or main ingredient of something. You couldn't make mac and cheese without the chief ingredients: macaroni and cheese.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0646,"<ul><li>A piece of bad luck or a less favorable position is a disadvantage. If you are trying to run a fifty-yard dash in flip flops when everyone else has on running shoes, you'll be at a disadvantage.</li><li>It's harder to be successful when you start with a disadvantage. One kind of disadvantage is being born into a poor family — it's a struggle for a child in poverty to do well in school, attend college, or end up with a well-paying job. A disadvantage is the opposite of an advantage, a lucky or favorable circumstance. At the root of both words is the Old French avant, ""at the front.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0647,"<ul><li>An enemy is a hostile opponent, like your sworn Scrabble enemy who vows to get revenge on your last triple word score.</li><li>An enemy is a person who actively opposes someone or something. The Latin word inimicus, meaning ""hostile, unfriendly,"" is the root of enemy, and it comes from the prefix in-, or ""not,"" and amicus, ""friend:"" an enemy is ""not a friend.""  When two armies fight each other, they both think of the opposing army as the enemy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0648,"<ul><li>As a noun, entrance means an act of entering or something that provides a way to enter something. You can make a grand entrance when you arrive at a party, as long as you can actually find the entrance.</li><li>Entrance has two pronunciations. If you put the accent on the first syllable, the word is a noun meaning the act of entering or the way into something (""an entrance to the building""). If the accent is on the second syllable, then entrance is a verb meaning ""to enchant, charm, or enamor"" — ""You will be entranced by the movie; the scenery looks so real you will swear it is growing in the theater.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0649,"<ul><li>The adverb hardly means barely or scarcely at all. If you hardly ever visit your cousins in California, it means you almost never travel to see them.</li><li>If you hardly know your neighbor, you only know him a little bit, and if you hardly understand what your French teacher says, you're only catching every few words she speaks. Hardly can also be used to talk about time: ""We can't leave yet — the party's hardly started!"" Hardly originally had nearly the opposite meaning: ""with great exertion or effort."" The phrase ""not hardly,"" or ""a little,"" eventually lost the ""not"" and became the hardly we know today.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0650,"<ul><li>If you intend to do something, you mean to do it or have it in mind as a goal. Do you plan on getting your holiday cards in the mail before February this year? Then you intend on getting them out early.</li><li>The world is full of good intentions, meaning there are lots of people who intend to be nice, eat better, floss more, or pick up their dirty socks. But things don't always go as planned. Your actions could produce results that you didn't expect, specify, or ever intend — that might explain the well-known proverb, ""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0651,"<ul><li>Whether you giggle or chuckle or snort with amusement, what you're producing is laughter. Laughter is also what people hear when you laugh.</li><li>Funny movies, your friends' jokes, and absurd or embarrassing situations all cause laughter, which is the word for both the action and the sound of someone laughing. Laughter can be a silent, shaking movement, or a loud guffaw. There are a few other primates besides humans who experience laughter, and most babies can shake with laughter before they're even able to speak.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0652,"<ul><li>A log is the trunk of a tree minus the branches: logging is cutting down trees. A log is also a written record of something, and logging is keeping such a record.</li><li>The first type of log is a tree that's been cut down with the branches stripped. Think of a log cabin: it's made up of logs. Logging is when trees are cut down for lumber. The other type of log is some type of written record or list of messages. A ship captain keeps a log of notes on the ship's status and progress. When you make such a record, you're logging. Logging can be written or orally recorded.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0653,"<ul><li>Ten, hut! So you'd like the definition of military? Yes, Sir! The adjective military is used to describe anything related to the armed forces or soldiers.</li><li>Stemming from the Latin word for ""soldier,"" military is a word that goes hand in hand with war. It's the military that protects a country's interests, lead by generals and powered by brave soldiers. When used as an adjective, military describes anything that's related to, well, the military: salutes, campaigns, uniforms, etc.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0654,"<ul><li>When you obey, you follow someone's rules or instructions. In the old days, all of a monarchy's citizens were expected to obey the commands of their king or queen.</li><li>You might be expected to obey the rules your strict parents lay down, or to obey the guidelines of a group or club you belong to. Religious Christians obey God, and soldiers obey the direct orders their commanding officers give them. To obey is to be obedient, and both words come from the Latin obedire, which literally means ""listen to,"" but is used to mean ""pay attention to.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0655,"<ul><li>Secure means safe, protected. Your money is secure in a bank. Supportive friends and family make you feel secure.</li><li>Secure can also be used as a verb. You secure the sails before you take out the sailboat, which means you tie them down. If you secure someone a ticket to a popular Broadway play, you've found them a hard-to-find seat. On an airplane, you're told that in the event you need an oxygen mask, you should secure yours — get it in place — before helping someone else. Almost all meanings contain the idea of safety: making sure things are right.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0656,"<ul><li>The adjective steady describes something that is firmly fixed in position. If you have to climb up on your roof, you definitely want to have a steady ladder. Otherwise, you risk ending up in the bushes instead of on the roof.</li><li>The adjective steady can also describe something that isn't going to fluctuate wildly. If you have a steady income from a salary, you bring in approximately the same amount of money each month. If you are paid on commission, on the other hand, you may make Midas look poor in some months and beggars look rich in others. As a verb, to steady means ""to make something steady"" (big surprise): You can steady a wobbly table by sticking a matchbook under its shortest leg, or you could steady a nervous dog with a reassuring pat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0657,"<ul><li>If you trust someone then you believe that they’re honest and reliable. If you loan your car to someone, you had better trust them to bring it back to you, and in good shape.</li><li>Trust takes many forms. You could trust in something abstract, like the idea that things happen for a reason. If you are naïve, people might take advantage of your trust. A trust can also be a fund or an alliance meant to take care of something. A trust fund gives money to some lucky trustee so that he doesn’t need to worry about employment. A wildlife trust saves land from development so animals can live there.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U03_0658,"<ul><li>When you twist something, you turn it in a different direction. You might twist off a bottle cap, or you might even twist the plot of a story you are writing.</li><li>A kite's tail twists in the wind, curling around itself, and a baker twists a piece of dough into a pretzel shape. You can also twist out of someone's grasp (to escape your godmother's cheek pinching), or twist your ankle hurrying away. As a noun, twist means a bent and curved shape, like the twist of a curl or a twist of soft serve ice cream. In a book or movie plot, a twist is a shocking development.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U03_0660,"<ul><li>A weapon is something used to hurt someone. Soldiers use weapons like guns and even sometimes use ""weapons of mass destruction"" — like bombs. In school, the only weapon you should use is a spitball.</li><li>A solider engaging in battle needs a weapon, as does a police officer defending herself against a violent attacker. Some weapons are specially designed for killing or injuring, such as guns and crossbows, while in other cases an ordinary object, like a stick, can be used as a weapon. The Old English root is wæpen, ""instrument of fighting or defense."" The spelling is tricky, and most people just have to memorize the ea in weapon.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0661,"<ul><li>Your chest is the part of your body from your stomach to your neck. A bodybuilder or weightlifter is distinctive not only for his huge arms, but for his big, muscular chest.</li><li>The character Tarzan is known for thumping his own chest while yelling — but if Tarzan gets a bad cold, he might cough so hard that his chest aches. Another kind of chest is a storage box with a connected lid that swings open. This is the oldest meaning of chest, from the Old English cest, ""box or casket."" The anatomical meaning comes from the idea that the ribs form a ""box"" — or a chest — around the internal organs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0662,"<ul><li>The noun confidence means ""a feeling of trust and firm belief in yourself or others."" A person who walks into a room, smiling at everyone and not at all nervous about the speech she's about to give? She has confidence.</li><li>Confidence comes from the Middle French word of the same spelling, which means ""firmly trusting, bold."" You can have confidence in yourself, another person, your country, even your rain boots — what you put your confidence in will not let you down. Confidence can also mean ""in secret,"" like when your neighbor tells you in confidence that he and his family are thinking of moving away — he doesn't want others to know.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0663,"<ul><li>Things in a sequence come one after another, as in a number sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4. A consequence comes after, or as a result of something you do, for example, ""He was given a traffic ticket as a consequence of running the red light.""</li><li>A consequence is a ""result"" or ""conclusion,"" and the Latin sequī, ""to follow,"" is part of its history. Most actions and acts of nature have a consequence that follows as a result. When people do something wrong, like rob a bank, the consequence will probably be prison time. If an organization works for good and finds a cure for cancer, on the other hand, people will get better as a consequence. When something occurs in nature, like a tornado touching down, destruction might be the consequence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0664,"<ul><li>An earthquake, an oil spill, an economic collapse, a party with inedible food and truly awful music: Each of these could be described as a disaster, a cataclysmic event causing extreme suffering, even total destruction.</li><li>Disaster made its way into the English language from Greek. The second part of the word is derived from astron — ""star"" or ""planet,"" familiar from words like astronomy and astronaut. Dis- is prefix with a meaning similar to ""un-"" or ""mis-,"" but with clearly negative connotations. 
Translated literally, disaster means ""bad or unlucky star,"" and it's a relic of a time when astrology was considered a serious science that could predict events — including disasters you might try to avoid — in your life on Earth!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0665,"<ul><li>To disturb is to bother. If you hang a ""Do not disturb"" sign on the outside of your hotel room door, you want to be left alone.</li><li>Disturb comes from the Latin prefix dis-, meaning ""completely"" and turbare, meaning ""to disorder."" To disturb is, in a sense, to completely disorder. When you disturb something, you interfere with its normal function. Along those lines, it's also a word used to describe the interruption of sleep or relaxation. Your alarm disturbs you from sleep every morning. When something disturbs you, it can also cause you emotional anxiety.  A horror movie might disturb you with its goriness.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0666,"<ul><li>A rough calculation or appraisal is an estimate. When you hit another baseball through the kitchen window, your parents will get an estimate of the repair costs. And you should estimate being grounded for approximately 3 weeks.</li><li>An estimate is kind of like a very educated guess. Making an estimate takes good evaluation skills, and usually estimates are pretty close to the actual outcome. If the garage bill is way higher than the estimate they gave you, for example, you have a right to be angry. But if you forgot to factor in rush hour traffic when you estimated the drive from Boston to New York, that's your own fault.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0667,"<ul><li>Honor has many uses, all of them good. If you are called a man of honor, you are respected. If someone honors you, they recognize and award you for your achievements.</li><li>The term honor has always been a word used to describe men and women of high moral worth or great achievement. It can be used as either a noun or verb, and in many different settings. People graduate from college with honor, meaning they have outstanding grades. A woman of honor is pure and decent. Soldiers are buried with full military honors, which means they are given gun salutes and trumpet calls and the nation's fullest respect.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0668,"<ul><li>Think of the verb impress as ""leaving a mark."" You might impress a print onto canvas, or you might impress prospective employers in a job interview. Whether that impression will be good or bad is up to you!</li><li>The past participle of the Latin verb imprimere, ""to press,"" is impressus, which evolved in the 14th century to the meaning ""to make a permanent image."" The word then came to be used figuratively, as when your parents impress upon you the importance of being honest or when you impress the judges at a diving competition. Impress can also mean to conscript someone into the army.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0669,"<ul><li>Narrow means less wide or to make less wide. When you narrow down your choices, you decrease the number of choices. A road might be too narrow for a car.</li><li>When used to describe something physical such as a street or hips, narrow simply means not wide. Similarly, with quantities it means not much like when you win your basketball game by a narrow margin. But if you use it to describe an attitude, it has the negative meaning of not wide or open enough. If you're narrow-minded, you don't see the big picture –– sometimes it means you think in narrow stereotypes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0670,"<ul><li>After a long summer in the pool and the bright sun, your favorite rainbow-colored beach swimsuit will probably end up pale and faded. Pale means ""having little color.""</li><li>When something's light colored, you can describe it as pale, like a pale light shining in the kitchen at night, or a person's pale face when they're suffering from the flu. Pale is also a verb that means ""to become pale,"" so you could say that you saw your friend's face pale at the news that her favorite bakery had gone out of business. Don't make the mistake of confusing pale with its homophone, pail, which means ""bucket.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0671,"<ul><li>Rough means harsh and uneven. If you want to go driving in the rough terrain of rocky dirt roads, you'll need four-wheel drive and a stomach for bouncing.</li><li>Rough means coarse or bumpy, and can be used in many different ways. A few days after you shave, your skin will be rough with stubble. Rough seas are choppy and turbulent, and might make you seasick. On a rough day, lots of things go wrong. A rough person (who could be called ""a rough"") tends to get into fights. Someone raised on a farm in the mountains could be described as having a rough and rugged life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0672,"<ul><li>To satisfy is to fulfill or meet a want, need, requirement, or expectation. A brilliant paper on Edgar Allan Poe might satisfy a literature class requirement, and a candy bar might satisfy a craving for chocolate.</li><li>Since there are so many things we need and want, there are lots of ways to satisfy us. Eating a sandwich will satisfy your hunger. Overhearing a conversation could satisfy your curiosity. Going to school should satisfy your desire for knowledge. In college, you'll have to take certain classes to satisfy requirements of your degree. The word comes from the Latin satisfacere, which basically means “do enough.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0673,
4000EEW_B02_U04_0674,"<ul><li>Sensitive describes something or someone who reacts quickly and strongly. It's often something to protect — like baby skin, government documents, or a fragile ecosystem.</li><li>Anything sensitive should be treated with special care. It can mean ""raw or hurting"" when talking about a part of the body. After people visit the dentist, their gums are often sensitive because of the way that big angry lady cleaned their teeth. Sensitive people get their feelings hurt easily. Sensitive documents have big secrets that shouldn't get out. A sensitive tape recorder catches all the little background sounds. Now you should have a sense of the word sensitive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0675,"<ul><li>Shade is a break from the glare of the sun, like the shade of a big tree or the shade under a beach umbrella.</li><li>Other meanings of shade also come from the sense of ""blocking the sun,"" like a window shade, the shade that diffuses the light from a lamp, or the shades (or sunglasses) you wear at the beach. The same is true when shade is a verb: ""This hat is ridiculously big, but it really shades my face from the sun!"" If you ""throw shade,"" you're criticizing or expressing contempt for someone in a public way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0676,"<ul><li>Strength is the property of being physically strong (you can do, say, 100 push-ups) or mentally strong (you can calculate percentages in your head while people are shouting at you).</li><li>Strength has several shades of meaning. The strength of something can be the measure of how much force or pressure it can withstand over time (like a flood wall). Or its potency (like a pesticide). Or its intensity level (like a radio signal). Its fighting capabilities (like an army). Or its specialty: A chameleon's strength is actually in its ability to blend in with its surroundings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0677,"<ul><li>A supplement is something added to something else. Nutritional supplements add vitamins and minerals to the ones already included in the food you eat.</li><li>If a zombie army wants to increase its ranks but is running out of bodies, it might supplement its troops with mummies. If the zombies put out their manifesto and then realize they left out an important point, they might supplement the manifesto with a press release. That press release could also be referred to as a supplement.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0678,"<ul><li>Terror is the feeling of extreme fear. If you unexpectedly find someone dressed up as a vampire in your closet in the middle of a dark night, you might well experience feelings of terror.</li><li>If you feel terror, you are frozen to the spot in fear. This is the goal of terrorists who use terror as a weapon —  they create a climate of fear and mistrust so that people are afraid to go about their normal lives. You will recognize this use in the phrase “the war on terror.” You can also call a difficult  or scary person, often a child who causes havoc, a terror or a holy terror.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0679,"<ul><li>A threat is an impending danger that has the potential to cause serious harm — it just hasn't done so yet. In The Wizard of Oz, the huge tornado that spiraled across the Kansas countryside posed a threat to the little girl named Dorothy in its path.</li><li>If a huge thug carrying an equally huge knife approaches you in a dark alley and demands, ""Your wallet or your life,"" you feel the imminent threat. Your safety is at risk, especially if you don't hand over that wallet. Threats don't have to be big and scary, though. An extra-large slice of chocolate cake isn't armed and dangerous, but it's still a serious threat to any dieter who's trying to cut calories. Or, you could see a gray cloud as promising the threat of rain showers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U04_0680,"<ul><li>Use the word victim to describe someone who has been wronged or harmed, like the victim of the armed robbery or the stores that went out of business, victims of the slow economy.</li><li>The noun victim refers to a person who has been harmed by a crime, accident, or other adverse circumstances, such as a victim of a tsunami or a victim of domestic violence. It can also refer to someone has been tricked or swindled, like when you paid $2 for a candy bar that should only have cost a dollar — you were the victim of someone's scheme to pocket half the money from the candy bar sale.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0681,"<ul><li>An ancestor came before. Your grandmother's grandmother and any relative before her is one of your ancestors.</li><li>Ante-, a common Latin prefix, means ""before."" Cedere is Latin for ""to go."" So, an ancestor is someone who has gone before us. Evolutionary biologists have advanced the theory that all life on earth descends from a common ancestor. Ancestor can also mean ""prototype"" or ""forerunner."" The abacus is a distant ancestor of today's supercomputers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0682,"<ul><li>Remember all those pesky geometry classes in high school? Then you'll remember measuring the angle or space between two intersecting lines in degrees. If you recall that a right angle measures ninety degrees, give yourself a bonus.</li><li>Angle can also mean a biased way of looking at or presenting something. Talk radio stations, for example, often discuss current events with a ""political angle."" On a far more peaceful note, to angle also means simply to fish, both in the literal sense of trying to catch a fish on a hook or in the metaphorical sense of trying to subtly obtain something without being seen to do so directly, as in, ""I'm going to angle for a promotion at work.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0683,"<ul><li>A boot is the kind of shoe that can rise as high as your knee, like riding boots, or just up to your ankle, like silver-studded Beatle boots. To boot means to kick something (with or without the fancy footwear).</li><li>Like most fashionable things, the word boot comes from the Old French bote. It used to refer only to riding boots, but now any big ol’ high-rise shoe kind of thing is a boot. Since boots are for feet, when you boot someone, you kick them. If you give someone the boot, you’re kicking him out. A totally different type of booting involves starting up an operating system on a computer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0684,"<ul><li>When you cross a border from one country into another, you'll need to show your identification papers and maybe a visa to the border patrol officials.</li><li>A border separates one thing from another, most famously countries. Sometimes neighboring countries have border disputes, if they don't think the lines were drawn fairly or if they don't get along. Borders can also be less official. You might want to plant a border of cabbages along your front walk, or you could sew a border of sequins along the edge of your collar. But you'd have to go easy on the sequins, as too many would ""border on the garish.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0685,"<ul><li>When you congratulate someone, you give that person praise — or maybe even a party to congratulate him or her on a job well done.</li><li>The word congratulate is linked to the Latin word congratulari, meaning “wish joy.” When you congratulate someone, you wish him or her joy, usually to celebrate an accomplishment or good fortune. Your joy can take the form of verbal praise (“Well done!”), a letter or card offering good wishes, a rowdy high five, or even a big chocolate cake. You can also congratulate yourself for reaching a long-time goal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0686,"<ul><li>A frame is a basic shape or structure, especially one that outlines or surrounds a door or window. If you slam your bedroom door hard enough, the whole frame might shake.</li><li>When frame is a noun, it is usually some kind of enclosure or outline that is also a physical support — like the frame around a window, a bed frame, or a picture frame. One frozen image, or still, from a movie is another kind of frame. As a verb, to frame means both to enclose something in a frame, the way you frame a painting, and to make it look like an innocent person is guilty of something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0687,"<ul><li>Heaven is a place that seems absolutely perfect in every way. You can think of it as the lofty heavens up above, or as a place of everlasting bliss.</li><li>The places you think of as heaven could also be called ""paradise"" or ""Eden."" All of these words are based on a religious idea of heaven as a perfect, blissful existence that's granted to good people after they die. This spiritual heaven is generally depicted as the place where God lives, and is commonly described as being high in the sky. In fact, the original meaning of the Old English heaven, heofon, was ""sky.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0688,"<ul><li>If it's hard to believe and hard to wrap your head around, it just might be incredible. A hurricane in Kansas would certainly be incredible, but keeping your bedroom tidy all week counts too.</li><li>Incredible is commonplace and perhaps overused but it still fits the bill whenever life is beyond expectation. The Latin root credere means believe. Slap an in in front of that root, and something incredible is hard to believe.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0689,"<ul><li>A legend is a larger-than-life story that gets passed down from one generation to the next — like the legends of Beowulf, Robin Hood, or even Big Foot.</li><li>Legend comes from the Latin legere, ""to read."" The Latin word was originally limited to written stories, but in English, legend lost that limitation. Often a legend lives on in the stories that people tell each other. A person can be a legend too. Anne Frank is a legend for keeping a diary of hidden life in war time, and a less famous person, like a long-serving local teacher, can be a legend to neighborhood kids.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0690,"<ul><li>Praise means ""admiration or approval,"" and when you're on the receiving end of it, you feel great.</li><li>Whether it's used as a verb or a noun, praise means ""approval."" If you enthusiastically praise your dog, he's likely to wag his tail and expect a treat. What you've given him (in addition to the treat) is praise, the noun. In a religious context, the verb praise is interchangeable with worship, as when a minister says, ""Praise God.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0691,"<ul><li>To proceed means to go or continue forward. But somehow ""ready, set, proceed!"" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.</li><li>From the Latin procedere, meaning “go forward, advance,” proceed is a verb that simply means to keep going, particularly after there’s been an interruption. Synonyms include progress and advance. People who constantly interrupt make it really difficult for the conversation to proceed smoothly. And proceed with caution when crossing a busy street, but if the light turns red, you better move it fast!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0692,"<ul><li>The adjective pure describes something that's made of only one substance and is not mixed with anything else. For example, your favorite soft, warm winter scarf might be made from pure merino wool.</li><li>Anything that's uncontaminated by extra, unnecessary, or unclean substances is pure. You can swim in pure water or wear a necklace that's made of pure silver. Pure can also mean ""complete"" or ""absolute,"" especially when it describes happiness. A religious meaning of pure is ""free from sin"", good or wholesome. The Latin word purus, ""clean or unmixed,"" is the root of pure.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0693,"<ul><li>A relative is a person who is part of your family. Parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, nieces and nephews — they're all relatives.</li><li>A relative can be connected to your family through blood or by marriage. If you are a child or grandchild of Maria's, for example, you are a blood relative of her family. If you marry Maria's son, you become a relative by marriage. Relative is also an adjective that means ""estimated by comparison,"" like the steep hill that is tiny, relative to the mountain behind it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0694,"<ul><li>You can use the word senior to describe anyone who's older than you are. You might say, ""My brother is six years my senior,"" especially if you want to make him feel old.</li><li>Senior means ""older,"" but it also means ""old or aged,"" like your grandmother, who despite being a senior citizen, continues her skydiving hobby. A senior is also a student in the final year of either high school or college, or an authority: ""She holds a senior position in the State Department."" The Latin word senior means ""older,"" and it's the basis of respectful terms in many languages, like señor in Spanish and sire in French.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0695,"<ul><li>If something is silent, it is completely quiet. After your noisy houseguests leave, you'll probably enjoy being all alone in your silent house.</li><li>Sometimes a silent reading period in a third grade class truly is silent — and other times, the sound of soft giggling can be heard. People are silent when they don't speak, and a silent film has no soundtrack. You might exchange a silent message with your best friend without using words, just by raising your eyebrows or shrugging your shoulders. The Latin root of silent is silere, ""be quiet or still.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0696,"<ul><li>When things sink, they settle or drop to a lower level. If your kayak has a leak, it might fill with water and sink to the bottom of the lake.</li><li>Things can sink, like a toy octopus descending to the bottom of the bathtub or the sun appearing to sink below the horizon. You can also deliberately sink something, as when you capsize your friend's remote controlled speedboat on purpose. When sink is a noun, it's the water basin in your kitchen or bathroom. The Old English root of both kinds of sink is sincan, ""become submerged or go under,"" from a Germanic source.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0697,"<ul><li>The salesman boasted to his customer that the $1 million car was well worth the price because it was far superior, meaning of higher quality, to any car that had come before it. This car, the salesman bragged, could fly.</li><li>Superior comes from the Latin word meaning above and it literally means something that is above others in quality or status. Sometimes being superior can be perceived as a negative, as in the woman who acts superior to all of her friends, having a high opinion of herself just because she has millions of dollars in the bank after winning the lottery.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0698,"<ul><li>When you think of the word surround, think of something that's around you on all sides, like the trees that surround you in a forest or the people who surround you on a city street at rush hour.</li><li>Sometimes surround describes the position of troops that force the enemy to surrender. You can also surround your property with a fence, or surround yourself with positive people. Both of these offer a way to protect or strengthen the thing in the middle — your house or your well-being. In a movie theater that has ""surround sound,"" the audience feels like it is in the middle of the action because of the speakers placed all around the space.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0699,"<ul><li>When something's thick, it's wide from one side to the other, like a thick piece of French toast or a thick layer of snow on your car.</li><li>Thick things are broad or bulky or decidedly not thin — think of the thick slab of ice you need in order to skate safely on a lake. Thick can also mean ""dense,"" like a thick chocolate milkshake, or your sister's thick, curly hair. If the kid who sits beside you in math class sees your test grade and calls you thick, it's not a compliment: she means you're not very smart.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U05_0700,"<ul><li>To wrap something is to enclose it, like when you wrap holiday presents in glittery paper. When you're done with the presents, you can wrap yourself in a cozy blanket while you drink hot chocolate.</li><li>Wrap also has a number of noun meanings. There's the wrap you wear, which is similar to a cloak or a shawl. There's also the plastic wrap you use to cover a bowl of leftovers, and the wrap you make when you fold a tortilla around sandwich fillings. The verb wrap came first, from a root meaning ""to turn or wind."" To wrap something up also means to end it, so let's wrap up this blurb by saying, ""That's a wrap!"" — it's what movie directors since the 1920s have been saying when filming is finished.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0701,"<ul><li>Also is a word that means about the same thing as ""in addition"" or ""too.""</li><li>Also is a word used for verbal additions and add-ons. When friends are heading to the movies and you want to go with them, you might say, ""Can I also come?"" That means you want to go along, too — in addition to the rest of the group. By starting a sentence with also, you're letting the reader know you're adding a thought, as in ""I think pizza is delicious. Also, it's usually cheap and easy to eat on the run.""</li></ul>"

If you walk through a door that swings open by itself, it opened automatically.</li><li>When something is done automatically, it does it on its own, like a spellchecker that corrects your spelling automatically. In a crash, a car's airbag automatically fills with air. Many computers automatically go into rest mode (to save energy) if you don't touch them for a few seconds. Automatically can also refer to how you do something without thinking about it, like if you automatically walk into your old apartment and startle the new tenants.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0703,"<ul><li>When you're busy, you have things to do. You're occupied and probably not bored.</li><li>This word always means there's some kind of activity. When a phone line is busy, you can't get your call through. If you find the bathroom is busy, you'll have to wait it's free. When a supervisor is around, employees need to look busy. A busy intersection is loaded with traffic. If you're too busy playing basketball to finish your homework, your grades might suffer. It's good to be busy, but when people are too busy, they get stressed out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0704,"<ul><li>A can is a metal container, usually cylindrical in shape, which has an airtight seal when it's new. All kinds of goods come in cans, from fruit and vegetables to paint and oil.</li><li>The verb can means to preserve food in a can or glass jar. If your garden produces more tomatoes than you can possibly eat, you might make salsa and can it to eat all winter long. Can is also a slang word with several meanings. It means rear end, toilet, and it also means to fire someone: ""Watch out, the boss canned three people yesterday! You could be next.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0705,"<ul><li>Clear means clean and uncluttered, without distractions or confusion. If your explanation of relativity is clear, it's easy to understand. If the sky’s clear, there isn't a cloud to be seen.</li><li>As a verb, clear implies getting rid of obstacles. You can clear your head (get rid of anxiety and upsetting thoughts); clear the way (remove obstacles in your path); or clear the trees to make a clearing where you can pitch your tent. If you own your car ""free and clear,"" it's all yours — you don't owe anything on it. When you arrive in a country, you clear customs when officials check your papers and belongings and send you on your way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0706,"<ul><li>To close is to shut something or to end something. You could close a door, close your mouth, or even close a deal.</li><li>This versatile word usually means ""the end"" or ""near."" When a store is closed, you can't go in: the door is closed and locked. When people are close, they are right next to each other — or they're emotionally close to one another. In baseball, the closer is a pitcher who tries to end the game. If your flight had ""a close call,"" it almost crashed. You can close a program on a computer, and you close your eyes when you go to sleep after reading this.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0707,"<ul><li>To discuss is to talk: but with a more serious intent. Discussing is a lot more substantial than chatting.</li><li>When someone says, ""I have something I need to discuss with you,"" most people think ""Uh oh."" To discuss usually implies a certain amount of serious talking. This can apply to writing as well: essays discuss topics, usually in a careful, thorough way. On the other hand, sometimes discuss means exactly the same thing as talk or converse. Like all words, the meaning depends on how it’s used.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0708,"<ul><li>If you put your hand on someone's arm, they will feel your touch; if you give them a piece of really bad news, they will feel sad. Feel means to be aware of a physical or emotional sensation.</li><li>Feel is most often used as a verb, meaning to physically touch or grope something or to be conscious of something emotionally. There's also a noun form of feel, which describes an awareness of something or the physical property of something, like in the sentences, ""This place has the feel of a palace,"" or ""She told me it was cotton, but it has the feel of silk.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0709,"<ul><li>If you really listen late at night after everyone's asleep, you'll hear the noises your house makes — the creaking of walls and floors, the hum of the refrigerator, the banging of the radiators.</li><li>When you listen to something, you don't just hear it, but you really pay attention to the sounds. You can listen to music, listen for the sound of your guests arriving, or listen to the advice your grandfather gives you. The phrase listen in means to eavesdrop on, or deliberately overhear, a conversation. The t in the middle of the word listen is silent (you can't hear it even if you listen).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0710,"<ul><li>Meet means to interact in some way. You can meet someone at a party, you can meet another team in a game.</li><li>There are many ways to meet. You can meet with tragedy, which means to have something awful happen to you. You can meet the needs of others, which means you give them what they need. You can meet expectations on the state exam, which means you do as well as you need to pass. You can meet your friends at the mall. When you see the word meet, there’s usually a connection being made.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0711,"<ul><li>Music is the pleasing sound created by voices or instruments following some tonal structure. If  you sing, whistle, or play an instrument, you are making music. You can also write music using the specific language of notes.</li><li>In Greek mythology, the goddesses who inspired creativity were called the Muses, from the words mousikḕ téchnē (""the art of the muses”). This led to the Latin mūsica.  The word is also used in various idioms, such as ""face the music,"" which means to accept consequences, and ""making beautiful music together,"" which suggests making love.  If something is ""like music to your ears,"" you are happy to hear it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0712,"<ul><li>If something conforms to a general pattern, standard, or average, we describe it as normal, but of course that standard can change over time. What's normal today may be ""abnormal"" in the future.</li><li>The word normal comes from a Latin word normalis, which described something made with a carpenter's square. Something built this way would be normed to have angles that were perfectly aligned and fit a general pattern. This meaning eventually gave us the broader sense of fitting a pattern, standard, or average. Doctors like you to be a normal weight for your height, so you may need to grow taller to make your doctor happy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0713,"<ul><li>To be quiet means you don't make any noise. When you’re trying not to wake a sleeping lion, you will be quiet when you run by it.</li><li>The versatile quiet, which can be a noun, adjective, or verb (to quiet others), is one of those words that is best understood through its antonyms — loud or hectic. Let a marching band practice in your apartment, and you will long for a little quiet. Quiet is one of those words that thankfully follow the ""i"" before ""e,"" except after ""c"" spelling rule.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0714,"<ul><li>Relax is a verb that describes feeling less stressed out or tense. If you want to relax after a crazy day at school, you might watch TV, take a nap, or do yoga to help you unwind.</li><li>Relax can also refer to behavior that grows less formal or restrained, like a beach wedding where the bride and groom relax the usually formal ceremony by wearing casual clothing. Relax can also mean to become less tight. When you relax your grip on a pen, your hold loosens up. Relax can also refer to something that becomes less severe or strict. If your teacher would relax the attendance rules, you wouldn't keep getting in trouble for skipping class!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0715,"<ul><li>If you're tired, you probably need to sleep so lie down and close your eyes. When you wake up, you'll feel much better.</li><li>Everyone needs sleep and most of us get some at least once a day. Maybe that's why sleep is used in so many expressions. If you “sleep on it” you'll wait to make a decision until tomorrow. If you “sleep over,” you stay at someone's place for the night. A person who “lets sleeping dogs lie” knows when not to stir up trouble. If you slip into eternal sleep, you won't be needing any more naps.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0716,"<ul><li>The word stress is about pressure, whether it's pressure on a syllable of a word (TRAIN-er versus train-EE), an object (the bridge is designed to handle the stress of the cars), or a person (I am under a lot of stress).</li><li>It says something about our culture, how much we love to use the word stress and keep redefining it to mean new things. The word first appeared in about 1300, when it meant hardship or a force to which someone is subjected. In the 1890s, we stretched the meaning to include ""emphasizing something"" and, in the middle of the 20th century, started to associate it with psychological pressure.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0717,"<ul><li>It might seem as if you've gone catatonic, staring at a crack in the sidewalk for so long, but really you're observing it as closely as possible for your study of ant movement.</li><li>Study has many different senses related to learning or concentrating. You might make a drawing of something you'll paint later — the drawing's a study. Your boss might ask you to do a study of your office's energy use. As a verb, study is for the work you do in the library, or for the act of really taking something in, the way you study your friend's face to see if she really forgot your birthday or if she's just joking.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0718,"<ul><li>When you open your mouth and say something, you talk. You tell someone something, or have a conversation, or exchange information. A speech can also be called a talk.</li><li>Talk is a word that’s always connected to speaking. In a movie, a hero being tortured by bad guys might be told that they will ""make him talk,"" which means they want him to reveal secret info. Someone who is ""the talk of the town"" is being gossiped about by everyone. If someone says, ""We need to talk,"" it often means they have bad news for you. Anytime people are conversing, chatting, or blabbing, they're talking.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0719,"<ul><li>The word work has many shades of meaning, but most involve putting in an effort of some sort. You're not going to become an Olympic ice skater overnight. You'll need to do a serious amount of work to get there.</li><li>When you say you have to go to work, work is a noun meaning your workplace. The actual tasks you perform at your workplace — what you get paid for — are also called work. Your work might consist of answering the phone or baking bread or doing the accounting. Work can also be a verb describing doing some kind of activity, often one associated with your job. It's a bummer to work on Saturday when you already worked all week.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U06_0720,"<ul><li>To write is to put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard. If you have trouble falling asleep, write down all the thoughts swimming around your head before getting into bed as a way to clear your mind.</li><li>Write is the modern day spelling of the Old English writan, meaning “to score, outline, draw the figure of.” Now it has the sense of “to set down in writing.” You can write music, a short story, or computer code. You can write a letter, or write in cursive. You can write up an account of a burglary, or write down your feelings in a journal. Write on!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0721,"<ul><li>Basis is the underlying reason or assumption.  The basis of a dictionary is that people are curious to learn the meanings of new words.  You are interested, right?</li><li>Basis can also apply to a system or pattern that has been established. For example: Since your job is so exhausting, you need vacations on a regular basis.  The basis of democracy is regular free elections.  Not surprisingly, as its sense of something from which other things spring, basis comes from the Latin word of the same spelling meaning ""foundation.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0722,"<ul><li>Biology is the study of life and living organisms, from one-celled creatures to the most complex living organism of all — the human being. Biology includes the study of genes and cells that give living things their special characteristics.</li><li>You may know that the ology suffix means ""the study of,"" and the addition of the Greek bios, meaning ""life,"" gives us the meaning of biology.  According to Nobel Laureate Walter Gilbert, ""Biology will relate every human gene to the genes of other animals and bacteria, to this great chain of being.""  Sometimes science isn't as pretty as that sounds (as you know if you've cut open worms or frogs in biology class).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0723,"<ul><li>A cage is a structure that keeps an animal captive. If you decide to raise a tiger in your bedroom, it's best to have a sturdy cage.</li><li>Cage is equally at home as a noun or verb. For instance, a batting cage is fun, but a free bird does not desire you to cage it. A cage of an elevator is great to ride to the 30th floor, but not so great if you’re riding it down into the mines and it breaks 40 feet below the earth.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0724,"<ul><li>A colleague is someone you work with at your job. When you are a teacher, the other teachers are your colleagues. When you work as a cashier at 7-11, the guy at the deli counter is your colleague as well.</li><li>Your colleagues are usually people at the same level or rank as you are. You would not usually consider your boss to be a colleague. This noun is from French collègue, from Latin collega ""a person chosen along with another,"" from the prefix com- ""with"" plus legare ""to appoint as a deputy.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0725,"<ul><li>A colony is a group of people who settle in a new place but keep ties to their homeland. The people who founded the United States first came to America to live as part of a British colony.</li><li>Colony comes from the Latin colonia, meaning ""settled land, farm."" Colony can also mean ""a group of people who've gathered to live near each other and share the same interest."" An artists' colony would be a place where everyone's an artist, while a Dunkin' Donuts colony would be full of coffee lovers. The same rules apply to the animal kingdom — an ant colony has a shared interest in ruining your picnic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0726,"<ul><li>Another word for formally discuss is debate. Cheese lovers often debate the merits of gorgonzola, triple creme brie, and gouda. Of course, they need to accompany their arguments with a taste test!</li><li>A debate is a kind of respectful, well reasoned argument over opposing points of view, although tensions can run high and voices can be raised. In fact, the verb evolved from the Old French debatre, meaning “to fight.” Most formal debates, during a political campaign for example, keep the battles to a minimum. But if you find yourself in the midst of a debate between a Red Sox fan and a Yankees fan, things could get ugly!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0727,"<ul><li>To depart is to go away or to choose a different direction. If you are catching a plane, you are soon to depart. And, if you are wearing a kilt instead of jeans, you depart from your usual look.</li><li>Airports and train stations have gates for arrivals and departures. Airplanes and people coming in ""arrive"" while those going out depart. You also can depart without going anywhere, as when you change your mind and depart from an earlier decision. To ""depart from the norm"" is an expression for doing something different than expected, like giggling during a tear-jerker of a movie.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0728,"<ul><li>Depress means to lessen the activity or power of something. If you want to depress the spread of poverty, you need to find ways to slow it down, like by bringing education and skill-building resources into the poorest communities.</li><li>The word depress comes from the Old French word depresser, meaning ""put down by force."" Depress can be used literally to describe something you push down, like when you depress the handle on a toaster to lower the bread. It can also describe a more figurative lowering, such as the lowering of a person's emotional state. Attending a funeral is likely to depress you, and watching a sad movie afterwards will just sink your spirits even more.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0729,"<ul><li>If something is factual, it can be proven, like your mother's story about the bear that is factual because she took a picture of it standing next to the family car.</li><li>Something factual is real. It is based in fact, meaning it can be proven, repeated or observed. In fact, fact is the root of the word factual, from the Latin word factum, meaning ""event, occurrence."" The factual part of a story is the part that really happened — the rest gets more outlandish every time someone tells it. Evidence makes something factual.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0730,"<ul><li>Anything that sparks your interest or makes you wonder has the ability to fascinate. If you catch someone's interest, and then hold it, you fascinate them. Be careful.</li><li>The word fascinate actually comes from Latin and French words meaning ""witchcraft,"" and although these days fascinate is used under much tamer circumstances, there is some sense in the word that the person's appeal is not quite normal: there might be a spell-like quality to his or her charms. Thus, the word is often used to describe a new love. On the other hand, you might find the study of exotic beetles fascinating. To each his own.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0731,"<ul><li>A mission is a special quest, one that involves more effort than, say, a trip to the corner store. If you were to drive all around the state searching garage sales for porcelain cats, you could say you were on a mission.</li><li>Mission comes from a Latin word that means “to send.” It was first used by Jesuit missionaries who sent members of their order overseas to establish schools and churches. Foreign travel is still associated with the word. When diplomats and humanitarian workers travel abroad, we often refer to those trips as missions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0732,"<ul><li>A funny-looking adverb that appears to be made up of three words squished together, nevertheless means “even so"" or ""all the same.”</li><li>It’s likely that nevertheless evolved from the Middle English neverthelater, a word with the same sense of “despite anything to the contrary” and “notwithstanding.”  You might say of your siblings, ""Sure we bicker and get sick of each other sometimes. Nevertheless, they’re family and I love them.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0733,"<ul><li>An occupation is a physical takeover. Your student group's occupation of the college building made news when your demands became known. In exchange for leaving, you wanted the college to grant a tuition freeze.</li><li>The occupation of a building can refer to the rightful habitation by its residents or the takeover of a building, as in a protest. The occupation of a country, however, always refers to the takeover and control of one country by another, as in the German occupation of France during WWII. The noun occupation can also mean your line of work or anything that occupies your time. Some people have unusual occupations, such as alligator wrangler or golf ball retriever.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0734,"<ul><li>There's no trick to the meaning of overseas. If someone goes overseas, they've gone ""over"" the ""seas"" — to a foreign country.</li><li>When overseas came into use, there were no airplanes, so technically speaking, one traveled ""across"" or ""on"" the seas, in a ship. Nevertheless, one was thought to have made it ""over the sea,"" hence overseas. When traveling overseas, make sure your phone works on the network in the country where you're headed. Also, the laws and customs overseas can be very different from the ones we have here, so be careful. What here at home you consider small potatoes legally might be a big deal overseas.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0735,"<ul><li>If you get talked into something, you've been persuaded. If your friends try to persuade you to swan-dive into a dangerous ravine, it's time to find some new friends.</li><li>To persuade is to get your way — win the argument, convince the group to see your favorite movie, get your parents to let you borrow the car. You persuade with language, with a carefully constructed argument, and with the strength of your conviction. The word is sometimes used tongue-in-cheek to describe the very opposite of a carefully worded argument. A movie gangster might ""persuade"" people with the gun he keeps tucked in his pocket.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0736,"<ul><li>A route is a way for travel or movement, the path from point A to point B. A route can also be the method used for achieving a particular result, like going to school and working hard is your route to success.</li><li>Route comes from an Old French word, rute, “road,” “way,” or “path” and the Latin rupta, “broken way” or “beaten way.” A route can be a highway, like Route 66, or all the places you pass through on the way somewhere, like using a map to find the shortest route. As a verb, route means ""to send people or things on a particular course,"" like detour signs that route you through unfamiliar streets or a package that is routed through Cleveland on its way to you.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U07_0738,"<ul><li>Someone who learns is a scholar, though the word also means someone with a lot of knowledge in one subject. If you know a lot about books, you could be called a literary scholar.</li><li>It doesn't take a Latin scholar to understand the word scholar. It probably reminds you of school, scholastic, and scholarship. That's because they all share the Latin root schola which means school. A scholar in the academic sense usually has his or her area of specialty in the humanities as opposed to the sciences.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0739,"<ul><li>Use the adjective significant to describe something that is important. Your ""significant other"" means the person who's most important in your life. A significant result in a scientific study is a result large enough to matter.</li><li>A less common meaning of significant is to describe something that has a special or hidden meaning. A significant smile can convey feelings or information without words. This adjective is from Latin significans, from significare ""to signify,"" from signum ""a sign, mark"" plus facere ""to make.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U07_0740,"<ul><li>When the earth's crust cracks open and spews hot lava and gases, you've got a volcano on your hands. You better run.</li><li>The noun volcano comes from the name of the Roman god of fire, Vulcan. The Romans believed Vulcan had a forge in Mt. Etna, a volcano in Italy. The term can be applied to a vent in a planet's surface or crust. Lava, ash, and gas escape through the vent. The term volcano can also apply to a mountain created by such a vent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0741,"<ul><li>The adjective broad boasts an extensive — you might even say broad — array of subtly different meanings including wide, spacious, far-reaching, vague, and unsubtle.</li><li>It's kind of funny that the word broad can communicate such an expansive range of ideas since expansive is, in fact, a synonym for broad. This adjective can be used to describe actual physical spaces. A broad highway, for example, would be difficult to cross because of all the cars in the many lanes of the road. The word can also be used more figuratively. American history covers a broad range of topics and events. A broad-minded person is open to new ideas, while broad humor aims for a mass audience with obvious gags and stunts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0742,"<ul><li>A bush is a dense, woody-stemmed plant that grows much shorter and wider than a tree. You might plant a rose bush under your bedroom window.</li><li>Your yard might be full of bushes of all sorts, from spiky-leafed holly to sweet-smelling gardenia — and you could also call them shrubs. There is also the bush that means ""the wilderness"" or ""the wild country,"" which is used most often to talk about the Australian outback. This sense of ""the middle of nowhere"" led to the phrase ""bush league,"" or ""unprofessional.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0743,"<ul><li>To be capable of something is to be able to do it, like your little brother who is perfectly capable of tying his own shoes, but likes having everyone else do it for him.</li><li>When people are capable, they can handle whatever task is at hand, like a capable teacher who can explain difficult concepts and make it fun. You may also have heard that someone ""isn't capable"" of, say, committing a crime or hurting someone's feelings. In this case, not being capable is a compliment — it means you just won't let yourself do something to violate your own standards for behavior.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0744,"<ul><li>To cheat is to use sneaky, unfair methods to get something you want. No one's going to want to play with you if you always cheat at mini golf.</li><li>Some people cheat at cards, and others cheat during math tests by copying from the student beside them. In either case, they're trying to succeed using underhanded tricks. You can refer to someone who does this as a cheat as well. Cheat comes from the Old French escheat, a legal term for the state taking someone's property when he or she dies without heirs. This practice was resented, and it came to mean ""confiscate unfairly.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0745,"<ul><li>Concentrate means to make something stronger, denser, or more focused. If you concentrate your energy, for example, you become more powerful! Concentrate your efforts at digging, and you'll plant that shrub a lot faster.</li><li>You may have seen the words ""frozen concentrate"" used to describe orange juice. That can of frozen orange goo is the juice in its purest, most condensed form — the concentrate — and it's much stronger and sweeter than the juice you'd drink. Another meaning of the verb concentrate refers to your mental focus. You might need to concentrate on what you're reading in order to understand it. When you concentrate, you strengthen your focus to shut out distractions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0746,"<ul><li>The verb conclude means two related things: coming to a decision, and bringing to a close.</li><li>Conclude is related to the word close, which is related to an old Latin word for ""barrier"" or ""bolt"" — the kind you put on a door.  When you conclude something, it's as though you're pulling a door shut and bolting it. If your girlfriend concludes an argument by leaving the room and slamming the door, you can conclude that she's angry at you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0747,"<ul><li>If you're confident you are sure about something, someone, or yourself. He was confident he could keep his balance and cross the river on the skinny log, but he wasn't so confident that the log was strong enough to hold him.</li><li>Confident is often a word of assurance. Someone may ask, ""Are you sure that's the right way to do it?"" and then, just to be assured, they might say, ""So, you're confident that's the right wire to cut so the bomb doesn't blow?"" Being really sure of something or being sure of yourself is being confident. ""He held his head high, but not in an arrogant or show-off way; he was just confident about who he was. He liked himself.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0748,"<ul><li>Use the adjective considerable to describe something that is large in amount. Things you probably spend a considerable amount of time on: homework and laundry. Things you'd rather spend time on: anything that isn't homework and laundry!</li><li>The adjective considerable can describe something of importance and is worthy of notice or respect. If you are an excellent singer, dancer, musician, writer, or similar profession, people may ask you to donate your considerable talents to charitable causes. If you're not an excellent singer, dancer, musician, or writer, they will still ask you to donate, but they are more likely to ask for money!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0749,"<ul><li>When you convey something, you carry or deliver it. Little Red Riding Hood conveyed a basket of muffins to her grandmother. Your sad smile might convey more about your feelings than words ever could.</li><li>You can also convey a message or information, which means that you communicate it to someone directly or indirectly through your words or actions. In law, the word convey means to transfer or pass property to someone. This verb is from Middle English conveyen, from Old French conveier, ultimately from the Latin prefix com-, ""together,"" plus via, ""way.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0750,"<ul><li>Definite is an adjective describing something that is known for certain. For example, there is no more definite way to get into trouble with a police officer than speeding in front of the police station with a broken taillight.</li><li>This word is from the Latin definitus meaning ""defined"" or ""limited."" Definite can also be used to mean something is very clearly planned or certainly defined. If you have definite plans for the evening to go to the theater and out for a nice dinner at a steak house, you're probably not going to end up playing miniature golf and eating fast food instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0751,"<ul><li>When you like someone, you might say, ""She is an absolute delight."" You mean you think she's great: a delight is a source of joy, and to delight is to cause pleasure. Babies are particularly good at expressing delight in new things.</li><li>Delight is often associated with an initial impression—one says, ""She continues to delight us,"" to suggest that the first impression continues. The word delight derives from the Latin delectare ""to charm,"" which also gives us delectable, and the same lighthearted sense of pure, uncomplicated pleasure.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0752,"<ul><li>Destination can describe where you are going, like a traveler whose destination is Paris, or a place that is known for a particular purpose, such as a hip new music club that's a destination for fans of indie rock.</li><li>The noun destination comes from the Latin word destinare, meaning ""determine, appoint, choose, make firm or fast."" If you choose a destination, that's where you intend to end up, the ""finish line"" or goal that you keep in mind, like a friend's house that is the destination of a walk that might be interrupted a number of times, as you stop in stores along the way and pause to talk to the people you meet.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0753,"<ul><li>The place where something begins or ends is called the edge. If you get too close to a cliff’s edge, you might fall off it. Going to the water's edge is not so dangerous.</li><li>The part of a knife's blade that actually does the cutting is called the edge. Make sure you keep it sharp! This sense of sharpness is the image you want to have for the many figurative senses of this word. If someone speaks to you with an edge in his or her voice, be careful. They might be getting angry. And if you have an edge over someone, think of yourself as a little sharper because you have the advantage. Your years of training will give you the competitive edge over newcomers to the game. If your company is on the cutting edge of 3D technology, it is the industry leader.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0754,"<ul><li>You know those days when you just can’t seem to remember how to do the simplest tasks? If only everything came with instructions: a guide to operating the toothpaste tube, or a manual showing you how to pour cereal.</li><li>Instructions is related to the verb instruct, meaning “teach.” Instructions are sets of information that teach you how to do something or use something. The more we use technology to make our lives easier, the more we need to read instructions to help us learn how to use the technology. After all, you can’t let your robotic poodle-groomer loose on your poodle until you figure out how it works first.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0755,"<ul><li>A path is a route that's meant for walking. You might follow a path up a mountain as you hike, or follow a winding path throughout your life.</li><li>Paths are often created by people's feet wearing a trail into the ground or through the snow, for example. You can also create a path by laying flat stones in line through a yard or around a garden. Another kind of path is the route something takes as it moves, like a speedboat's path in the water or, figuratively, the path your life takes as you grow older.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0756,"<ul><li>The noun resort means ""turning to something or someone else for assistance."" You tried everything to figure out your math homework on your own, so asking your dad for help was your last resort.</li><li>Resort, pronounced ""re-ZORT,"" is also a verb that means ""to adopt a course of action to improve your situation."" It's when you use that last resort: if you can't convince your mom to let you go rock-climbing, you will resort to begging. Resort also means a fancy hotel, usually in a very scenic location, or a place you go often — when your friends didn't know where you were, they checked your resorts: the gym and the park.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0757,"<ul><li>A shadow is a dark shape that is formed when an object blocks a source of light. On a sunny day, practically everything casts a shadow — including you. Shadow can also act as an action, like when you shadow, or follow, someone on the first day at a new job.</li><li>Depending on its use, shadow can have negative or positive connotations. Children often play with their shadows and think of their shadows as constant companions, like in the song lyric ""just me and my shadow."" On the other hand, you could be such a wimp that you fear your own shadow or at least fear what lurks in the shadows. Used as a verb, a spy could shadow you without your knowledge. Or, your faithful dog might shadow you as you pace around the house. You might be sick and tired of living in the shadow of your older sister who always seems to be the center of attention — blocking you from the spotlight.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0758,"<ul><li>When you succeed at something, you reach a goal or do really well. If you practice speaking Arabic every day, you are likely to succeed at becoming fluent in this language.</li><li>When you succeed, you achieve the result you hope for, but another way to use succeed is to describe taking over a position. A prince who will inherit his father's kingdom will succeed his father one day, and a new high school principal can be said to succeed the old one. The Latin root of succeed is succedere, come close after.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0759,"<ul><li>A suspect is a person who is believed to be guilty of a crime. If you leave the scene of a murder with blood on your hands and a weapon in your pocket, you’re likely to become a prime suspect.</li><li>If others believe you have committed a crime, you are a suspect. The word can also be used as a verb and an adjective. To suspect someone of something is to believe that they probably did it. Do you ever suspect your parents of taking some of your Halloween candy? If something such as someone's excuse or motive is suspect, it seems a bit off. That bad-smelling piece of fish is suspect — you'd better not eat it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U08_0760,"<ul><li>If you live in a valley, you probably get more fog than they do up in the hills around you. Fog tends to be more common down in the valley, the low area that often forms near a river.</li><li>If you're into fishing, swimming, and tubing, then a valley is the place for you, because valleys usually have rivers or other streams running through them. The Napa Valley is an area in northern California that is famous for its good wine and food, though technically it's not all a valley; parts of it are quite hilly. Another famous valley, the San Fernando, lies at the foot of the hills of Los Angeles. You might have heard of the infamous ""Valley Girl."" In movies, Valley girls are usually blonde and say ""like"" and ""totally"" a lot. ""Like, oh, my God! That low, flat stretch of terrain, is like, totally a valley!""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U09_0762,"<ul><li>You know that wide, flat patch of sand that leads down to the sea, or maybe even the lake? That's a beach, one of the most beautiful places in the world. During a long, stormy winter, a beach can erode and move.</li><li>The word beach can also be used more generally to describe a town or vacation spot along the ocean or sea. In New Jersey, they call it the shore. But in lots of other places, people say they're going to the beach when they mean they are taking a trip to the seaside for vacation. Of course, if you beach your boat, you might not be overjoyed: that means you've run it aground, usually on a choice pile of sand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0763,"<ul><li>When you damage something you hurt it in a way that makes it less valuable or useful. Say you throw a baseball and it flies over your friend's head and cracks your dad's windshield. Congratulations, you've damaged your dad's car.</li><li>Damage can also be a noun.  That crack in the windshield? It doesn't matter whether you 'fess up or blame your friend or a giant falling acorn.  It made the car less valuable and harder to drive, therefore it is considered damage. Another meaning of damage implies the damage done to your wallet when you buy something. In a restaurant, you might hear someone ask ""What's the damage?"" when the check comes to the table.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0764,"<ul><li>If you discover something, you find it unexpectedly, like when you discover your favorite childhood stuffed animal in a box of old junk.</li><li>When you discover something, it can be by surprise or the result of a search. You might discover the fact that your dad used to travel with the circus as a trapeze artist or discover a band none of your friends ever heard of. Scientists often discover new substances, stars, or organisms. The Latin root discooperire, ""uncover,"" combines the prefix dis-, or ""opposite of,"" with cooperire, ""to cover up.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0765,"<ul><li>An emotion is a strong feeling, like the emotion you feel when you see your best friend at the movies with a group of people who cause trouble for you.</li><li>The word emotion comes from the Middle French word émotion, which means ""a (social) moving, stirring, agitation."" We feel many different emotions every day, like love, fear, joy and sadness — just to name a few. On its own, emotion means ""the expression of feeling,"" like a musician who plays with great emotion, or an actor whose face conveys emotions, even when he or she is just standing quietly on the stage.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U09_0767,"<ul><li>You might identify a Ming dynasty vase, a suspect in a bank robbery, or an ivory-billed woodpecker. Whatever it is, when you recognize the identity of someone or something, you identify it.</li><li>The word identify is easy to...well...identify when you notice how much it looks like the word identity (a noun, meaning who or what something is). Only one consonant separates the two words in spelling (""f"" vs. ""t""), and they are close relatives in meaning as well. You can easily remember the meaning of identify, a verb, when you recognize that it’s just a way to express the act of establishing identity — in other words, saying who or what something is.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0768,"<ul><li>An island is a piece of land that is surrounded on all sides by water. Some islands are so small that a beach chair and umbrella barely fit on them and some are big enough to contain a whole nation.</li><li>To get to an island you must take a boat, bridge or airplane — be a strong swimmer. If you can get there by land it’s not an island, though it may be a peninsula, like Florida. There are many famous islands, like Manhattan and the islands of Hawaii. Things that are free-standing can also be called islands, like the island made of cabinets and a counter that is found in some kitchens — it's not connected to anything else.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0769,"<ul><li>You know that vast, wet expanse of blue that keeps crashing waves on the beach? That's the ocean.</li><li>Atlantic, Pacific, Indian...these are just a few of the big oceans of the world. If Columbus hadn't sailed the ocean blue in 14 hundred ninety-two, America would have never been discovered. Home to sharks, mermaids, sailboats, and tsunami waves, the ocean makes up most of the planet Earth. But you can use ocean to describe anything similarly vast and limitless, like an endless ocean of fans at a rock concert.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0770,"<ul><li>Perhaps means about the same thing as maybe: things that perhaps could happen might happen, or they might not.</li><li>When someone asks if you want to do something and you say ""Perhaps"" — you haven't committed. It's another way of saying ""I don't know"" or ""It's possible. Who knows?"" People use perhaps when talking about things they aren't sure about, or things they don't want to answer in a decisive way. When a friend says, ""Perhaps we'll go to that movie,"" don't count on it. He's keeping his options open.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0771,"<ul><li>Something pleasant is nice or enjoyable. Usually, a picnic in the park is considered a pleasant activity.</li><li>Pleasant is a word for things that are pleasing: ice cream is considered pleasant by most people. A second meaning refers to a person who is polite or agreeable. People who have good manners, give compliments, smile often are considered more pleasant than someone who screams and curses all the time. This word is often used for weather: clear skies and warm temperatures are signs of pleasant weather. Still, different weather (and other things) will be pleasant to different people.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0772,"<ul><li>The verb prevent means ""to keep something from happening,"" like when you use a complicated password to prevent hackers from accessing your account.</li><li>Prevent comes from the Latin word praeventus, meaning ""to act in anticipation of,"" like when you shovel the icy, snow-covered sidewalk to prevent people from falling. Prevent can also mean ""to make impossible,"" like when a school locks the doors during a dance to prevent kids from leaving without their parents knowing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0773,"<ul><li>If you are asked to rock a baby, please do not throw a stone at it.  Instead, move the baby gently from side to side.  If this doesn't calm the child, play some loud rock music.</li><li>When rocking a baby you move gently, but when you're told not to “rock the boat” the rocking movement referred to is more violent, enough to tip the boat over.  This kind of motion has more in common with what you do when “rocking out” listening to music.  A rock is also a lump of mineral, and if we say someone is ""like a rock,"" we mean he's totally dependable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0774,"<ul><li>To save is to keep safe. So, you might save money for college, save a kitten from drowning, or save a dropped football.</li><li>You can save a choking person by giving them the Heimlich maneuver, or save a stray puppy from running into the street. There are other ways to save things, too, like when you keep them for later: ""You can eat your brownie, but I'll save mine until after dinner."" Or when you spend less money: ""I'll save by buying this at the used book store."" The Latin root is salvus, ""safe.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0775,"<ul><li>Smile is the thing you do with your face when you are happy -– or want others to think you are. Your expression softens and your mouth turns up at the corners.</li><li>Smile, noun or verb, with its universal message and association with enjoyment and pleasure, is a very useful word. It can express joy or even say hello. Of course if you “smile through your sorrows,” you are either tying to make yourself feel better or fool other people into thinking you are happy. But in general, a smile is a good sign. And as the song goes “You’re never fully dressed without a smile.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0776,"<ul><li>Step right up and learn about the word step, which can be a noun or a verb. When you lift up your foot, move it forward, and put it down, that's a step. You can call the distance you cover in that single movement a step as well.</li><li>Each movement in a dance is a step, and so is the sound of feet on the floor: ""I heard his heavy step when he went for his midnight snack."" A step is also a stair or a  ladder's rung, and when you achieve something or make progress, you take steps toward your goal. If you're about to step in gum, your friend might warn, ""Watch your step!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0777,"<ul><li>If something is quiet and calm, it's still. After the noise of the city, it's peaceful to go camping in the woods where everything is still.</li><li>Things that are tranquil are still, like the calm surface of a lake or a sleeping baby. If you stand still, you freeze in place. Another meaning of still is an individual shot from a movie, an unmoving snapshot of a single scene. When still is an adverb, it means even now, like when you say you still love an old song or you still remember the kindness of your kindergarten teacher.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0778,"<ul><li>Taste is the ability to tell the difference between flavors in your mouth. It's your sense of taste that tells you if what you're eating is salty, sweet, or sour.</li><li>The verb taste means to perceive with your sense of taste (""I tasted kiwi for the first time"") or to have a certain flavor (""the cake tastes of cinnamon and nutmeg""). The noun taste has a few different meanings. It's sensing flavors on your tongue, but it's also having a preference for something or a sense of discernment: ""She has such good taste. Her clothes are always perfect."" If you take a small sample of food, that's also a taste, as is a quick experience: ""I only had a taste of what living in Paris would be like."" Taste comes from the Old French taster, ""to feel.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0779,"<ul><li>When you throw a ball, you toss it using your hand. When you throw a party, you buy some food and drinks, then invite your friends over.</li><li>Throw means many things. You can throw a baseball game, even if you're not the pitcher, by deliberately trying to lose it. You can throw a baby off its schedule — that is, confuse the baby's waking and sleeping times. In basketball, when you get fouled and throw the ball from the free-throw line, you're taking a free throw. You can throw garbage out. Also, a throw is a small blanket you toss over a chair, much like a throw pillow.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U09_0780,"<ul><li>The word wave has many different meanings, but they all have to do with an undulating motion or shape. A wave that washes up on a beach has the same kind of back-and-forth movement as a crowd of baseball fans doing ""the wave"" in the stands.</li><li>Use the verb wave to describe a greeting that includes a hand motion, from the enthusiastic flapping wave of a little kid meeting his dad at the airport to the prim wave of a Queen acknowledging her subjects. In physics, when you talk about a sound wave, there is a similar kind of rise and fall. Two Old English root words of wave are wæfre, ""wavering or restless,"" and wagian, ""to move to and fro.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0781,"<ul><li>It's pretty hard to be on this planet and not be recognized as a citizen of somewhere. You can be a citizen of a city, a country, or the world. Citizen can mean ""an inhabitant of a particular place.""</li><li>To be recognized as an official citizen of a town, city, or country, one typically has to meet certain requirements. In return, one gets certain rights, such as the right to vote. In other uses, a citizen may just be someone who lives in a place, such as a ""citizen of the world."" That's a nice thing to be, but it's not going to get you social security payments when you retire.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0782,"<ul><li>A council is a group of people that gathers for the purpose of giving advice or making decisions. If you’re president of the student council, for example, you might organize people to get the hallways at your school painted purple.</li><li>Council comes from the Latin word concilium for ""group of people, meeting,"" which is what it basically means today. There are student councils, honor councils, or city councils, to name a few. People working together to take care of business — that’s a council. Of course, that council might give advice, or counsel (with an s) people on what to do. Not the same word  — an honor council might counsel a principal about how to address cheating in school, for example.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0783,"<ul><li>If you declare victory, you are ending a war by saying you have won. Hopefully, the other side agrees, or your troops might declare you a fool. To declare is to state clearly and officially.</li><li>In elections, the government body that counts the votes declares the winner. Until the declaration is made, the results are not official. When you are traveling, you might be asked if you have anything to declare. You're not being asked for a statement of your beliefs, rather they want to know if you bought anything taxable abroad. If you hear your grandmother say, ""Well, I declare!"" you can be sure she is shocked and offended.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0784,"<ul><li>When something is very, very, VERY big, it can be called enormous. “Good heavens, that pimple on your cheek is absolutely enormous; it covers half your face!”</li><li>The word enormous contains within it, if you look closely, the root norm, as in normal. So what you’re saying when you call something enormous is that it’s beyond what is normal; you’re trying to convey a sense of exaggerated difference. You may also have heard the word ginormous, which people try to use as enormous with a dramatic flair. But, trust us: ginormous is not a good word; it’s just a blend of two words — gigantic and enormous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0785,"<ul><li>Something extraordinary goes above and beyond what is expected. This can be good or bad. Saving a child from a burning building is an extraordinary act of heroism, but a test score of 11 out of 100 is extraordinary too.</li><li>The extra- in extraordinary means ""outside"" the ordinary. If you had to work for 10 hours on a two-page writing assignment, that means it was an extraordinarily hard assignment. Either that or you were extraordinarily slow. We often use the word extraordinary as a superlative. If your friend bakes you a cake better than any you’ve ever tasted, you could tell her it is “extraordinary.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0786,"<ul><li>Fog is a hazy, cloudy layer of water vapor very that hovers close to the ground. Driving in fog feels a bit like being inside a cloud.</li><li>Fog is just what it appears to be — a cloud lying low in the atmosphere, getting its moisture from a body of water like the ocean or a river. When fog is thick, it can be dangerous to drive in, and most cars have special ""fog lights"" to help drivers see the road. When you're deeply confused, you can call it a fog too, and when things are unclear (literally or figuratively), they're said to fog up.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0787,"<ul><li>A funeral is a ceremony to bury or cremate the dead. If you go to a funeral, wear black and try not to seem like you're having fun.</li><li>Funeral comes from the Latin root fūnus, for ""dead body,"" and so a funeral is the ritual that surrounds taking care of a dead body. Depending on the dead person's beliefs, there will often be a representative of a religion there to honor them in a traditional way. Sometimes we use funeral for dead things other than dead people. If you just gave a really bad party, you could call it a funeral for your social life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0788,"<ul><li>A giant is someone that's unusually enormous. You can also use the word giant to describe something or someone that is really big. That giant green guy over there? That's the jolly green giant. Ho ho ho.</li><li>A star basketball player might be described as a giant, or a stunningly tall redwood tree, or even a very large business. These giants come from the giants of mythology, huge creatures that are featured in fairy and folk tales and inspired by the giants of Greek myth, who were a separate race of strong, aggressive gods. The Greek root is Gigas, with the plural form Gigantes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0789,"<ul><li>An impression is an imprint, either in one’s mind or on an object. To make a good impression on your friend's parents, don't let your muddy boots leave impressions on their perfect white kitchen floor.</li><li>The noun impression comes from the Latin word imprimere, which means “press into or upon,” or “stamp.” When you press a coin into a piece of modeling clay there will be an impression, or likeness, of its design in the clay. Another kind of impression is a performance in which you act, talk, move and even attempt to look like another person, like the impression of your teacher that got you into trouble when he saw you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0790,"<ul><li>An intention is idea that you plan (or intend) to carry out. If you mean something, it's an intention.</li><li>Your goal, purpose, or aim is your intention. It's something you mean to do, whether you pull it off or not. You may have the best intention of cooking an incredible meal, but if you leave the burner on and burn the house down, you will not be remembered as an excellent chef. When a father asks his daughter's boyfriend ""What are your intentions?"" that means something specific: Does he want to marry her?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0791,"<ul><li>If you're mad about something, you've lost your temper. If you've gone mad, you've lost your mind.</li><li>Just like it's more common to be angry than to be insane, you're more likely to use mad to describe someone who's ticked off than to describe someone who has serious mental problems. If you say you're “mad about” something, you're saying you like it so much it distracts you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0792,
4000EEW_B02_U10_0793,"<ul><li>To resist something is to keep it at bay or to fend off its influence or advance. You might not be able to resist the temptation to sneak out to the dance in spite of your parents' objections.</li><li>The verb resist comes from the Latin word resistere, meaning “to take a stand,” or “withstand.” People who are able to put up a wall — be it mental, physical, philosophical, emotional, or otherwise — to defend themselves or their group against a threat can be said to resist. The Amish community is still able to resist the influence of technology. Many a child will resist the suggestion to use a napkin. You might resist a second helping of pie.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0794,"<ul><li>When you make something visible or make it public information, you reveal it. For example, if you want to plan a picnic, wait until forecasters reveal the weather that is predicted.</li><li>The verb reveal comes from the Latin word revelare meaning ""unveil,"" like when you take off your hat to reveal your new haircut, or when you reveal information about your past that will shock or amuse your friends. You might also be familiar with the noun form of reveal, makeover show-speak for the moment viewers see the newly renovated room or someone's dramatic new look, as in saving the reveal for the end of the show so people keep watching.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0795,"<ul><li>When you clear out or eliminate something you don't want, you rid yourself of it. If even one child is allergic to peanuts, a school will often rid the cafeteria of all food made with peanuts.</li><li>For years, activists have worked to rid the world of nuclear weapons, while a dieter's priority might be to rid himself of ten extra pounds. Freeing someone from something unwanted is to rid them of it, whether it's ants in their kitchen or stress about their job. In the thirteenth century, rid meant ""clear a space, set free, or save,"" from a Scandinavian root that's related to the Old Norse ryðja, ""to clear land of obstructions.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0796,"<ul><li>A sword is a weapon with a long, sharp, metal blade. If you want to dress up as a knight for Halloween, you'll definitely need a sword — and maybe a suit of armor.</li><li>Swords evolved from daggers, which, like knives, have two sharp edges instead of just one. Some time during the Bronze Age, daggers became longer and longer, eventually being classified as swords. These long, sharp weapons were used by soldiers on battlefields, and for self-defense and dueling. Sword can be traced back to a Proto-Indo-European root meaning ""to cut or pierce.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0797,"<ul><li>A tale is a story, especially one that's full of creative embellishments. You can read a tale from a book, or tell a bedtime tale to the kids you're babysitting.</li><li>Tales can be true or fictional, but they generally consist of a narrative, with a beginning and an end, made more interesting and exciting with vivid details. Some tales are meant to teach specific lessons (like your family's history or your community's values), while others simply relay a funny story. Tale can also mean ""lie,"" like when your mom asks, ""You're not telling a tale, are you?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0798,"<ul><li>A trap is something you can’t get out of. If a critter is nibbling at your cherry tomato plants, set a trap to catch the thief. (But if it turns out to be your little brother, set him free!)</li><li>If a TV character yells, ""Look out! It's a trap!"" they're dramatically warning someone about an imminent surprise attack or mean-spirited trick. Other kinds of traps include a plumbing trap, a curved pipe that traps liquid in it so that gases can't rise up into your sink, and a sand trap, the tricky hollow where your ball gets stuck on a golf course. The Germanic root word of trap literally means ""that onto which one steps.""</li></ul>"

If you invent a computer game and want to run it through a trial before releasing it, you might hire a bunch of teenagers to play it.</li><li>A trial is also a court hearing to legally determine the result of a particular case. If your cousin is arrested for stealing her neighbor's dog, she may be put on trial. This term can also be used more generically, especially to talk about something being tried in the court of public opinion. The fate of music education is on trial in many school districts facing budget cuts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U10_0800,"<ul><li>Something that's violent involves physical force or emotional intensity. If you hate violent movies, it means that you don't want to watch scenes of people being hurt or killed.</li><li>Physically violent behavior ends in someone getting hurt or something being destroyed or damaged. You can also have violent emotions, like a violent burst of anger toward the slow driver in front of you, and you can use violent to describe something that's visually intense, like a violent orange-colored minivan. The word has gained in force since developing from the Latin word violentia, which means ""vehemence or impetuosity.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0801,"<ul><li>If you pay admission, you're paying a fee in order to attend something, like an event or a movie. After you pay admission to the movie theater, you head straight to the popcorn stand.</li><li>The noun admission stems from the Latin word admissionem, meaning ""a letting in."" It often refers to a fee charged for entry, but it can also describe the process of being granted entry. The university's admission of the new student was welcome news — now he has access to the school's research facilities. An admission can also be a confession that something is true, such as your brother's surly admission that he was the one who popped your bike tire.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0802,"<ul><li>Astronomy is the science that looks up: at stars, at other planets, at solar systems, at galaxies, and at everything else in the universe.</li><li>The Ancient Greeks used the word astron for ""star,"" so it only makes sense that astronomy would involve the study or the stars (and other unearthly topics). Someone who studies or works in astronomy is an astronomer, and one of the main tools of the trade is the telescope. As telescopes get more and more powerful, astronomers learn more and more about what's going on out there, such as how old a star or planet is. If you ever wondered what's out there besides the Earth, you should learn more about astronomy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0803,"<ul><li>Blame is about being responsible for something that's bad or has gone wrong. If you have a headache, you might blame it on the heat, or on not getting enough sleep.</li><li>A person can be to blame for something. Your mom might walk into the house, see a broken lamp and blame you. Often, in official contexts, blame is ""assigned"" or ""placed."" A common complaint among younger siblings is, ""Why do I always get blamed for everything?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0804,"<ul><li>Chemistry is the science that tells us what things and people are made of; for example, that water is really H2O, two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen.</li><li>Chemistry deals with chemicals and elements, the building blocks of our world. The periodic table, that table of all of earth's basic elements — iron, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. — comes from chemistry. Chemistry explains how atoms attract each other to become molecules. We also use the term to refer to people who are attracted to each other, either as colleagues, friends or romantic partners. Movie reviewers often say that that romantic leads have ""great chemistry"" — or not.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0805,"<ul><li>Despite is used as a preposition when something happens even though it might have been prevented by something else. You might go see a movie despite hearing a negative review of it.</li><li>Despite is just one letter away from despise, and they actually share a root: the Latin verb despicere, meaning ""to look down on scornfully."" Despite came to mean ""contempt"" or ""scorn"" in English, though that use as a noun has mostly dropped out of use. The phrase ""in despite of"" gradually got shortened to the preposition despite and lost its scornful quality. If you accomplish something despite the obstacles in your way, there's no need to feel spiteful about it.</li></ul>"

It was cobbled together in 1841 by British scientist Sir Richard Own, using the words deinos, meaning ""terrible"" and sauros meaning ""lizard."" All are gone—at least in their original form, although it is thought they simply evolved into other, present-day animals. The word dinosaur is often used for someone who is old-fashioned or unable to adapt to modern times.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0807,"<ul><li>An exhibit is an item that is shown off for the public, such as a painting on display at a gallery or a historical document shown under glass at a museum.</li><li>The main thing to remember about an exhibit is that it refers to something presented formally and in a public setting. For example, if you put an action figure on a side table in your apartment and your friends come by and notice it, well, it’s just an action figure on a side table. Put that same action figure on a pedestal in a fancy gallery, arrange it just so, and voilà! It’s an exhibit. People may even look it over and discuss its meaning in hushed tones. Students of law — or people who watch a lot of TV — will know that when used in a legal context, the word exhibit can also refer to an item presented as evidence in a legal court.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0808,"<ul><li>Fame is what you have if you're a celebrity: a lot of people know who you are. A musician's fame might mean she wears sunglasses and a baseball cap to disguise herself when she's in public.</li><li>Movie stars, rock stars, well-known public figures — these are all people who have achieved some amount of fame. You may have a kind of fame in a much smaller sphere: ""She won every spelling bee in the state, which gave her some fame at her school."" Fame is an Old French word that means ""reputation or renown,"" from the Latin fama, ""rumor, reputation, or renown,"" and also ""ill-fame"" or ""scandal.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0809,"<ul><li>A forecast is a prediction of what will happen. If the weather forecast calls for sunny skies, consider leaving your umbrella at home. (But, since forecasts aren’t guaranteed to be right, don’t blame us if you get rained on.)</li><li>While often used in the context of weather, forecast can also be used for other types of predictions such as those related to financial or political outcomes. Note that a forecast is typically a prediction made by experts. So, while a financial analyst might forecast fourth-quarter profits, your prediction about whether your friend will pay back the five dollars he owes you is more of a hunch than a forecast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0810,"<ul><li>Genius is an exceptional talent or skill, something above and beyond the norm. A genius is someone who possesses this brilliance, like a child prodigy who learned the piano at age 3 and played sold-out concerts by age 5.</li><li>Genius comes from the Latin word of the same name, meaning ""guardian deity or spirit which watches over each person from birth"" or ""innate ability.""  Your genius — your superior talent — at the game of chess could make you a world champion. Your amazing genius would also make you a genius. The word can be used more lightheartedly to describe a natural ability or flair for something. You may have a genius for putting together stylish outfits.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0811,"<ul><li>Use the adjective gentle to describe something that is soothing or kind, like a person with a tender nature or the soft sound of light rain.</li><li>The word gentle traces back to the Latin word gentlis, meaning “of the same clan,” and at first the world was used to describe people belonging to distinguished families, who were seen as courteous and noble. Nowadays you’re more likely to hear the word used to refer to things that are calm, moderate, and without harshness. The word is often applied to people, but it can be used more broadly to describe anything that is mild, such as ""a gentle detergent"" or ""a gentle reminder.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0812,"<ul><li>Geography is the study of the land and how we use it. A geography lesson about your hometown would teach about the terrain, including any landforms like mountains or waterways, its vegetation, roads and other human-made developments, and its people.</li><li>Geography means ""description of the earth's surface."" It is often confused with a related word, geology, which means ""study of the earth."" Geography is about anything that happens on the ground, or above it, including how people live and use the land, while geology studies the earth's content, like the plates that form it and how they move.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0813,"<ul><li>To interfere is to try to stop something from happening. If you get into a fight on the street, people passing by might try to interfere so no one gets hurt.</li><li>Many countries resent it when other countries interfere (get involved) in their internal affairs, just as people often dislike it when others interfere in their personal affairs. In this sense interfere is the opposite of minding one's business. On airplanes you're not allowed to use cellphones because, it's said, they interfere with the plane’s navigational systems.</li></ul>"

Is your principal goal for the summer to have fun or to earn some extra money?</li><li>The word, principal, comes from the Latin principalis ""first in importance"" and is related to the title of prince. You can see the relation when you think about its meanings — the head of a school, the starring actor in a film, and the client of an agent. Don't confuse principal with its homophone principle, a moral rule or law of nature. If you talk about a country's principal exports, you mean the main ones.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0816,"<ul><li>A row is a straight line of something, like a row of penguins at the zoo, tulips planted in a row in a garden, or a row of tuba players marching in the Fourth of July parade in your town.</li><li>A row is anything that's lined up, from the row of stitches on your knitting needle to the row of numbers on your spreadsheet. Row is also a verb meaning ""to paddle."" Row also means a noisy argument, but when you use it this way, it rhymes with cow, rather than toe. The origin of this last meaning is uncertain, but it probably came from the word carousal, or ""drinking bout,"" as a kind of British university slang.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U11_0818,"<ul><li>When your sister told you that you looked terrible in your new tube top, she may have been saying it out of spite, or in a deliberately mean or offensive way.</li><li>The noun spite means ""a desire to offend."" The word spite can also take the form of a verb, when it's used like this: ""He only became a vegetarian to spite his cattle rancher father."" Either way, spite implies a grudge, a desire to offend or hurt the feelings of someone by actions or words.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U11_0819,"<ul><li>When something is extraordinary, it’s super, like a movie that couldn't possibly be better or the super grade you got on your test: A+.</li><li>The adjective super is an abbreviated use of the prefix super-, which comes from the Latin super-, meaning “above,” “over,” or  “beyond.” Super is another way to say ""the best"" — you are above the rest. Super can also describe something that's really big: the supermarket came along after little neighborhood shops; supermarkets are huge in comparison.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U12_0821,"<ul><li>If you abuse someone, it means you are hurting that person, mentally, emotionally, or physically. If someone else is harming you, you are yourself suffering from abuse.</li><li>The word abuse is made up of two parts — ""use,"" which means to employ, and ab-, a Latin prefix meaning ""away"" — and as a whole comes from the Latin abūsus, meaning ""misuse,"" or ""use wrongly."" It began as a verb and became a noun in the mid-15th century. Abuse also refers to anything that is employed improperly or to excess, such as the abuse of alcohol or drugs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0822,"<ul><li>To afford means you have enough money or time for something. If you only have ten dollars on you, you can't afford to buy a twenty-dollar hat.</li><li>Afford is a verb that has to do with means. You either have a surplus and therefore can afford something, or else you have a deficit and can’t. It can be in the monetary sense: ""$100 for cashmere socks? I can’t afford that!” It can also refer to time: “Since my train wasn't scheduled to leave for another hour, I could afford to wait for my sister ten more minutes.” Or even access: “The castle walls afforded a wonderful view of the moat.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0823,"<ul><li>To bake something is to cook it in a hot oven. When you bake a batch of blueberry muffins, your whole house smells delicious.</li><li>Whether you bake some cookies for dessert, a casserole to take to a potluck supper, or bake a clay pot in a kiln, you cook with a relatively slow, dry heat. You can also use the word bake figuratively: ""Are you going to move into the shade, or are you just going to bake in the sun all day?"" The Old English word was bacan, from a Germanic root.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0824,"<ul><li>A bean is a seed you can eat. You might love garbanzo beans but detest large, green lima beans.</li><li>When you order rice and beans at a Mexican restaurant, you get a plate full of deliciously spiced, slightly mashed pinto or black beans. You might plant beans in your garden, vine-like climbing plants that grow pods with beans inside. Coffee and chocolate are both foods that start out as beans. If someone beans you during a softball game, it means they hit you with the ball, usually in the head — also colloquially called a bean.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U12_0826,"<ul><li>Think of the word convert as meaning ""change,"" whether it is a person who adopts a new belief, or a changing action, such as when you convert dollars into euros.</li><li>Many times we can catch a word's meaning by looking at its origins. In this case, the Latin con means ""around,"" while vertere means ""turn."" So we can figure that convert means to ""turn around,"" an object or one's thoughts on an idea. For example, you might convert a meat eater into a vegetarian or an empty-nester might convert the kids' bedroom into an exercise room.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0827,"<ul><li>The noun debt refers to an obligation to pay for or do something. If you get arrested for stealing, serving time in jail is the way to repay your debt to society.</li><li>Debt comes from the Latin word debitum, which means ""thing owed."" Often, a debt is money that you must repay someone. Debt can also mean the state of owing something — if you borrow twenty dollars from your brother, you are in debt to him until you pay him back. If someone says, ""I owe you a debt of gratitude,"" it means you have done something great and that person intends to do something to ""repay"" your kindness.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0828,"<ul><li>Decrease means to lower or go down. If you are driving above the speed limit, you should decrease your speed or risk getting a ticket. Students always want teachers to decrease the amount of homework.</li><li>The opposite of decrease is increase, which means to raise. In science, you often are measuring increases and decreases. Is there a decrease in the time it takes water to boil when you begin with water as a liquid rather than water in its ice-cube form?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0829,"<ul><li>A fault is an error caused by ignorance, bad judgment or inattention. If you're a passenger, it might be your fault that your friend missed the exit, if you were supposed to be watching for it, not sleeping.</li><li>Fault can mean ""blame"" — as a noun or verb. If you say, ""It's my fault,"" you accept the blame. Well, they can't fault you for telling the truth, at least.  A fault can be a shortcoming — everyone has faults because no one is perfect — or a crack in the earth's crust, like the San Andreas Fault. In sports like tennis, a fault is an illegal hit of the ball, usually when it lands outside the playing area.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0830,"<ul><li>A fund is a supply of money to be used for a specific purpose. You can start a fund for almost anything, such as your child’s education, a new car, or the establishment of the world’s largest origami collection.</li><li>Fund can be used as a verb meaning “provide funds for something.” If you’re unable to save up the money to start your origami collection, you might ask a friend to fund it. (We predict she’ll say no.) An organization that raises money for a particular, often charitable, purpose can also be called a fund. We doubt an origami collection warrants its own fund, but there's no harm in trying.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0831,"<ul><li>Generous people are the ones who give more than is expected of them. It's generous of your friend to take the couch and let you sleep in the bed when you stay over at her place. She didn't have to do that.</li><li>When you decide to go one step beyond what's expected of you, you're being generous. A generous helping of food is a bigger than expected scoop of mashed potatoes. A generous teacher is one who volunteers to stay after school to help you with your homework. Be generous yourself: don't forget the letter o when you spell the word generous. Just think of it as a generous act, throwing that extra letter in there.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0832,"<ul><li>An ingredient is one part of a mixture. For example, if you're making chocolate chip cookies, flour is just one ingredient you'll need.</li><li>Ingredient comes from the Latin word ingredientem, meaning ""that which enters into."" It's not just for cookies. If you're in the lab mixing a chemical compound, you carefully add one ingredient after the next and record the results (and hope nothing blows up). It's also an element or factor of something, such as how that song you wrote has all the ingredients to be a sure-fire hit! Remember that it ends in -ent, since often what you Eat has ingrediEnts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0833,"<ul><li>To insist on something is to demand or swear to it. You can insist that you didn't eat the last piece of cake, and then insist that your brother show your mom the bits of frosting on his fingers.</li><li>The verb insist comes from the Latin insistere, meaning “persist,” “dwell upon,” or “stand on.” To insist on something, like a room with a view, is to say that you must have it. To insist that you never met that man before in your life — even though there's a picture of the two of you together — is to claim that you're telling the truth. To insist on tapping your foot on the chair leg is annoying.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0834,"<ul><li>A mess is a generally dirty state, like your bedroom, your hair, or anything else that's untidy. If you make a huge mess when you cook, you probably try to get someone else to do the clean-up.</li><li>In addition to describing a jumble of stuff, mess can describe a confused or difficult situation, like the mess your finances are in if you have seven credit cards. When you mess something up, you cause disorder and maybe even wreck something, like a friendship you messed up by gossiping. And you might eat in a mess hall, a cafeteria for members of the armed forces — and it's probably very neat and orderly, not messy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0835,"<ul><li>Metal is a shiny, hard, solid material, such as iron or aluminum. If, when you smile, you flash a brilliant metal grin, it's probably because of your braces.</li><li>The Greek root metallon originally meant quarry or mine, and later came to also mean metal. Silver jewelry is made of metal, and so are things like car engines and tin cans. The genre of rock music popularly known as metal gets its name from the heavy sound, especially of the guitar solo, played on electric guitars — made of metal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0836,"<ul><li>A monitor is a device or a person who watches or checks to see that all is going well. If you're babysitting, you might use a baby monitor so you can hear if the baby cries in its sleep.</li><li>Monitor can be used as a noun or a verb, both of which are concerned with watching over someone or something. A heart monitor displays the rhythm of your heart. A hall monitor is a person who checks to see that students aren't wandering the halls. If you are monitoring your grades, you are keeping track of them to see if they go up or down. And some parents buy a program that will monitor your Internet use, though you might think that this is an invasion of privacy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0837,"<ul><li>To oppose something is to go against it or fight hard to stop it. A senator might oppose a bill, or a teen might oppose authority.</li><li>Words starting with opp-,  like opposite, opponent, and oppose, usually hint that there's a disagreement somewhere. You might oppose a decision if you don't agree with it or if it's the opposite of what you believe or know is right. Sometimes, though, to oppose just means to be on the other team.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0838,"<ul><li>Passive is the opposite of active. In English class, you might be advised to avoid the passive voice. In chemistry, a passive substance doesn't react. Passive resistance is a way to protest peacefully.</li><li>When you're passive, you don't participate much and you're not very emotional. In chemistry, passive means to be ""unreactive except under special or extreme conditions; inert."" Gandhi used the term passive resistance in the mid-twentieth century to describe the nonviolent approach Indians should use in their quest to become an independent nation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0839,"<ul><li>Quantity tells you “how much.” If you're concerned with quantity not quality, it's more important how many you have than how good they are.</li><li>If you get confused about quantity vs. quality, remember that quant is close to count. In Latin, quantus means “how great” or “how much.” When you count how many oranges are in a bowl, you know the quantity. When you count the grains of sand in a desert, you're counting a very large quantity . . . and you need a new hobby.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U12_0840,"<ul><li>If you sue someone, you're accusing them (in court) of doing something wrong or illegal and demanding that they pay for it. Almost every time someone sues, they're looking for money.</li><li>One of the last things you want to hear is ""I'll sue you!"" People sue for a lot of reasons. If you slipped on the ice, you could sue the sidewalk owner for not putting salt down. If you were in a car accident, you could sue the other driver. Years ago, someone sued McDonald's for scalding themselves on a cup of coffee they said was too hot. Sometimes it seems like people will find any reason to sue.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0841,"<ul><li>When you want to say that something is enough or good enough for a particular need, use the adjective adequate. You might have an adequate amount of flour for a batch of pancakes, but not a lot extra.</li><li>Adequate can also describe something that is acceptable or satisfactory, but not any better than that. You might say that a student's grades are adequate but need improvement. This word is from Latin adaequāre""to make equal,"" from the prefix ad- plus aequare ""to equal.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0842,"<ul><li>Anxiety is the vague, uneasy feeling you get when you're dreading something. Anxiety can also be a permanent state of nervousness that some people with mental illnesses experience, a milder version of panic.</li><li>When a scary or unpleasant event is looming, like getting a family portrait taken the year you have braces, you might feel some anxiety. You might also feel anxiety about passing chemistry, especially if you’ve skipped a lot of classes. Someone who suffers from a mild or severe mental illness might feel anxiety all the time. Deep breathing, playing relaxing music, and medication have all been known to help reduce anxiety.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0843,"<ul><li>An army is an organized group of fighters, especially a country's official military force. When a country goes to war, it sends an army to fight.</li><li>An army is typically defined as fighting on land, while a navy battles at sea, and some countries make this even more clear by distinguishing their ""Land Army"" from their ""Air Army."" The 14th century meaning of army was ""armed expedition,"" from the Old French armée and the Latin root armata, ""armed, equipped, or in arms.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0844,"<ul><li>A billion is 1,000,000,000. There are over 7 billion people in the world, the last time we checked.</li><li>While billion may sounds like a made-up number like zillion — which just means a lot — it's a very real number, specifically 1,000,000,000. That's a pretty hard number to imagine, but one way to think of it is as a thousand millions. If you have a billion dollars, you're very rich: a billionaire. Money spent by the government is often measured in billions. In England, this word often refers to a different number: 1,000,000,000,000, or one million millions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0845,"<ul><li>When you cut a design into a piece of wood or marble, you carve it. Headstone engravers carve people's names and the dates of their births and deaths into gravestones.</li><li>You might carve your initials into the tree in your backyard, or carve a walking stick out of a large branch. Some artists work by carving shapes from clay or granite, and a chef learns to carve, or precisely cut up, large cuts of meat and poultry. The Old English root word is ceorfan, ""to cut, slay, carve, or engrave.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0846,"<ul><li>To consult is to give or get help or advice. When you don't know the meaning of a word, you consult a dictionary. That's why you're here, right?</li><li>People making a big decision will usually consult their family and friends. To consult can also mean a type of professional advice: a consultant is a freelance worker paid to help a business out with something. Consulting is a complicated word that can mean to give or receive advice. When in doubt, find someone you trust to consult.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0847,"<ul><li>When there's an emergency, the stakes are high and you may need to act quickly. There's a tornado!  Someone's collapsed! The cat's stuck in a tree! It's an emergency! Call 911!</li><li>You can see the word emerge in emergency, and an emergency suddenly emerges — it happens all of a sudden and can take you by surprise. Governments declare a ""state of emergency"" if there is a disaster that they can't handle, and they need support. If you hear sirens and see flashing lights, there's probably an emergency . . . unless you're in a dance club.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0848,"<ul><li>A fortune can be a large amount of money, and fortune is a form of fate. So you want to have the good fortune to make a fortune during your career.</li><li>Fortuna was the Roman goddess of fate and luck. She was sometimes depicted with a wheel, and the random spinning of her ""wheel of fortune"" became a symbol for the unpredictability of fate (and, much later, the title of a popular game show). A fortune teller can look into her crystal ball or tarot cards and predict your future. But her predictions are probably about as accurate as the ""prophecy"" that comes inside your fortune cookie.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0849,"<ul><li>To guarantee is to promise or to a make binding agreement. If a baseball player guarantees his team will win the World Series, he better not lead the league in strikeouts.</li><li>Guarantee is a word that is both a noun and a verb: the noun means ""a binding agreement"" and the verb is the act of making that agreement. This word seems to have come from garante, the Spanish word for ""protect"" and it's related to the Old French word warrant, which means ""to authorize."" Today, we often come across guarantee in advertisements, and you might wonder how they might guarantee to make your social life better if your teeth are whiter!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0850,"<ul><li>The first letter of your name is your initial. The first thing you say to someone is your initial greeting. Initial is something that occurs first or at the beginning.</li><li>If someone asks you to initial a form, they're asking you to sign by writing your initials on it. If your name is Inna Instant, you would write I.I., and you'd probably write it really quick! The first draft of a paper might be called your initial pass at getting your ideas down. If you say that these are your initial ideas, it implies that you will be coming up with more.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0851,"<ul><li>Intense means strong or extreme. If you accidentally spill a cup of hot coffee on yourself, you’ll probably feel intense heat, intense pain, and — if anyone happened to be watching — intense embarrassment.</li><li>When using intense, we often refer to a specific feeling or emotion, as in the case of “intense dread” or “intense happiness.” Intense can also be used to describe exciting experiences as well as people with strong or insistent personalities. For example, if your intense friend insists on taking you bungee jumping, you’re guaranteed to have an intense experience.  Intense comes from a Latin word meaning “stretched,” implying that something has been stretched to its maximum limit.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0852,"<ul><li>When you lend something, you loan it or let someone borrow it. You might, for example, lend your bike to your brother — if he promises to be careful with it.</li><li>Libraries lend people books, and car rental companies lend people cars — in both cases, the item that's been borrowed is supposed to be returned eventually. Another way to lend is to ""add a quality to,"" or ""be suitable for."" You could say that you think your hat lends you a mysterious quality, or that your trench coat lends itself to walking through a foggy city at dusk.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0853,"<ul><li>Use the word peak to refer to the pointy top of something, such as the jagged peak of a tall mountain or the tapered peak that forms when you beat egg whites for a recipe.</li><li>Peak is one of those words that can play a variety of roles in a sentence. The noun peak can refer to something that is a literal highpoint, like that snow-covered peak over there in the distance, but you will also hear it used to refer to more abstract high points, such as a time of greatest success (""at the peak of your career"") or top performance (""the stock price reached a peak over the summer"") or highest level (""the peak of the flu season""). The word also has a verb form (""Don’t peak too soon"") and an adjective form (""peak productivity"") that carry similar meanings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0854,"<ul><li>If you can describe something as possible but not yet actual, choose the adjective potential. Companies try to reach potential customers through advertising.</li><li>Potential, from the Latin potentia ""power,"" sounds more complicated than it is. It describes something or someone that has the power to become something. A potential success is not yet a success but could be if circumstances are right. When a situation has the potential for disaster, it could turn bad easily. You have potential if you have a natural but undeveloped ability to do something and a building with potential will be really nice once it's fixed up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0855,"<ul><li>The noun pride describes a feeling of happiness that comes from achieving something. When you do a good job or finish a difficult task, you feel pride. Pride can also have a negative meaning and refer to exceedingly high self-regard.</li><li>If you know someone with the negative kind of pride, you might notice that his pride makes it hard for people to like him. Pride can also refer to the standards you have for yourself — your dignity. For example, you might have too much pride to ask for help when you need it. Pride also acts as a verb meaning ""be proud of."" You might pride yourself on being punctual, or pride yourself on always having a daring, trendsetting haircut.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0856,"<ul><li>Proof is the evidence that shows something is true or valid. When you show the logical steps that take you from your hypothesis that the world is round to the conclusion that it is, you're formulating a proof.</li><li>Photographic prints that haven't been touched up are also called proofs, and that’s also what you call the first copy of a printed text, before it's checked for errors and corrected. When you check a text for errors, you're proofing. If your poker strategy is foolproof, even somebody who knows nothing about poker — a poker fool, that is — can’t get it wrong. Proof is a word you’ll see on bottles of alcohol, too: 90-proof rum means it's 45% alcohol.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0857,"<ul><li>To quit means to stop doing something. You might quit a lousy job or quit eating dessert.</li><li>The verb quit can also mean to leave a place or depart from a location. This meaning isn't used as frequently in conversation now as it used to be, but you can still use it to mean leaving somewhere. For example, if you choose to move from sunny California to Maine because you think you'll like the seasons better, you could say you plan to quit California for a colder climate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0858,"<ul><li>When you spin, you whirl around in a circle. Many kids love to spin on a merry-go-round.</li><li>You can spin in a happy circle, and you can describe this movement as a spin. Another way to use the word spin is for a deliberate twisting of information, especially when it's done by politicians. A candidate might spin a news report to make herself look more appealing, for example, or spin bad news to make it appear good. This meaning of spin is relatively new, not being used much until the mid-1980's.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0859,"<ul><li>Tiny means very small. Atoms are tiny. Hawaii is tiny, in comparison to the continental US. If you wear a size five shoe as an adult, you could be said to have tiny feet.</li><li>Throughout the world there are stories about tiny mythical heroes, such as Tom Thumb, a tiny baby, who grew into a tiny child then a man so tiny he was no larger than an average man's thumb. One of the things that people love about doll houses are seeing all the artifacts we live with day to day replicated in miniature, or tiny, form.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U13_0860,"<ul><li>A tutor is someone who gives private instruction: tutors teach one-on-one.</li><li>If you ever helped someone learn something, you could say you tutored them. ""Tutor"" is also the title of someone who works with students one-on-one. There are writing tutors, music tutors, math tutors, and history tutors. You can find a tutor for just about anything you'd like to learn. Tutoring also sometimes means being the guardian for someone. In all cases, tutors tend to be helpful to their tutees: the people they tutor.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0861,"<ul><li>Apparent means obvious, but — and this is confusing — it can also mean something that seems to be true but isn't definite. ""The train's arrival is apparent — it's in the station — but apparently my friend missed it because she is not getting off.""</li><li>It makes sense that apparent has the same ancient root as appear because it's about what is plain to see. Its subtle power of suggestion, however, is wonderfully useful. The ""heir apparent"" technically means next in line, but the ink isn't dry. The power of apparent is that it leaves the door open for a little ambiguity. Maybe the heir apparent will be the next king, or maybe he'll be overthrown in a bloodless coup by his apparently more ambitious cousin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0862,"<ul><li>Someone who's blind can't see. People who are blind can often get around easily with the aid of a cane and sometimes a service dog.</li><li>You might get hit by a baseball and end up blind in one eye, or be temporarily blind after a trip to the eye doctor. The word also means ""without looking,"" as in a blind taste test of three different brands of chocolate milk. A figurative way to be blind is to refuse or be unable to see the truth: ""He was blind to the reality of the situation."" This tendency can be called a person's ""blind side.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0863,"<ul><li>To calculate is to compute, by figuring out a mathematical equation or a situation. You can calculate your monthly student loan payments, or calculate the risk of not paying them on time.</li><li>Calculate derives from the Latin word for ""count."" When you calculate, you either count something up or calculate on something happening. You might be able to calculate the answer to a simple equation in your head but need a calculator to figure out a more complex problem. And when someone is calculating, they are scheming or conniving, always figuring out the fastest way to get ahead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0864,"<ul><li>When you chat, you have a brief, casual conversation. You might chat with your mail carrier when she delivers a package to your door.</li><li>If you're in a talkative mood, you can chat with your roommate, the bus driver, your boss, and a drugstore cashier all before lunchtime. The conversation that happens when you chat is also called a chat: ""Let's sit down and have a chat sometime this week."" The earliest meaning of chat was ""frivolous talk,"" which now is more likely to be called chatter or chitchat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0865,"<ul><li>To commit is to fully dedicate yourself to something.  To commit  yourself to being the coolest kid on the beach means spending hours at the mall trying on trunks and flip-flops.</li><li>Commit can also mean ""perform an act"" — often the kind that can get you in trouble.  Just ask anyone who's committed theft, or arson, or vandalism. If you are committing another person, that means you are sending that person to an institution. Someone may be committed to prison, or to a psychiatric hospital for treatment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0866,"<ul><li>To compose is to put something together, like a song, poem, or even yourself. You might want to compose yourself before returning to the party after a good cry.</li><li>The word compose began with the Latin ponere, which means ""to put, place,"" referring to placing or arranging any piece of work. It's been in the music business since the 1590s, and it's generally still used to describe the act of writing songs. But you can use it whenever you're pulling something together: you might compose an essay for English class, or notice that the class is composed of all girls.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0867,"<ul><li>A dormitory is a building at a boarding school, college, or university where students live. Many students have roommates in a dormitory, and sometimes those roommates put up really cheesy posters of shirtless guys leaning on cars.</li><li>The word dormitory is from the Latin dormitorium for ""sleeping place,"" and if you keep going back you get to dormire for ""to sleep."" A dormitory is where students who live at school sleep — well, it’s where their beds are anyway. Often the first time kids sleep away at school is when they go to college. 
There are often different dorms for freshman and older students. Dormitories are also called dorms, residence halls, and student residences.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0868,"<ul><li>The noun exhaust refers to what comes out of your car's tailpipe. It consists of the burned gases and particulate matter that are created by the engine. As a verb, the word exhaust means to use something up, such as a food supply or your energy.</li><li>The exhaust system in your car is the part that takes the waste created by the car in the form of gas or smoke and expels it through the tailpipe. The noun exhaust appeared in the 19th century, after the invention of the engine. Before that, the word, as a verb, referred only to depleting something, such as a natural resource. Miners deplete a mineral deposit and exhaust the resource.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0869,
4000EEW_B02_U14_0870,"<ul><li>To ignore something is to disregard it. If you ignore the rules of grammar, you're likely to be misunderstood.</li><li>It's easy to see the relationship between ignore and a word such as ignorant. To be ignorant of something is to know nothing about it. A good way to be ignorant about something is to ignore it. In other words, if you want to be ignorant about a certain subject—that is, if you want to know nothing about it—then by all means ignore it. Pay it no mind.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0871,"<ul><li>Something obvious is plain to see and easily understandable. It was obvious that you didn't enjoy your meal because I found it rolled in a napkin and shoved under the rug.</li><li>There's nothing vague about the adjective obvious — it's right there in front of your eyes! It describes something that's easy to figure out or the most straightforward option. If someone states the obvious, you're likely to respond with a sarcastic ""No duh!"" or ""Thanks Sherlock."" If obvious isn't the obvious word of choice, you can try a synonym such as ""evident"" or ""apparent.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0872,"<ul><li>Physics is a kind of science, specifically the science of matter and energy and how they interact.</li><li>Physics is the study of physical matter, energy, and how they work together. Kinetic energy and potential energy are part of physics. Although it may sound really advanced — and it is — physics is involved in everything we do. Champion pool players have a good understanding of how physics influences the movement of the balls. People who design roller coasters better know their physics. And if you've ever rigged up a pulley or a lever, then you've done basic physics.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0873,"<ul><li>If a friend asks you to invest in her new start-up in exchange for a portion, or part, of the company’s profits, consider the agreement carefully. Remember, a portion of zero is still zero.</li><li>Portion can also refer to the amount of food provided for each person at a meal. If you’re reviewing a restaurant, for example, you'll want to take note of the portion size. In addition, portion can be used as a verb meaning “divide and distribute something.” At birthday parties, we find it odd that the person celebrating her birthday is expected to perform the annoying task of portioning her own cake (perhaps it’s so she can claim the biggest portion).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0874,"<ul><li>To remind is to cause someone to remember, as when George Orwell writes, ""The aim of a joke is not to degrade the human being, but to remind him that he is already degraded.""</li><li>In remind, which appears in the early 17th century, the re-, of course, means ""again,"" so the word can be thought of as ""to mind again,"" or ""think again,"" meaning to put something in someone's mind, to make them remember.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0875,"<ul><li>If you handle the correspondence and clerical work for your boss or your company, you are a secretary. One of your duties as a secretary is to open the mail.</li><li>Today, the preferred term for the kind of secretary who works in an office is administrative assistant. The noun secretary can also refer to the person who is in charge of an administrative department in the government, like the Secretary of Defense. A secretary can also be a piece of furniture — specifically, a type of writing desk.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0876,"<ul><li>Whether you're talking about a punishment, the weather, or how bad your flu is, severe indicates that it's at the limit of the spectrum.</li><li>The austerity of a word like severe serves many purposes. The common usage is to describe tough or painful stuff, like icy snowstorms, merciless punishments, or grim conditions (e.g., a severe depression). If things are severe, they're serious. Severe could also describe a person's haircut if it's brutally short and angular, or their wardrobe if it tends to be all black with no flourishes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0877,"<ul><li>If you are especially good at something, you have a talent. You can have a talent for singing or a talent for getting others to talk about themselves. People who work in creative professions are often called ""the talent.""</li><li>In Biblical times, a talent was a unit of money, and a New Testament parable tells of a master punishing a servant for hiding, rather than investing, a bag of talents in the master's absence. The interpretation of this parable to mean that you should not hide your ""God-given talents"" has led to the current meaning of the word as the special qualities a person possesses.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0878,"<ul><li>A thesis is the most important or foundational idea of an argument. If the thesis of your paper is that chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla, you'll need to back that up with plenty of sundae-based research.</li><li>The noun thesis has more than one important sense to it. One definition of thesis is that it is the most important or foundational idea of an argument, presentation, or piece of writing. But it can also mean a large work of art, criticism, or scientific research that represents original research and is generally the final requirement for an academic degree.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0879,"<ul><li>Uniform means the same. If your school has a uniform it means all the kids wear the same clothes. If you are told to make your handwriting uniform, they want your letters to be the same shape and size over and over.</li><li>When you break uniform down, you'll see uni for one, and form, for shape––things that are uniform have the shape. If you are building a Zombie Army, it's more fun to create zombies who are not uniform. Some can wear shredded shrouds, others can wear whatever they find. Some walk just fine, others leave body parts wherever they go.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U14_0880,"<ul><li>If you are getting your eyes checked, a doctor is checking on your vision — or your ability to see. But if you have visions of unicorns romping over rainbows, that's a whole other issue that the eye doctor can't address.</li><li>The noun vision describes how well you can see, but it can also refer to things you may see, but that aren't physically there. Sometimes people claim to have religious visions of God, angels, the Virgin Mary, and so on. The word can also be used to describe something that is lovely: ""The bride was a vision in white.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0881,"<ul><li>To absorb is to take in or suck up like a sponge. If you don't hear your mother calling because you are reading, you could say you were absorbed in the book.</li><li>If your parents buy groceries for a party you are throwing and don't make you pay, you could say that they decided to absorb the cost of the food. Young minds absorb information easily. The word, absorbent, describes something that is capable of absorbing something else. When you go swimming on a chilly day, it's best to carry an absorbent towel so that all of the water is absorbed from the surface of your skin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0882,"<ul><li>A boss is an authority figure, often the person who tells you what to do at work. If you work as a waiter, your boss might be the restaurant manager.</li><li>A boss at a job might hire you, give you feedback on your work, or tell you what your responsibilities are. If someone is in charge of a group, you could describe that person as a boss as well: ""She's the boss of the French club — she tells everyone what to do."" To boss someone is to do just this, order them around. Boss comes from a Dutch root, baas, ""master.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0883,"<ul><li>Something that's charitable has to do with helping people who need assistance. A charitable act might include volunteering at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter.</li><li>A charitable donation is money you give to an organization that helps needy people — and the organization itself is also charitable. You can also use the word to describe, more generally, someone who's kind and generous, or the quality of giving people the benefit of the doubt: ""He always had such a charitable opinions of me."" Charitable comes from charity, from the Old French charité, ""mercy or compassion.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0884,"<ul><li>A committee is a group of people who come together to work on a project. Members of a committee commit their efforts to accomplishing a particular task, which can be anything from throwing a party to ending a war.</li><li>You could join the Committee to Protect Groundhogs, Bumblebees and Chickadees (yes, there really is one), or you might aspire to a committee that debates questions of national importance. Committees are often subgroups of larger bodies, and the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Agriculture, which focuses on issues in the farming and poultry industries, is a good example. Committee members become experts on issues in agriculture and the group can then make informed decisions efficiently.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0885,"<ul><li>When you and someone else have agreed on something and that agreement is both binding and enforceable by law, you have a contract. When you rent an apartment, you and your future landlord sign a rental contract.</li><li>You can also use the word in this sense as a verb meaning ""to hire."" Wouldn't you like to contract someone to clean your room for you? In other verbal uses of contract, place the accent on the second syllable — kun-TRAKT. If you contract a disease, you catch it, but only use this if it's something serious. You catch a cold, but contract malaria. Contract also means ""shrink."" When the economy contracts, consumers stop buying things, and people lose their jobs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0886,"<ul><li>A crew is an organized group of workers. A crew might keep a ship sailing smoothly or pave a road smoothly. Either way, crew implies cooperation among workers.</li><li>If you're hired as a member of a ship's crew, it will be your job (along with the other crew members), to keep the boat running smoothly, and the passengers happy and well-fed. Crews are usually a group of people who work together on a ship, airplane, or movie — but the word is also a slang term for a group of friends who hang out together — like a crowd or posse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0887,"<ul><li>Devote means to give to. If you devote yourself to jump-roping, you might be found in your driveway every free moment of the day practicing.</li><li>Nuns and priests are said to devote their lives to God. A knight in shining armor devotes himself to his lady. If you devote as much energy to your school work as you do to your hair, your grades should improve. If our country devoted to education even half of the resources we pour into defense, we could eliminate poverty.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0888,"<ul><li>When you dig, you scoop or shovel up dirt, sand, or some other material. Your dog might whine to go outside so she can dig a hole in your dad's garden.</li><li>You can dig with your hands, a shovel, or even a tractor or backhoe. City crews dig up roads to repair water pipes, and gardeners dig small for planting bulbs. You can even say you dig your brother in the side when you jab him there. If someone says, ""I dig you,"" they mean, ""I understand,"" and if they say, ""I dig your outfit,"" they like it. Both slang usages come from 1930s African American English.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0889,"<ul><li>To dine is to eat a meal, particularly the last meal of the day. When you invite friends over for dinner, you can ask them if they'd like to dine with you.</li><li>You can dine at home, or dine at a fancy restaurant — in either case, you're eating dinner. If someone tells you they ""dine out on"" a funny story, they mean it's endlessly entertaining and buys them a lot of good will and amusement. The verb dine comes from the Old French disner, ""to dine"" or ""to have a meal,"" from desjunare, ""to break one's fast.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0890,"<ul><li>To donate means to give something — money, goods, or time — to some cause, such as a charity. The word has a more altruistic meaning than does simply ""giving""; it suggests that you don't expect anything in return for the contribution.</li><li>The verb donate has always meant ""to give,"" all the way back to the Latin verb donāre, ""to give as a gift."" Trace it back even further, to the ancient Indo-European roots, and you still have that same feeling to the word — ""a gift."" But it's more than a gift — it's a gift with the intention of helping. As an African proverb says, ""If everybody in town donates one thread, the poor man has a shirt.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0891,"<ul><li>Something is double if it has two parts or if there are two versions of it. If you order a double dip ice cream cone, there will be two scoops of ice cream for you to lick.</li><li>If you fall while you're roller skating and end up with a double arm fracture, it means you broke your arm in two places. A joke with a double meaning has two of them, and if you double your tips at the coffee shop by smiling more at customers, you're making twice as much money. In addition to the adjective and verb versions of double, there's the noun: your double is someone who looks exactly like you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0892,"<ul><li>Flavor is the way something tastes. If an ice cream shop offers 50 flavors, each one of them will taste different.</li><li>The flavor of your soup can be adjusted by adding salt — and when you add ingredients to change a food's taste, you can say you flavor it.  From the flavor of food comes the sense of flavor meaning ""atmosphere"" or ""feeling."" You could say, for example, that you're not crazy about a particular clothing shop because it has such a glitzy, expensive flavor. Flavor initially meant ""smell,"" from the Vulgar Latin flator, ""odor.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0893,"<ul><li>A foundation is the base for something. You often hear about the structural foundations of buildings, but a good idea can also be the foundation of a successful business.</li><li>In the simplest sense, foundations support something else. Friendship is the foundation of a good marriage, and many svelte figures rely on girdles (known to underwear specialists as a foundation garment). But foundations are also charitable organizations. And in cosmetics, foundation is gooey make-up that's supposed to match your skin tone.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0894,"<ul><li>A generation can refer to a group of people who live at the same time and are about the same age. But generation is also the act of creating something, such as income, ideas or kids.</li><li>In 1965, Pete Townsend, the guitarist of The Who, wrote a song called ""My Generation."" The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix and other popular musicians of the day were called “the Woodstock Generation,” because they performed at a famous music festival in Woodstock, New York.  Generation is used in another way when people credit those bands — along with Elvis, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones — with the generation of rock-and-roll culture.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0895,"<ul><li>To handle something is to control it, the way an elephant handler might handle an elephant, or the way you would use a handle to lift a suitcase. If you're panicking, a friend might suggest you ""get a handle on yourself.""</li><li>How to get a handle on the word handle? Start with the thumb. Much like the word “thimble” is derived from “thumb,” “handle” essentially refers to an object held ""in hand,"" or placed under your control. Handle can also have a more abstract meaning, such as understanding or grasping a concept. You should be able to handle geometry before you start trig, right? A handle is also slang for a nickname. ""What's your handle?"" is another way of saying ""What's your name?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0896,"<ul><li>The noun layer describes a thin piece that's stacked on other thin pieces, like a layer of noodles in a lasagna dish. You can also apply a layer of paint to make your wall color more vivid.</li><li>Layer can also be used figuratively to describe an abstract thickness or barrier. Celebrities are known to surround themselves with managers, agents, stylists, and friends — forming a layer between them and the prying public. Layer can also be a verb. You can layer your bed with blankets on a cold night, as a layer of ice forms on the sidewalks and streets outside.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0897,"<ul><li>Mud is very wet dirt. On rainy days, you might enjoy putting on your tall rubber boots and squishing around in the mud.</li><li>When you mix soil with water, you get mud — a soft, almost sticky material. Mud results from a damp environment or a recent rain. There's also the mud that masons or bricklayers use to stick stones together — it resembles mud, though it's actually mortar or plaster, and to use it when building is to mud. The word mud also showed up in 1920s as slang"" meaning ""bad coffee,"" and if your ""name is mud,"" you've got a bad reputation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0898,"<ul><li>Something smooth is free of roughness, stubble, or other imperfections that you can feel with your hands. If your wooden table is giving you splinters, use a sander to smooth it down and make it smooth. As you can see, smooth works as both a verb and an adjective.</li><li>Smooth has lots of interesting uses: Caught in a wind storm? Better smooth out your hair when you head inside. Got a friend who's good with the ladies? Try imitating his smooth moves. Need help to smooth out a dispute between two friends? Invite them out for coffee and offer to help them smooth out their differences. Some pianists prefer ivory keys to plastic because they're less smooth, and their fingers don't slip. The best dancers can move smoothly from one move to another.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U15_0899,"<ul><li>Soil is the dirt between our fingers as we garden or farm, from which all living things come and to which, as the poets never tire of reminding us, all life eventually returns. Such a big meaning for such a little word.</li><li>To soil something also means to make it dirty, or to degrade it in some way — strange given the natural purity of soil. Sometimes nations talk about their soil, meaning the geographical area over which they have governance. In England in the eighteenth and nineteenth century the euphemism ""night soil"" was used to describe the contents of the commodes people kept under their bed. But you probably didn't want to know that.</li></ul>"

You might think getting a nose ring would make you unique, until you see five other people on the street with the same piercing.</li><li>If someone calls you unique you know that you are very special. The reason is that the Latin prefix uni- means ""one."" (Technically speaking, it isn't possible to be ""very unique"" — you either are or you're not.) Think of the prefix in unicorn for a creature with one horn and unicycle for a cycle with one wheel.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0901,"<ul><li>An academy is a fancy school, often one devoted to one subject or discipline, such as music or science. You can also use academy to describe the world of higher learning.</li><li>If you show unusual gifts as a clarinetist, you should consider attending the music academy in the next town. That's where you'll learn the most about your art. It's a private school, the Goodman Academy of Music, named after Benny Goodman, who was the greatest jazz clarinetist ever. If you want to use academy in its other sense, try ""Those home experiments are cool, but without peer review, the academy will never accept them as science."" Darn academy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0902,"<ul><li>Ancient means very old. Sometimes there's a sense of ""older than old."" My grandmother, bless her soul, lived until she was positively ancient.</li><li>Ancient art is that made in places and times we refer to as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and Ancient Egypt, and ""an ancient"" is someone who lived either during those eras, or in a Biblical context, before the flood that brought us the story of Noah and the Ark.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0903,"<ul><li>A board is a plank or surface, sometimes having buttons or controls. You can cut vegetables on a cutting board, post a flyer on a bulletin board, or cause a power outage on a circuit board.</li><li>The word board frequently finds itself as half of a compound word where the action takes place: You stand on a surfboard, type at a keyboard, or lose on a checkerboard. You can also sit on a board, meaning a team, of directors, or board, meaning stay, at a hotel. If you want to leave your hotel, you may board, or climb onto, your hovercraft. Remember: Being stiff as a board is not the same as being bored stiff.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0904,"<ul><li>100 years is called a century. The computer, the television, and video games were all invented in the twentieth century. People are now wondering what the twenty-first century holds for us.</li><li>The noun century comes from the Latin word centuria, which was a group of 100, particularly a group of 100 Roman soldiers (one of 16 such groups in a Roman legion). The word today still can refer to 100 of something. In sports, a century is a score of 100 in a game of cricket. A race of 100 yards or 100 miles is also sometimes called a century. In slang, century can also mean a 100 dollar bill.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0905,"<ul><li>A clue is a piece of evidence that helps solve a problem, or it's a slight hint. When you’re in the dark about the surprise party your friends are planning, they'll say, “She doesn’t have a clue!”</li><li>When you first join the police force, you’re mostly just walking the beat. But when you’re promoted to detective, your job is to look for that big clue that will help you solve the case. The original Middle English word was clew, which meant “a ball of thread.” If you were trapped in a labyrinth, you could follow the clew to help find your way out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0906,"<ul><li>A concert is a performance by musicians or singers for an audience. If you're in the glee club, you know about singing in concerts, and maybe you've seen your favorite bands in concert, too.</li><li>A concert usually doesn't involve theatrical staging. You can have a concert version of an opera, but that means the singers stand there and sing without sets or props, and without much acting or moving around. Less commonly, concert is a verb (accent on the second syllable), meaning to agree with others on something. That meaning shows up in the phrase in concert — your objections will carry more weight if you act in concert with your neighbors.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0907,"<ul><li>A county is a specific region of a state or country. While the United States is made up of 50 states, it also has 3,144 counties.</li><li>In the US, a county is a separate administrative area of a state — in other words, there is a local government that manages each individual country. In some parts of the country, there are town governments in addition to county governments, both of which are subordinate to the state government. The states range from having three counties (Delaware) to 254 counties (Texas). The Latin root of county is comitatus, ""jurisdiction of a count.""</li></ul>"

Such collections are usually printed as books, but some are now designed for use on computers.</li><li>Dictionary originally came from the Latin word dictionarius, meaning ""a manual or book of words."" A dictionary is most commonly used to look up the definitions of particular words, but other information, such as etymology and usage guidelines, often appears as well. Electronic dictionaries can include even more information, like slang and popular texting acronyms, such as ""ttyn,"" which stands for ""talk to you never.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0909,"<ul><li>The verb exist means to live, to have reality. Dodos no longer exist because they were hunted to extinction.</li><li>It's not only ""live"" things that exist. The government exists, as does your fear of heights. Anything that can be acknowledged in the present, exists. Another meaning for the verb exist is to support oneself or survive. If someone doesn't have a job, they may have to exist on unemployment benefits until they find one.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0910,"<ul><li>A flat is an apartment. It's called a flat because all the rooms in it are usually on the same floor. The word flat is much more common in British than American English.</li><li>Geometrically, something flat is an even, level plane, like Kansas relative to the Rocky Mountains, or the cargo area of a flatbed truck. As an adjective, flat means ""less than lively."" A flat soda has no bubbles. If your speech falls flat, no one was excited. If you get mugged you might choose to lie flat on the ground. A flat note is just below the right pitch. And if your cooking is flat, it's boring.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U16_0912,"<ul><li>Hidden things can't be seen — they're concealed in some way. A hidden video camera inside a teddy bear might secretly be keeping an eye on a new babysitter.</li><li>People with hidden feelings don't let their sadness, anger, and joy show; and hidden clues in a treasure hunt can't be easily found. Hidden things can be obscured deliberately (like hidden eggs at an Easter egg hunt), or simply out of view or undetected by you. Hidden is the past participle of hide, from the Old English hydan, which means ""to hide or conceal,"" but also ""to bury a corpse.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0913,"<ul><li>When you say maybe, you're not completely sure about your answer. If you say you'll maybe study at the library tonight, it is possible that you'll go there.</li><li>Maybe is a shortened version of the Middle English phrase, ""it may be."" People use it when they're not sure about something — or they aren't ready to give their answer. Sometimes other things have to happen — or not happen — before you can be sure. For example, because it might rain tomorrow, you aren't sure there will be a baseball game. In the meantime, you answer, ""Maybe,"" if someone asks if you are going to the game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0914,"<ul><li>An officer is someone who works for a police force or has a high position in the military. Police officers in some towns and cities patrol on bikes, or occasionally even on horseback.</li><li>You might see police officers patrolling in your neighborhood, or guarding a bank, or inspecting bags in a train station. Military officers hold a high rank, and they issue commands to lower-ranking service members, and an officer is also the commander of a military ship. Another kind of officer is simply ""a person who holds an office,"" which can mean an elected position or a senior job at a company, like a ""chief executive officer,"" or CEO.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0915,"<ul><li>When you buy a car from its original owner, you know it's only been owned by one person. Original means ""the very first.""</li><li>Original comes from the Latin word originem, which means ""beginning or birth."" Whether you're using it as an adjective to describe something that is literally the very first, or as a noun meaning something that serves as a model for making copies, original means ""first."" Even when you describe an original idea, meaning ""something fresh or unusual,"" you're talking about the first idea of its kind.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0916,"<ul><li>A pound is a unit of measuring mass. Your giant cat, at 16 pounds, may easily outweigh your tiny dog — and whether he does or not, he's definitely the boss.</li><li>Pound is one of those words with a dizzying number of meanings. There's the unit North Americans use to measure weight, and there's also the unit of currency in the U.K. that's basically equivalent to U.S. dollars. Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, among other countries, also have pound currencies. As a verb, pound means ""to hit or make a heavy thud,"" the way you pound a stake in the ground or your heart pounds when you're nervous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0917,"<ul><li>A process is a procedure, something you do in order to achieve a certain result. Some people try to carefully follow all the steps in a process. Other people just wing it.</li><li>You hear this word being used a lot to describe work. ""I am in the process of drafting a memo, even if I kill myself with late nights in the process."" The related word procession describes people or vehicles moving forward in an orderly way — a wedding opens with the bridal procession.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0918,"<ul><li>Anyone can write something just for themselves. If you publish your writing, it's available to others. For a writer, to publish is about the best thing there is.</li><li>Like a lot of words, publish is used in a few ways. When a writer publishes six articles, six pieces of his or her writing have been accepted for publication in books or magazines. When a company publishes an article or book, it actually prints it up and sells it to the public. If you write a blog, you can also say that you publish your writing. Or, a teacher can publish a magazine of student writing just for her class.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0919,"<ul><li>If you are sitting in a crowd of people watching actors on a stage, you're probably in a theater. If the performance is projected on a large screen, you're in a movie theater.</li><li>The Greek word for theater (theatron) comes from the verb theasthai, meaning “behold.” You are likely to behold a play or a film inside a theater. If you've dedicated your life to theater, you are probably an actor, director or playwright. Remember when you yelled “fire!” in a crowded theater and got arrested? That wasn't funny.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U16_0920,"<ul><li>The word wealth has many shades of meaning, but most involve having a lot of something — often money or something else that's valuable. You might have a wealth of experience, or you might have great personal wealth.</li><li>First used in the mid-13th century, the noun wealth can mean having a lot of material goods or money. A person with this kind of wealth may have a chateau in Italy with a vineyard and a personal yacht. Wealth can also mean a big supply of something. The birth of a newborn baby will surely bring a wealth of happiness and joy to a family.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0921,"<ul><li>If you wad up a piece of paper and line up a shot at a wastebasket, you are taking aim. If instead, the paper bounces off your teacher's head, then your aim was way off.</li><li>A purpose or goal is an aim. When you were little, your aim might have been to be a famous astronaut, a movie star, or a police officer. As a verb, aim means to intend, try, or aspire. You may aim to take your dog for three walks every day, but your fenced-in yard tends to make both of you lazy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0922,"<ul><li>Use the verb attach when you need to join things together, like a stamp that you attach to a letter.</li><li>When you attach something, you join it or tie it to something else. The word can be used to show physically joining things, like a printer that you attach to your computer, or to show a strong personal connection. For example, you can attach yourself to a political cause or to a group of friends.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0923,"<ul><li>To bet is to gamble or risk something valuable against an unknown outcome. Poker players bet on each hand, hoping the cards they hold will beat those of the other players.</li><li>Sometimes you bet money on a sporting event, wagering on the team you think will win and collecting even more money if it does. It's even more common to bet in a figurative way, saying something like, ""I'd be willing to bet that the bus will be late again."" The money you risk when you bet is also called a bet. The word probably comes from the now-obsolete noun abet, or ""abetment.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0924,"<ul><li>A carriage is a vehicle with wheels that's usually pulled by horses. In some cities, you can go for a carriage ride through the park.</li><li>A carriage generally has four wheels and is pulled by two or more horses, while the smaller cart tends to have two wheels and be pulled by a single horse. In Britain, you might hear people refer to the separate compartments of a train as carriages as well, and in some parts of the US it's used to mean ""baby stroller"" or ""grocery cart."" The Latin root is carrum, ""two-wheeled war chariot.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0925,"<ul><li>The noun classic means something that's very high quality, particularly if it has lasting value. The pristine Model T Ford that you keep in your garage is a classic, but the beat up old Honda you drive everyday is not.</li><li>Use the adjective classic to describe something that relates to ancient Greece or Rome. You can enjoy the classic Greek pillars on the outside of your house but still appreciate the modern plumbing on the inside of it. Classic also means excellent, of recognized authority, or definitive. Classic literature, for example, includes authors like Mark Twain and Jane Austin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0926,"<ul><li>A commute is a journey you take from home to work and back again. You might enjoy your subway commute because it gives you lots of time to read.</li><li>Your commute is your trip to work, and the verb commute describes making that trip — like your preference to commute by public bus. Another meaning of commute describes changing the length of a judicial sentence, like when a judge commutes someone's time in jail. You can see this meaning in the word's origin — the Latin word commutare, meaning ""to change altogether.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0927,"<ul><li>When you need to make sure before you leave that you have a reservation, you often call ahead to confirm, that is, to make sure that your tickets or space are set aside for you.</li><li>The firm in confirm should give you a clue as to the word's meaning: to shore up or verify something. When you make sure something is set, or firm, you confirm it. The word comes from the Latin con- ""together, altogether,"" and firmāre ""make firm,"" so confirm originally meant roughly ""to make (something) altogether firm.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0928,"<ul><li>To criticize is to find what's wrong with something, like the improbabilities in a movie's plot line, or double standards in your father's rules.</li><li>The verb criticize comes from the noun, critic, and means ""to act like a critic."" A critic is someone who judges, and that doesn't have to mean negative judgment (think of a glowing movie review from a movie critic), but when we use criticize we always mean finding what's wrong, instead of what's good, with something. If your friend is just learning to bake, don't criticize his first batch of burned cookies too harshly; he'll just give up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0929,"<ul><li>To differ is to be different, or to vary. Your list of favorite movies might differ from your sister's, especially if you like romantic comedies and she likes action films.</li><li>Gas prices differ from state to state, and sometimes even from one side of the street to the other. Opinions on politics can often differ within a single family, and sometimes food preferences differ so much that no one can decide where to eat lunch. The verb differ can mean simply ""be unlike,"" but it can also mean ""clash"" or ""dissent."" The Latin root, differre, combines dis, ""away from,"" with ferre, ""carry.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0930,"<ul><li>An expense is a cost, but you can also use this word to mean the figurative cost of something. If you find it embarrassing to dress up as Santa, you might say that you do it to amuse your nephews, at the expense of your pride.</li><li>When you give one thing up in order to get something else, its cost or sacrifice is the expense of getting what you want. You might worry that politicians want to cut taxes at the expense of schools that need money, or that oil companies increase drilling at the expense of the environment. The root of expense the Latin expendere, ""to weigh out money or pay down.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0931,"<ul><li>Being formal is all about being taken seriously. If you're invited to the White House, you'll want to make a good impression, so it's a good idea to adopt a generally formal demeanor. No jeans or trash talking allowed.</li><li>In our casual world, there are still many times we need to be formal, like at weddings or funerals.  Adopting a formal manner — i.e., dressing up and not eating with your hands — will help you make a good impression on job interviewers or future in-laws. Being formal doesn't have to mean being stiff or unnatural; it's basically just using good manners and following the rules.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0932,"<ul><li>The noun height can mean the measurement of something from bottom to top. A pediatrician will measure the height of a child to make sure they are growing at a normal and healthy rate.</li><li>Height derives from the Old English word hehthu, meaning ""top of something."" To measure your height, you measure the distance from the floor to the top of your head. The height of a mountain is its elevation above sea level (the height of Mt. Everest, for instance, is 29,029 feet). Height can also mean the most extreme or intense part of something: The height of cherry blossom season in Japan is late March through early April.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0933,"<ul><li>To invent is to create for the first time or make up. If you tell your friends that you invented the electric guitar, you are inventing a pretty unbelievable story about your past.</li><li>When you think of the word invent, think of Thomas Alva Edison who invented the long-lasting light bulb, the motion picture camera, the phonograph, and the stock ticker. That's a lot of inventions! You couldn't invent a better story of American ingenuity, could you?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0934,"<ul><li>Use the word junior to describe things that are intended for young people, like the junior chess tournament for elementary school kids or the junior department in a clothing store, with kid-sized sweaters and jeans.</li><li>Junior is used to mean ""younger,"" so you might describe your cousin as being six years your junior. It also means ""lower in rank,"" so new representatives in Congress are often called ""junior members,"" and workers are described as junior to others higher in the company hierarchy. As a noun, a junior is in the third year of high school or college, and if you share your dad's name, he is Julio Smith and you are Julio Smith, Junior.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0935,"<ul><li>Although the word labor seems to suggest tough, physical work that makes you sweat, any type of work, whether physical or mental, can be considered labor.</li><li>Labor is usually associated with very hard, physical work, suggesting fatigue and aching muscles. In fact, a woman giving birth is said to be in labor, giving true meaning to the phrase ""labor of love."" The word can also be used as a verb, as in ""He had to labor many years to pay off his debt."" That sense of hard work fits in with the Labor Party of some nations, a party generally favored by and supporting the working class.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0936,"<ul><li>A mechanic is a person who builds or repairs engines or other machines. Mechanics are trained to use special tools and often work in shops or garages. If you are planning to be a mechanic, you have to be prepared to get your hands dirty.</li><li>The most common type of mechanic works on vehicles like cars, motorcycles, tractors, or airplanes. If your car is making a strange noise, you should probably take it to a mechanic. The oldest meaning of this word was simply ""laborer,"" or ""person who works with his hands,"" from the Greek root mekhanikos, ""engineer."" The current sense of mechanic came into use along with the popularity of the automobile.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0937,"<ul><li>If something is in its prime, it is at its best. The same goes for a person. If you are young and healthy and in the prime of your life, you are ready to take on the world.</li><li>Prime often means ""main."" The prime reason you go to concerts is to see your favorite groups perform. If your mother is angry that you came home late, tell her that this is a prime example of why you need a cell phone — so you can call her. It can also mean ""of the highest quality"" as in prime beef or flowers. As a verb, prime means to get ready. Hopefully you've primed yourself for your exams. Prime the pump and start the engine!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0938,"<ul><li>Shift the verb and shift the noun are very similar in meaning. A shift is a change in something or an adjustment in the way something is done. You can either make a shift (that's the noun), or you can just shift (that's the verb).</li><li>What makes a shift different from, say, a change is that it implies some kind of movement; a sense that the thing that you're shifting is still the same thing, just moving in a different direction. For example, when you shift gears in a car you're simply moving from one gear to another. If you shift your focus, you're still focused, but the focus has moved. If the government shifts its policy, that policy, while different, is still a policy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0939,"<ul><li>A signal is a gesture or message that people use to communicate with each other. The wave you give a good friend to call her over from across the room and the impulse that transmits your voice through the telephone to your mother are both signals.</li><li>In the course of a single day, you probably send and receive thousands of different signals. When you want to cross the street, you wait for the green light — a signal that it's safe to cross. If you're in a relationship and you're not sure whether you like the person you're dating, you could be sending mixed signals — first acting like you're interested, and then acting uninterested. If your date finally gets tired of your mixed signals while you're at a restaurant, you'll need to signal to your server that it's time for the check.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U17_0940,"<ul><li>Being sincere is being genuine. If someone compliments you on your outfit, but you notice them rolling their eyes when they think you’re not looking, they probably weren't being sincere.</li><li>If you've been offered a sincere thanks for something you've done, the person is probably really grateful. Sometimes when people say ""thank you,"" they don't always mean it, but when they add the adjective sincere, the emphasis is usually for a very good reason. You may hear a charity sending out a sincere thanks to sponsors for their donations, which help keep the charity running.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0941,"<ul><li>Ability is skill or talent. You might have the ability to blow bubbles, or sing in a falsetto, or dance the waltz. Or, just maybe, you have the ability to do all three things at once. Impressive!</li><li>From the Old French ablate ""expert at handling (something),"" and that from the Latin habilitatem, ""aptitude,"" comes the English ability, a noun indicating the power to act, perform, or accomplish. Capacity is similar in meaning to ability, but note that people have a capacity for doing something, and an ability to do something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0942,"<ul><li>Agriculture describes the practice of growing crops or raising animals. Someone who works as a farmer is in the agriculture industry.</li><li>The Latin root of agriculture is agri, or ""field,"" plus cultura, ""cultivation."" Cultivating a piece of land, or planting and growing food plants on it, is largely what agriculture means. Raising animals for meat or milk also falls under the category of agriculture. If we didn't have agriculture, we'd all be running around the woods, picking berries and trying to shoot things.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0943,"<ul><li>A cartoon makes a brief, funny comment using illustrations and is often found on television, in a newspaper or in a magazine. The Simpsons and Snoopy? Both cartoons.</li><li>A cartoon can be a satirical or humorous drawing, a series of illustrations (also called a comic strip), or an animated film. Many kids grow up watching new and classic cartoons on TV. Political cartoons manage to sum up an often complex idea in one simple panel. When you criticize a character or a real person for being a cartoon, you mean that they are overly simplified or exaggerated: ""I hate that show because all the women are cartoon characters."" The word comes from the Italian cartone, ""strong, heavy paper.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0944,"<ul><li>A ceiling is the upper surface of a room. If you’re lying on the floor, you’re staring up at the ceiling. If you’re lying on the ceiling, you’ll be lying on the floor again soon.</li><li>You may have heard the sky’s the limit — but in truth, the limit is the ceiling, both physically and metaphorically. The top of a room, but still under the roof, a ceiling is the point at which you can go no farther. You’ll find both helium balloons and hot tempers hitting it. In the workplace, if you aren't getting that promotion and can't understand why, you might have hit a ""glass ceiling.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0945,"<ul><li>""How again was it that you convinced me to do this?"" the boy said to his friend before they jumped out of the plane on their first sky dive. Convince means to talk someone into something, or win someone over.</li><li>A person convinces by making an argument—you can convince your parents to let you go to the movies by promising you'll do all your homework the next day. A thing can convince as well. The cash prize convinced me to enter the contest. The threat of failure convinced the kids to study.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0946,"<ul><li>If you’re curious, you really want to know something — like the secret ingredient that makes these cookies so crunchy. You may wish you hadn’t been so curious when you find out it’s roasted crickets.</li><li>Curious describes someone who is eager to find out answers and to explore and learn.  A curious student asks lots of questions. A curious little monkey, like the famous Curious George from the children’s book series, may be so curious to know how a clock works that he breaks it trying to get a closer look inside. Curious can also describe something unusual, like a house that is painted a curious shade of purple.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0947,"<ul><li>A delay is a wait or a postponement. An unexpected delay before the start of a play might make the audience restless and noisy.</li><li>During a delay, you have to wait around for things to begin. Delay is also a verb: ""That burnt pizza is going to delay dinner for at least another hour."" You can also delay by loitering or hanging around: ""The performer always delays when he's nervous about singing in front of a crowd."" Delay comes from the Old French delaiier, from the roots de-, ""not,"" and laier, ""leave.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0948,"<ul><li>Dear diary, you are a written record of things that happen each day. Some people keep a diary while they’re traveling, others keep their secrets in a diary. Either way, keep out!</li><li>Some diaries have a pretty cover and a tiny lock with a key, for keeping the contents safe from prying eyes. You can also call such a book a ""journal,"" although traditionally a diary is written in each day, while a journal might have less frequent entries. The word diary comes from the Latin word diarium, ""daily allowance,"" with its root of dies, or ""day.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0949,"<ul><li>An element is something basic and important — in chemistry, an element is one of the essential molecules that everything else is made of. If a book's ending carries an ""element of surprise,"" it means surprise is an important part of the story's end.</li><li>One of the earliest meanings of this noun was in reference to any of four substances — earth, air, fire, or water — that were formerly regarded as a basic constituent of the universe. When you're ""in your element,"" it means you're enjoying yourself because what you're doing is basic and important to you. Stand-up comics are in their element when they're performing to a crowd who loves them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0950,"<ul><li>When you have faith, you trust or believe in something very strongly. Some people have faith in a higher being, others put their faith behind the Red Sox.</li><li>This noun comes from the Old French word feid, meaning “faith, belief, trust, confidence, pledge.” It's often used when describing religion or the supernatural: people have faith in God, or actually refer to the religion they practice as their faith. Some choose to have the same amount of faith in a good friend or a well written recipe — anything that will come through for them in a time of need.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0951,"<ul><li>When carpenters sand a piece of wood, they ""go with the grain."" Grain is the texture on piece of wood, which often forms long patterns that show the direction in which the tree grew.</li><li>You may have heard someone say ""there's a grain of truth to that"" when referring to an outrageous story that has a tiny bit of truth to it. A grain can also be a speck or a particle — the tiniest bit of something. Don't confuse this with another definition of grain, the kind you find in your bread — wheat, oats, alfalfa, and so on. Check out all the grains in the ten-grain bread next time you're in the bakery!</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U18_0953,"<ul><li>To investigate is to look into something systematically. If you don't understand how tornadoes work, for example, investigate the forces of wind and find out.</li><li>Investigate still acts a lot like the word it comes from, investigationem meaning ""a searching into,"" which came from the Latin for ""to track a footprint."" It's exactly what you do when you investigate. You can investigate in the name of science, which is to look into something systematically, like when you research how tornadoes work. If you investigate a person, you find out everything you can — and you might need to hire a private eye for help.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0954,"<ul><li>Joy is the emotion of pleasure and happiness. Joy can also be the very thing that delights you.  You might find great joy in learning new vocabulary. Or not.</li><li>Joy can also be used as a verb.  You can joy in the fact that you have no homework for the weekend.  Or, you might want to rejoice when the teacher announces that the test has been canceled.  It's a real joy to use the word as an adjective, too.  For example, receiving straight A's probably makes you extremely joyful.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0955,"<ul><li>The saying “labels are for jars not people” means it’s OK to put a description on a jar so you know what’s inside (a label), but it’s not okay to judge people by attaching a label, or description to them, such as ""nerd,"" ""jock,"" or ""burnout.""</li><li>Label is a busy word. It refers to the paper or identifying marks on a jar that tells you something about what’s inside the jar. Put such an identifier on the jar, and you label it. Related to that is a judgment about someone or something, a label. When you call yourself a superstar, you label yourself. Finally, you can use label as a short form of recording label, a company that produces musical recordings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0956,"<ul><li>A monk is a man who has dedicated his life to religion, partly by giving up some aspects of regular, worldly life. Many monks live together in a religious community.</li><li>To a greater or lesser extent, a monk has chosen to leave society and devote his life to prayer and service. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, some monks pray unceasingly, while Buddhist monks often teach others, and Roman Catholic monks sing in choirs. In some cases, monks raise money for their churches by training dogs, baking bread, or even brewing beer. Originally, monk referred to men or women, though it's more common today to use nun for a woman.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0957,"<ul><li>The numbers 1, 3, 5, and 35 are all odd numbers — they can't be divided by two. They are not even. Also, things that are weird or strange are called odd.</li><li>This word covers things that are slightly off-kilter, like odd numbers. You can use odd for a single thing that belongs in a pair, like an odd sock or odd mitten. If someone wants you to do odd jobs, that could mean almost anything: odd jobs are random and unpredictable jobs that could come up. When you describe a person as odd, or that they’re exhibiting odd behavior, it means they're peculiar and out of the ordinary.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0958,"<ul><li>The noun pause means ""a short break,"" like the pauses in television shows that allow for commercials to be shown.</li><li>Pause can also be a verb that means ""to stop for a short time."" Teachers, for example, often pause after making an important point to check that students understand and to give them time to ask questions. Pause which rhymes with laws and cause, comes from the Greek word pausis, ""stopping, ceasing,"" which comes from pauein ""to stop, to cause to cease."" Why don't you pause and think about that for a moment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0959,"<ul><li>A priest is a religious figure who performs ceremonies, particularly in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, or Orthodox church. During a Catholic baptism, a priest sprinkles holy water on a baby's head.</li><li>Though priests are often thought of as Christian, there are other religions with priests, including some branches of Shintoism and Hinduism. Priests often lead religious services, perform weddings and other religious rites, and in many cases work full time for their churches. Priest comes from the Old English prēost,  and it shares a root with Presbyterian, the Greek presbyteros, ""an elder.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U18_0960,"<ul><li>An open declaration of an opinion or belief is a profession. If you announce that you believe the earth is flat, your profession of this opinion might cause some giggling among your well-educated friends.</li><li>Careers that require specialized training or advanced degrees are considered professions. Your parents may want you to go into a profession like the practice of law, but you dream of being a rodeo clown. The collective group of people practicing a profession is also called profession. The medical profession doesn't know what to make of that thing growing out of your foot. You are a medical mystery!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0961,"<ul><li>Always round, often bouncy, a ball is a vital part of many games and sports, from soccer to four square to ping pong.</li><li>The most common ball is the kind you hit, kick, bat, or duck and avoid on a playground, court, or field. In fact, most sports involve a ball in one way or another. Another fun kind of ball is a grand party that usually includes dancing, food, live music, and guests dressed up in glamorous clothing. These two meanings have different origins — the ""fancy dance"" kind of ball comes from a Greek root, ballizein, ""to dance or jump about.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0962,"<ul><li>The bottom of something is its underside, or lowest point. You might practice swimming by diving to the bottom of a swimming pool to retrieve pennies.</li><li>When you're hungry, you'll eat to the bottom of your ice cream bowl, and if you're looking for your car keys, you may need to dig to the very bottom of your tote bag. A thing's underside is also its bottom, so you might check out the bottom of your foot if you think you have a splinter. Informally, your bottom is also your buttocks, or your backside. It comes from the Old English botm, ""ground"" or ""foundation.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0963,"<ul><li>Company most often implies a group, whether it be a group of people, a unit of firefighters, a small group of soldiers, or a group working for the same business.</li><li>Company can also refer to a visitor, often for dinner. This usage is both singular and plural, so if your mom says ""there's company coming for dinner,"" you will need to know how many places to set at the table. There are more than a few idioms using the word company. When you are with someone, you “keep company” with them. For the more dour, there is “misery loves company.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0964,"<ul><li>To drink is to sip, slurp, or gulp a liquid. On extremely hot days, it's important to drink plenty of water.</li><li>When you ingest any liquid, you drink it, although the verb drink is very often used to refer specifically to the sipping and swallowing of alcoholic beverages. If a bartender asks, ""Do you drink?"" she probably means ""Do you drink alcohol?"" A drink, likewise, can mean any beverage — tea, water, or lemonade — or it can mean an alcoholic one. The Old English root, drincan means both ""to drink"" and ""to engulf.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0965,"<ul><li>Few is a word for a small, non-specific number. A few is somewhere between a couple and a whole bunch.</li><li>When you say you're going to have a few fries, you'd better not eat the whole order — a few is a tiny number. It takes more than a few people to play basketball, though they could probably play two-on-two. This is one of many words for amounts that aren't specific, like a bunch, a load, or a bit. If someone refers to the few, they're talking about an elite, special group, like ""The few. The proud. The Marines.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0966,"<ul><li>Line has many meanings, most stemming from the basic idea of something unbroken and often straight. It might be the line you wait in at the market, or just a connection of two points.</li><li>The original meaning of line came from the Latin word linea, or “linen thread.”  Your career is also your ""line of work.""  Since you're an engineer, you might say ""that's not in my line"" if you are asked to bake a cake.  A ""pick-up line"" is something you might hear from a person at a party who's flirting with you.  It will probably be corny.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0967,
4000EEW_B02_U19_0968,"<ul><li>When you start making something, the result is a product. Most products are offered for sale, like dairy products at the grocery store or kitchen products at Macy's.</li><li>The word product is often a synonym for ""merchandise"" — the stuff for sale on the racks and shelves at a store. But a product can also simply be the result or consequence of someone's efforts or a set of circumstances. A good report card is the product of hard work. You are the product of your parent's relationship. And an aging hippie who still wears bell bottoms may be described as a product of the sixties.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0969,"<ul><li>If you're the responsible one, everyone is depending on you to take care of it. And, if things go poorly, it's all your fault.</li><li>Sounds like a drag to be responsible but really it is what we all want out of life. After all, when you're responsible, you get the keys to the car, you make your own decisions, and you get all the credit. Parents love the responsible babysitter who doesn't text with her friends and feed the kids bowls of ice cream. Of course, the boy who is responsible for bringing firecrackers to the football game will not be looked upon with the same level of respect. Responsibility can bring all the glory, but all the blame too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0970,"<ul><li>To sell is to exchange a thing or a service for money. You could sell lemonade from a table on the sidewalk, or sell hotdogs at a baseball game.</li><li>When a business or store carries certain products for purchase, they sell those things; a car lot sells automobiles, and a bookstore sells books and magazines. Sometimes people say that an item ""sells at"" or ""sells for"" a certain price: ""Normally, those candy bars sell for a dollar each."" When something sells out, it's totally gone, but when a person sells out, they give up their principles for money or popularity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0971,"<ul><li>A snake is a long reptile without legs that moves by undulating, arching the bones in its back and pushing against the ground. A pet snake is easy to care for, unless you're squeamish about feeding it mice.</li><li>Like other reptiles, snakes are covered in smooth scales. Unlike most, snakes have flexible jaws that allow them to eat things much wider than their own narrow bodies — if you see a big lump in the middle of a garter snake's body, you can be pretty sure it's just eaten a mouse. Because so many people are afraid of snakes (the vast majority of which are not poisonous), the word has also come to mean ""treacherous or deceitful person."" Snake is a verb as well, meaning ""move like a snake.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0972,"<ul><li>To stand is to be upright or vertical, with your feet on the floor, or to move into that position. Most people stand when they hear the national anthem at a baseball game.</li><li>If you place something in an upright position in a certain spot, you stand it, and objects stand when they're situated in a certain location: ""Those beautiful buildings stand at the top of the hill."" A support where an object will be placed is also called a stand. When you stand for something, you believe strongly in it, and you can also describe that belief as your stand: ""My stand on the school dress code isn't too popular among other students.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0973,"<ul><li>Anything that is unusual or out of the ordinary can be described as strange, like the strange sight of an ice cream truck pulling up in front of your school and your principal skipping over to it.</li><li>The adjective strange comes from Latin word extraneus, meaning “foreign” or “external.” If someone approaches you speaking with a strange accent, it means you can't identify where the person is from, not that he or she is odd or weird — the newer meaning of strange. But remember, it once was a strange sight to see a person talking on a cell phone; when the unknown becomes known, it is no longer strange.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0974,"<ul><li>The drink that's made by soaking dried leaves in very hot water is called tea. On a hot summer day, many people like to drink iced tea.</li><li>Use the word tea for the drink you sip in a cup and also for the dried leaves used to make it. Aside from water, tea is the most common beverage in the world, and it's been around since at least the 28th century BCE, when historians believe it was invented in China. In Britain, tea is also a meal, typically eaten in the middle of the afternoon. Before the 18th century, the word tea was pronounced ""tay.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0975,"<ul><li>If your boss tells you not to test her patience, she means don't push her today, because she might just snap.</li><li>Surely you're familiar with vocabulary tests? In this case, someone is giving you difficult questions to see how much you know. Test more generally means ""trial."" If you test a soap on your skin, you use it on one small patch, to see if you'll have an allergic reaction. A drug test looks for the presence of drugs in your system. A difficult time in life is sometimes called ""a test,"" because it's testing your strength to persevere.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0976,"<ul><li>Your tongue is the muscle in your mouth that you press against your teeth in order to speak, as well the home of your taste buds. What a useful member of the body!</li><li>Tongue supposedly came from the Latin word lingua, meaning ""language,"" but you can't hear the similarity because we pronounce it TUNG, keeping the ""ue"" silent. A tongue can be anything shaped like your tongue. The flap of leather under your shoelaces is called a tongue, and so is the striker inside a bell. Tongue also means language, like the German tongue, or the Cajun tongue. As a verb, tongue means ""lick,"" as in when the dog tongues your empty plate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0977,
4000EEW_B02_U19_0978,"<ul><li>A type is a specific category of things or people that have something in common. Your favorite type of candy might be dark chocolate, while your brother's favorite type is jelly beans.</li><li>There are two basic sorts of types: first, a group of similar things — and in biology, specifically, ""an organism with the essential characteristics of its group."" The second type of type consists of letters, numbers, or symbols that are printed or shown on a computer screen, like the extra-large type in your grandpa's library book. As a verb, to type means to use a typewriter or keyboard to write.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0979,"<ul><li>The word very is an intensifier, suggesting a high degree of a quality. Something great is very good.</li><li>This word adds intensity to statements and means something close to really or extremely. If you are tired, you might have some coffee. If you are very tired, you might need a nap. An 80 degree day is hot, but a 90 degree day is very hot. This word also means exact, as in ""On this very day, I was born"" or ""That's the very book you were talking about.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U19_0980,"<ul><li>A wait is the time it takes for something to happen. The wait to get the brand new computer was four hours long, but it was worth it.</li><li>The word wait originated in the 1200s, from the Old Northern French word waitier: ""to watch with hostile intent."" Even back then, people didn't like to wait. Anticipating something that will happen is waiting, though sometimes what you wait for never comes — like Godot, who never shows up in the play ""Waiting for Godot."" When you wait to do something, you delay. When you wait tables, you serve people, preferably without delay.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0981,"<ul><li>To accomplish something is to get it done. People usually accomplish things that are sources of pride — like goals or records. But people accomplish immoral acts as well — like scandals or cons.</li><li>The verb accomplish also means to bring about or put into effect. The CEO stood before the employees and outlined all she expected to be accomplished in the next year. She ended her speech by saying, ""If we are to accomplish this, we must all work together — and work hard — but the rewards if we succeed will be great both for the company and for those that work here. Thank you for your efforts!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0982,"<ul><li>When you take your new love to meet your parents, you hope that they approve of your choice in partners, but when your date starts eating with his hands at dinner, chances are pretty slim.</li><li>Approve was first used like to mean ""prove"" or ""show""––think, ""The proof is in the pudding."" Now, approve means to officially agree. You might need the principal to sign off on, or approve, any purchase of new materials for the classroom. Congress can also approve a bill or budget in this way. It’s important to remember that, like apple and appropriate, approve is spelled with a double “p.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0983,"<ul><li>To approximate is to calculate the value of something based on informed knowledge. A computer program can approximate the value of a house based on square footage, number of rooms, year built, and other relevant factors.</li><li>As a verb, approximate means ""to estimate."" Unlike the word guess, approximate implies the use of a logical or mathematical method. You might guess how tall a friend is based on the first number that comes to mind, but you could approximate his height by using your own height as a comparison. As an adjective, approximate can mean ""near"" or ""close together."" If your friend calls to say he’s at a location approximate to your house, she’s in your neighborhood.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0984,"<ul><li>Barriers are walls, either physical or metaphorical. They can block movement — the Great Wall of China was a barrier to block invading forces from entering. A window shade is a light barrier. Failing English is a barrier to getting into Harvard.</li><li>When people are being excluded from joining a clique, you could say that the clique has erected a social barrier. When fighter jets fly faster than the speed of sound, they break through what feels like a wall in the sky called the sound barrier. The Green Monster at Fenway Park keeps Boston Red Sox fans from being able to watch games from outside the stadium — it's a barrier to sight. But when line drives hit the Green Monster, bouncing the ball back into left field, the Green Monster acts also a barrier to easy home runs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0985,"<ul><li>The verb detect means to discover or observe the existence of something. If you walk into your house and detect the odor of burnt food, you can deduce from the evidence that you will be going out to dinner tonight!</li><li>The verb detect comes from the Latin word detegere, which literally means ""to uncover"" — or more figuratively, to discover. You may detect the presence of a new dog in your house if you note a water bowl, chew toys, and grooming tools. Of course, the large woofing beast that greeted you at the door with a wagging tail might be a big clue as well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0986,"<ul><li>When you've done your duty, you've done what you're supposed to and met your responsibilities.  Your sense of duty as a citizen might compel you to vote; it might also keep you from voting twice.</li><li>A duty is an obligation, and we get new duties with new positions in life, like taking a job, or becoming a parent. You didn't realize one of your duties as club president would be cleaning up after meetings. A police officer or cab driver can be on-duty or off-duty.  As an off-duty police officer, you might still feel it's your duty to stop a robbery. Duty also means ""tax,"" which is why people like shopping duty-free at the airport.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0987,"<ul><li>Things that are elementary are simple or not very advanced, as in elementary school or Sherlock Holmes' famous line, ""Elementary, my dear Watson!""</li><li>Remember elementary school? That's an earlier, less advanced type of school than middle and high school. Things that are elementary are simpler — easy enough for a first grader to handle. A puzzle that's a snap to solve could be called elementary. We can also say that something is elementary when it's a basic building block of something else: a good breakfast is elementary to healthy nutrition, for example.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0988,"<ul><li>If you experience failure, things have not gone the way you'd hoped.  I'm sorry to hear that your attempt to turn hay into gold has been a failure.</li><li>Failure can also mean when something suddenly stops working or when you don't do something that you're expected to.  A power failure might create an opportunity for a romantic candlelight dinner.  Your failure to pay the electric bill may lead to a lot of romantic candlelight dinners, as long as you at least paid the gas bill. Someone who has no success in life a failure, as is an effort that doesn't work like your failure of a presidential campaign.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0989,"<ul><li>Use the adjective gradual to describe something that happens slowly, bit by bit, like the gradual increase in the amount of daylight in winter.</li><li>Gradual can also apply to the gentle slope of landforms like hills. A gradual incline seems to slowly rise — you may not even realize you're walking up such a hill. Gradual comes from the Latin word gradus, which means ""step."" Step by step, a gradual hill climbs, while a steep hill seems to leap up into the air.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0990,"<ul><li>The United States is a country of immigrants — people who come to one country from another country, in hopes of having a better life. An inscription on the base of the Statue of Liberty welcomes new immigrants: ""Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...""</li><li>Don't confuse the words immigrant and emigrant. If you come to a country, you are an immigrant and you emigrate from somewhere else. Ireland has many emigrants to America; America has many immigrants from Ireland. If your parents were immigrants to the United States, but you were born here, you are a citizen automatically.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0991,"<ul><li>When you insert something or someone, you put it into something else. You could insert yourself into a conversation, or you could insert a comma into the sentence you just wrote.</li><li>The verb insert comes from the Latin in-, meaning “into,” and serere, meaning ""to join."" When you insert yourself into a conversation, you’re joining in, whether your friends want you to or not. Insert can also mean to fit snugly into, or to tuck. You might fit a card into an envelope that fits it perfectly, or insert first one leg and then another into a pair of tights.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0992,"<ul><li>An instant is a very short time. In combinations like instant coffee and instant replay it means available right away without a wait.</li><li>Instant and moment mean the same thing if you are talking about a particular time in the past like you remember the instant or moment you realized that you had won the lottery. However, the two words are very different when talking about time in the future. ""I'll be there in an instant"" means you're coming as quickly as possible, whereas if you say ""I'll be there in a moment,"" someone is going to have to wait a bit for you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0993,"<ul><li>Families who live in poverty have a hard time getting enough food to eat. ""The loss of jobs in the area led to increased poverty."" ""The poverty rate is the percent of people who live in poverty in a geographic area.""</li><li>In the US, the government pays careful attention to how many citizens are living above and below the poverty level, which is defined by a certain maximum level of income. Poverty can also mean the lack of an important quality besides having enough money to live comfortably. For the last five years, David's sister has given him a pair of socks for his birthday. David believes this reflects the poverty of her imagination.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0994,"<ul><li>To pretend is to act as if you're someone else. If you pretend to be your mother for a phone conference with your math teacher, try putting on her high heels to help you get into character.</li><li>When children or actors are pretending, it's fine, just playing. But if you pretend to someone who doesn't know you're just playing, you're likely to be condemned for it. No one likes it of you pretend to be a good member of the community just so people won't suspect you when you steal things from their houses. You might pretend you went to Harvard to impress someone, but if he finds out you didn't, he'll be very unimpressed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0995,"<ul><li>The word rank often deals with one's position or status in a group.  In the military, an officer with a high rank will be in charge of soldiers of lower rank.</li><li>The noun rank refers to a position within a hierarchy, and to rank something is to put it in order — for example, your high school might rank students in terms of their GPAs. You can also use rank to describe an especially foul smell, like the rank gym shoes in the back of your closet. Linguists see the Old English ranc as having roots prior to the 11th century, possibly from the Old Norse rakkr, meaning ""straight.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0996,"<ul><li>Recognition is when you remember something or someone you're familiar with — like the flash of recognition you experience at your high school reunion.</li><li>Recognition isn't just about remembering what something looks like — it's also used to describe when you remember that someone has done something special, and decide to recognize their efforts with an award or speech. This type of recognition is a form of acknowledgment, a way to say ""we approve"" or ""good work!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0997,"<ul><li>To refrigerate something is to preserve it by keeping it cool. A gallon of milk might last a week if you refrigerate it, but it will be spoiled after a day or so if you leave it on the kitchen counter.</li><li>At home, you refrigerate things all the time by keeping them in your refrigerator. If there's no refrigerator available, people can refrigerate things by storing them in coolers or outside in the cold months of the year. A recipe for cookies might instruct you to refrigerate them for an hour before baking them — all you have to do is put the baking sheet in the fridge. Refrigerate shares a Latin root with frigid.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0998,"<ul><li>To rent something is to pay money to use it, live in it, or borrow it. If you're not sure which musical instrument you'll stick with and enjoy playing, it's best to rent a few to try out before buying.</li><li>Rent is both a verb and a noun for borrowing or leasing something. If you rent an apartment, you pay money to live there, and that money is also rent. You can rent many things, from skates at a roller rink to furniture for the home you rent. You don't own things you rent — you just use them temporarily. A rent is also a rip: ""She fell and tore a big rent in one knee of her jeans.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_0999,"<ul><li>If you stop working by choice and leave your position or occupation, you retire. If you are lucky, you can retire early in order to sail around the world, but most people can't retire until they are old enough to collect retirement benefits.</li><li>If you go to bed in the evening, you retire. If your younger siblings are being loud and obnoxious, you can retire to the basement to get some privacy and quiet. If something is withdrawn from circulation, it can also be retired. When a beloved player leaves a sports team, often the number assigned to him or her is retired and no one else can use that number.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U20_1000,"<ul><li>A statistic is a numerical piece of information. If you are trying to prove a point, and you want your argument to have a sense of authority, you might want to use a statistic to back up your claim.</li><li>A statistic is a single piece of information represented by a number. “Water makes up 70% of the Earth’s surface,” for instance, is a statistic. A statistic is like a fact that is reached through a mathematical process. A population figure is the most common statistic you will encounter. When made plural, statistics means either a collection of statistics or the science of creating and interpreting statistics, as in “His favorite course in college was Statistics.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1001,"<ul><li>An accident is an unfortunate event. By their very nature, accidents are not planned. Rear-ending the car ahead of you, spilling milk, losing your footing on an icy sidewalk — all of these are considered accidents.</li><li>You will most often hear people use accident to describe an unfortunate mistake, like swerving into oncoming traffic or making a sloppy calculation. However, an accident could have a positive outcome as well: ""The invention of the chocolate chip cookie was a happy accident, occurring when the cook decided to add the chopped chocolate to the batter without melting it first.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1002,"<ul><li>An astronaut is someone who travels in space. While the term was once reserved for military-trained professionals, recent accessibility of space travel has seen the term astronaut now used to refer to anyone traveling in a spacecraft, including civilians.</li><li>The word astronaut includes the root naut, from nautes, the Greek word for ""sailor."" This suffix can be used to create many travel-specific words. For example, the Argonauts were mythical Greek sailors on the ship named the Argo. Astronaut gets the astro from the Greek word astron, meaning ""star,"" making an astronaut a “star sailor.” Russian space explorers took the title cosmonauts, with the cosmo part coming from the Greek for ""universe,"" kosmos, so both have the same meaning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1003,"<ul><li>When you're awake, you're conscious and aware of your surroundings. When you're not awake, you're asleep. If you are reading this, you are indeed awake.</li><li>Most people are awake during the day and asleep at night, but if you work the night shift or suffer from insomnia, you might also be awake at night. When awake is used as a verb, it means ""wake up:"" ""I watched my kitten awake from a deep sleep and yawn."" Awake comes from two Old English roots, āwæcnan, ""to arise,"" and āwacian, ""to revive.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1004,"<ul><li>Someone with courage is bold and brave, unafraid to face tough challenges. Unlike the Cowardly Lion, who went all the way to the Emerald City to see if the Wizard had any courage to spare.</li><li>In Middle English, courage referred to “what is in one’s mind or thoughts."" Today, anyone with courage has only fearless feats and courageous acts in mind. Having courage means acting when others are afraid of the danger, or simply acting without fear of failure. As the American poet Robert Frost advised, “Have courage and a little willingness to venture and be defeated.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1005,"<ul><li>Float is what you do when you're lying on the water. Hopefully you know how to swim, so you can float suspended on the surface of the water, rather than sinking straight to the bottom.</li><li>We typically think of the verb float as something you do on the surface of an ocean or pool, but it's possible to float in mid-air too. You just need to be attached to a parachute so you don't come crashing down to the ground. You can also ""float on air"" in a more figurative sense. For example, if the person you're in love with suddenly gives you flowers, you could float around for hours feeling like your feet aren't touching the ground.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1006,"<ul><li>You can grant anything from a permanent restraining order to a request for time off, or, if you’re a genie, seven wishes. When you grant something you are letting someone have or do something that they are asking for.</li><li>When you grant something, you’re typically fulfilling a request that is not an automatic entitlement.  For example, if you order a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce in a restaurant, when the meal arrives, you wouldn’t say that the chef has been kind enough to grant you the meal; it’s an order that’s been fulfilled. If you ask the chef to make it a vegan dish that doesn’t include chicken stock, however, then you’re making a request that it’s up to the chef to grant — or not.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1007,"<ul><li>In physics, gravity is the natural force that causes things to fall toward the earth. The noun gravity can also mean seriousness or solemnity.</li><li>Someone who conducts themselves with an air of gravity is someone who takes what they are doing seriously. You might be amused to see a three year old serving her dolls tea with an air of gravity appropriate to the Queen of England. Gravity was borrowed through French from Latin gravitās, from gravis ""heavy.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1008,"<ul><li>A jewel is a valuable gem or stone, one that might be set in a ring or necklace. Your grandmother might keep her jewels locked in a safe, to protect them from thieves.</li><li>You can see large, gorgeous jewels in museums and jewelry stores. The diamond in a diamond ring is a jewel, and the rubies in a pair of sparkly red earrings are also jewels. You can also use the word to mean ""person as special as a jewel."" The Old French root is jouel, which may stem from jocus, ""sport or pastime"" in Latin, and ""that which causes joy"" in Vulgar Latin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1009,"<ul><li>Picture a hardhat, a headlamp and a pick, and you are on the right track. A miner is a person who makes a living digging coal, salt, gold, minerals, or other natural resources out of the earth.</li><li>The root here is the noun mine—not the word that possessive toddlers like to shout, but the one that describes a man-made underground network of tunnels and quarries. Don’t confuse miner with minor (note the “o”). Minor refers to musical intervals, small or trivial things, and people under age 18.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1010,"<ul><li>A mineral is a nonliving natural substance of a definite chemical composition. A mineral like manganese may help keep you healthy; a mineral like a diamond may help keep you sparkly.</li><li>At one time mineral referred to valuable substances obtained in mines. Although that still can be the case, today the word has several senses (both noun and adjective) and may be found almost anywhere — in the ground, in the air, or on the periodic table. And if you remember mineral when you remember animal and vegetable, you’ve got a better chance of winning Twenty Questions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1011,"<ul><li>If you take part in an activity or organization, you participate in it. For example, you participate in a conversation by listening to and talking with others, or you participate in a sport by joining a team and taking part in practices and games.</li><li>You can use the verb participate to mean ""be involved in"" or ""share in."" Sometimes it is easy to figure out who participates in something — the runners in a race, the people waiting their turn to audition for a part in a play. Sometimes it isn't so obvious. If two students cause trouble but the teacher punishes the whole class, it might be that in not stopping the troublemakers, she views everyone as having participated — just being there means they were involved.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1012,"<ul><li>If you give someone approval to do something, you are giving them permission. Think of the permission slip your parents sign to let you go on a field trip––they are approving your going on the trip.</li><li>Permission has the same Latin root word as permit. They both come from permittere, which means to allow to go or pass through. Permission can be given in writing, it can be given orally, or it can be assumed or unspoken––by passing the box of cookies around the room you're giving everyone tacit permission to help themselves.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1013,"<ul><li>To pour is to flow rapidly in a steady stream, or to cause something to flow. You can pour good coffee into a cup and pour bad coffee down the drain.</li><li>You can pour your heart out, pour a cup of orange juice into or out of a cup, or watch the rain pour down while a poem pours from your lips. A jet of water may pour from a spout. Listen to how the water pours in this poem from Lewis Carroll's book, Alice in Wonderland: “How doth the little crocodile / Improve his shining tail, / And pour the waters of the Nile, / On every golden scale!”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1014,"<ul><li>Something that's raw is uncooked. A ripe raw tomato tastes very different from one that's slowly roasted with olive oil.</li><li>Raw food isn't heated, and while raw fruits and vegetables are usually delicious, raw eggs and meat can be dangerous. When you use the word raw to describe things that aren't edible, it generally means ""in a natural, untreated state,"" like raw silk or raw wood. You might also have raw feelings or raw emotions — these are basic and out in the open. The Old English root is hreaw, ""uncooked,"" from a Germanic source.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1015,"<ul><li>A satellite is something small or less powerful that orbits around something bigger. It often describes a body in space, such as an artificial satellite that orbits the Earth and beams down signals that power devices like cell phones.</li><li>The word satellite was first used to describe a follower of someone in a superior position. The word's meaning later broadened to describe anything small that's dependent on something larger. The small satellite circles around the more powerful force, like a moon orbiting a planet. Satellite can describe a small country — a satellite country — controlled by a larger one, or a large organization that has a small office — a satellite office — in another location.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1016,"<ul><li>A scale is a series that climbs up or down. Think of scaling, or climbing, a mountain; a musical scale: do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do; or a scale you weigh yourself on––it counts up the pounds one after another after another.</li><li>Scale can be a ratio too––when maps are drawn ""to scale,"" that means one mile of real road might translate to one inch of road on the map. Even fish scales can be understood this way––they repeat the same shape row after row after row. You can also rate something using a scale: ""How much do you love pizza? Rate it on a scale of one to ten, with one being blech and ten being amazing.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1017,"<ul><li>When you skip, you do a little hop from foot to foot as you move along. It's pretty common to see little kids skip down the sidewalk or across the playground.</li><li>While a happy, running hop is one kind of skip, you can also use this verb to mean ""pass up"" or ""pass over."" You might arrive late to the movies and skip the trailers at the beginning, or skip the bread basket at a restaurant so you have room for dessert later. The earliest meaning of skip, from the 1300's, is ""to spring lightly,"" from the Old Norse root word skopa.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1018,"<ul><li>To stretch is to extend or lengthen something beyond the normal length. You stretched both your vacation and the truth when you called out of work on Monday saying your flight home from Ibiza was canceled.</li><li>Stretch is a word that has many great usages. The sense of extending one’s limbs came about circa 1200. Four hundred years later brought the phrase ""stretch your legs,"" meaning take a walk. Don’t walk too vigorously, though, or you could stretch a muscle. The word can also be used as a noun, meaning an expanse, as in, ""Looking toward the horizon, the thirsty man saw an endless stretch of sand.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U21_1019,"<ul><li>A telescope is an instrument that is used to view distant objects. If you want to look at the planets, you can use a telescope. The higher the magnification on the telescope, the better your view will be.</li><li>Galileo is often credited with the invention of the telescope, but this is incorrect. Although he didn't invent it, he did improve it — a lot. He didn't name the telescope either; Greek mathematician Giovanni Demisiani did, in 1611. Telescope is from the Greek roots tele.""far,"" and skopos, ""seeing;"" so it literally describes what the instrument does. As a verb, telescope means ""to become smaller through one part sliding into another,"" the way a portable collapsing telescope does.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U22_1021,"<ul><li>On a clock, the alarm can be set to go off at a certain time to wake nearby sleepers. You should always check the alarm on the clock at a hotel because a previous guest may have it set to go off in the middle of the night.</li><li>The noun alarm refers to a signal that is meant to rouse, alert, or awaken someone. On April 18, 1775, William Dawes, Paul Revere, and several others rode from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts to raise the alarm that the British were coming. As a verb, alarm means to be filled with anxiety or apprehension. You may become alarmed if your children become too quiet. Never a good sign — they are probably up to something mischievous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1022,"<ul><li>To arrest someone is to put them in custody for breaking the law. If you face arrest, your criminal activities will be ""at rest"" because you'll be behind bars, or in jail.</li><li>Arrest is both a noun and a verb. When you place a person ""under arrest,"" you take them into custody and hold them so they can’t continue breaking the law. A police officer or other agent of the law will arrest a person often by physically taking them away. In addition to the legal meaning, arrest means ""stop."" To arrest motion is to stop a person or thing from moving.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1023,"<ul><li>The noun award refers to a prize of some kind that indicates you’ve done well and achieved an honor. The verb form of award describes giving out one of these honors. So your teacher may award you the Math Genius award.</li><li>Award can be something given out by a court of law. For example, a judge might give you a monetary award when you win a lawsuit. Award can also be something you get when you're the big winner. The state lottery commission might award you $35 when you hit the lottery. Award comes from the Old English word weardian, meaning “guard” — which is exactly what you should do with that $35.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1024,"<ul><li>To breed is to have babies, whether you’re a human or a hermit crab. A breed is also a specific type of a domesticated species, like a poodle or Great Dane.</li><li>The word breed comes from the Old English bredan which means to ""bring young to birth,"" but also ""cherish,” which is how most people feel about their offspring. Awwwww. But the fact is that breeding is reproducing. Also, a breed is a strain or stock of a species, such as a Siamese cat. There are many types of dog breeds, cow breeds, and even pig breeds. Members of a breed usually look and behave in a similar way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1025,"<ul><li>An open, round container with a handle is a bucket. You might take a bucket and shovel to the beach for making sand castles.</li><li>Buckets are usually made of metal or plastic, and are typically used to carry liquids. A dairy farmer might catch milk in a metal bucket, announcing at the end of the morning, ""I got six buckets of milk!"" The expression ""to kick the bucket"" means to die — this particular meaning might stem from the French buquet, ""balance,"" a beam that was used for hanging slaughtered animals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1026,"<ul><li>A contest is a struggle to determine who's tops –- you might wrestle an alligator in a contest of brute strength versus strategy. You can also enter a contest — a yodeling contest or a cake-decorating contest, depending on your talents.</li><li>If you're being sued and you respond to the court order saying ""no contest,"" you're saying you're not going to put up a fight. When you put the accent on the second syllable, contest becomes a verb, and it means to dispute something. You lost the election for class president, but you think there was something fishy going on at the ballot box, so you contest the results and ask for a recount.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1027,"<ul><li>A convict is a person who has been found guilty — convicted — of a crime and is serving a sentence in prison.</li><li>When you convict (accent on the second syllable) someone of a crime, you find them guilty. The person is then a convict (accent on the first syllable). When the person is released from jail, he's an ex-con, that is, he's not a convict any more.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1028,"<ul><li>A festival might be an all-day series of music performances or a weekend of short plays or films. Any program made up of many different acts, especially lasting an entire day or several days, can be called a festival.</li><li>Another meaning of the word festival is ""big party,"" again most often a celebration that lasts for a long period of time. Some festivals are religious, and others are seasonal or cultural, like a city's Italian Heritage Festival. Some famous festivals include the Fringe Festival in Scotland, Carnivale in Brazil, Oktoberfest in Germany and Burning Man in the United States. You could travel the world as a festival hopper.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1029,"<ul><li>A garage is a building that's meant for keeping cars or other vehicles in. Some houses have attached garages with automated doors.</li><li>You might have your own garage, or you might pay to park your car in a large public garage down the street. The two buildings are very different — one large enough for one or two cars, and the other possibly accommodating hundreds — but they're both garages. You can also use the word garage for a car repair shop: ""I have to take my car to the garage because it's making a weird noise.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1030,"<ul><li>A journalist is a person whose job involves writing nonfiction stories for newspapers, magazines, or online news sites. If you are reading or hearing a news story, you have a journalist to thank for providing that story.</li><li>One type of journalist is a reporter, who researches topics and interviews people before writing a story or producing a piece for TV. Editors, photographers, and columnists can also be described as journalists, particularly if they work for a newspaper. Another kind of journalist is a person who regularly writes in a journal or diary. Journalist comes from the Old French jornel, ""day"" or ""day's work,"" which became journal, ""daily publication.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1031,"<ul><li>Even though you probably think of a young, cuddly dog when you hear the word pup, a pup is the correct name for the young of many different mammals (even the not-so-cuddly porcupine!).</li><li>When your dog has babies, they're pups, and the same is true of baby wolves. What's more surprising is that so are the baby anteaters in the zoo, as well as the offspring of sea lions, gerbils, and mongooses, among others. Sometimes this noun is also used to mean a young person who's particularly naive or arrogant. Pup comes from puppy, from the Middle French poupée, ""doll.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1032,"<ul><li>Make sure you know the context when using the word qualify. In one sense, it means to be right for, to measure up. In another sense, though, qualify means to change something slightly, to limit it or add a condition to it.</li><li>If you want to qualify for your driver's license, remember not to drive through that final stop sign without stopping. I guarantee you that if you don't stop you will not qualify. You don't just get your Eagle Badge. You have to qualify for it—there's a lot to do before you get it. The word might be used in its other sense like this: If you plan to get married, keep your vows simple: say ""I do."" Don't qualify them by saying something like ""I do...except sometimes, when I don't."" If you have to qualify your wedding vows, don't get married.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1033,"<ul><li>To repair means to fix or mend something so that it is in good working order again. If you forget to put oil in your car and you blow the engine, it's going to cost you an awful lot to repair it.</li><li>Not only does repair describe the act of fixing something, it can also be used as a noun for the fixing itself, as in “Who did the repair on this house? It looks terrible!” In a totally different meaning, if you repair somewhere, you return back to or go to a place for rest or shelter. If you're outside and it begins to rain, you might want to repair to the house where it's dry.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1034,"<ul><li>If you resume something, you start it again after stopping. You might resume singing an aria after breaking to spit out your gum.</li><li>Resume is from Latin resumere ""to take up again, take back,"" from the prefix re- ""again"" plus sumere ""to take up, take."" The Latin verb sumere is formed from the prefix sub- ""under, up"" plus emere ""to take."" When you pause a movie or game and then you press play again, what you're really doing is resuming play.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1035,"<ul><li>To rob is to steal something using violence (or the threat of violence). A criminal might rob a bank by pretending to have a weapon.</li><li>Use the verb rob when you're talking about a crime — like when a bandit robs a train in the movies, or an outlaw robs the general store on TV. You can also use it to mean ""deprive,"" as in ""Having to ride my bike to school is only going to rob me of my energy by the time I get there."" Rob comes from the Old French rober, ""rob, steal, or ransack.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1036,"<ul><li>When you slip, you slide or skid unintentionally. A slip is also a kind of underwear you wear under a skirt. A Freudian slip, on the other hand, is a slip of the tongue.</li><li>You can slip on a damp or icy surface, and you can also slip by making a mistake or getting worse, as in ""If the company doesn't sell more candy, their profits will slip."" It also means ""move in a sneaky or quiet way,"" so you might slip out of a birthday party before cake is served. As a noun, a slip can be a mistake, a fall, a piece of something (especially paper), or a skirt-like type of underwear.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1037,
4000EEW_B02_U22_1038,"<ul><li>When something is stable, it's fixed and steady. If you needed advice, you'd probably go to your most stable friend, the one least likely to act crazy or be easily upset.</li><li>Whether you're talking about an object or a person, the adjective stable implies reliability and strength. You can describe a government as stable, or a relationship, or a desk. A completely different meaning of stable is the noun ""building used for housing horses or other animals."" Both senses of the word come from the Latin stabilis, ""firm or steadfast.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1039,"<ul><li>Tissue is part of the body of a living thing that is made of similar cells, like the cardiac tissue of your heart. A tissue is also a soft, thin piece of paper used for wiping noses and tear drops.</li><li>The noun tissue comes from the Old French word tissu, meaning “a ribbon, or belt of woven material.” In fact, as a verb, tissue means ""weave fabric strands."" Today, we think of tissues as the disposable paper for blowing our noses or packing presents. A different kind of tissue is found in the body — the groups of cells that have the same job, like scar tissue that protects a wound as it heals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U22_1040,"<ul><li>The grassy area right outside a house is a yard. A yard is often surrounded by a fence or marked by shrubs or other plants. As a unit of measurement, a yard is equal to three feet.</li><li>Most suburban houses have both a front yard and a back yard — sometimes side yards too. Yards might have grass, trees, bushes, play structures, gardens, patios, and decks. A completely different kind of yard is the unit of measurement that equals three feet. This three-foot yard comes from a Germanic root meaning ""rod or staff,"" while the yard behind your house has a root that means ""to enclose.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1041,"<ul><li>Nothing is better than the best — this is a word for the absolute number one example of something. Best is the opposite of worst.</li><li>People love arguing about who's the best at different things. Most people think Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of all-time, and Wayne Gretzky is the best hockey player ever, but there's not much agreement on who's the best football player or baseball player. Best has other meanings too: If you defeated someone, you bested them. People also use this word to recommend something, as in ""It would be best to get a lot of sleep.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1042,"<ul><li>A card is a thick, often square or rectangular piece of paper. A schmoozer might hand you a business card, or you might send your mom a Mother’s Day card, or perhaps you’ll play poker with a deck of cards.</li><li>There are many different kinds of cards, from birthday cards to flashcards for studying vocabulary words before a big test. Cards are traditionally made from a light cardboard or heavy weight paper, although you probably also have plastic cards like an ATM card or a library card. To card someone is to ask for an identification card. The Greek root of card is khartes, ""layer of papyrus.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1043,"<ul><li>A lot of people or things in a large group make up a crowd. The masses of performers with painted faces, big shoes, and squeaky noses filling up the streets during your town's annual clown parade can be described as a crowd of clowns.</li><li>A crowd of people might gather for a party, concert, or demonstration, with the word crowd implying that there's something a little disorderly — noisy or unruly — about the group. Crowd can also mean ""the mass of ordinary people,"" which is the way you're using the word when you say you want to ""stand out from the crowd."" You want to be seen as a distinct, individual person, rather than part of a larger mass of regular folks.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1044,"<ul><li>A day is a 24-hour period, or the length of time it takes the Earth to rotate fully on its axis. There are 365 days in a year, and 31 days in the month of January.</li><li>Most work weeks last five days, and an ordinary weekend gives you two days of freedom before you go back to work or school. Day can also mean the opposite of night, or the time when the sun is up and you're awake. If your grandpa starts his stories with, ""Back in my day..."" he means an era or a period of time in the past. The Old English root, dæg, means both ""day"" and ""lifetime.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1045,"<ul><li>A dish is something on which you serve, cook, or eat food. You need an extra large dish to make a casserole big enough to feed your entire extended family.</li><li>You can use the noun dish to talk about the enamel, ceramic, metal, or plastic vessel your food is in, and you can also use it for the food itself. You might say, ""This macaroni and cheese was my great aunt Mathilda's favorite dish."" When you serve it, you can say that you ""dish it out"" — although figuratively, this also means ""administer punishment.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1046,"<ul><li>The adjective easy can describe anything that comes without too much effort, like your baseball team's easy win, or your dad's easy recipe for nachos.</li><li>Something that's easy isn't at all difficult — it just seems to fall into place. There's also a sense of slowness, casualness, and a lack of worry, like getting an easy ""A"" in your History of Hip Hop class. Easy comes from the Old French word aisie, ""comfortable, rich, well-off,"" an easy way to live indeed. The only thing about easy that's less than simple is remembering to change the y to an i for variations like easier and easiest.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1047,"<ul><li>If you experience something, you go through an unusual or exciting event. If you're experiencing the world's loopiest roller coaster, you'd better hope that the amusement park doesn't experience a power outage.</li><li>Sometimes experience means accumulated knowledge and sometimes it refers to a single spectacular event. If you have experience in cooking, you have worked in a restaurant before. Learning by experience is a method of acquiring knowledge by doing and not by reading. On the other hand, when you come back from summer camp, your mom will want to hear about your experiences. And white-water rafting is quite an unforgettable experience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1048,"<ul><li>When you're on vacation, one place you can stay for a nightly fee is a hotel. Most hotels provide accommodations for sleeping, with minibars, pools, and ice machines to keep you entertained.</li><li>While in Australia and New Zealand a hotel can also be a bar or a pub, most English-speakers recognize this word as the equivalent of an inn. Simple hotels give you a bed to sleep in and a bathroom to use, while fancier hotels might have beautiful furnishings, separate sitting rooms, swimming pools, and cafes. In the 1760s, hotel was defined as ""an inn of the better sort.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1049,"<ul><li>An hour is a unit of time — it's sixty minutes, 3,600 seconds, or the length it takes the long hand on your watch to move in a full circle.</li><li>If your math class lasts an hour, it might start at 9:30 and end at 10:30, one hour later. Hour also means ""time of day."" If your phone rings at two a.m., you could ask, ""Why are you calling at such a late hour, Mom?"" The word stems from the Old French hore, ""one-twelfth of a day,"" with its roots in the Latin hora, ""hour"" or ""season,"" and Greek hora, ""the season.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1050,"<ul><li>It's pitch black in your room so you switch on the lamp, and your room is filled with light. Light is a source of illumination, whether a natural one (like the sun) or an artificial one (like your lamp).</li><li>Like light itself, the word can take a lot of different forms — it can be a noun, an adjective, or a verb, and it can mean ""bright"" or ""not heavy"".  No matter how you define it, though, the word comes from the Old English word leoht.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1051,"<ul><li>Market is both a noun and a verb that have to do with selling. Companies that successfully market potato chips make people buy a big bag at the market.</li><li>Are you in the market for a new pair of jeans? That means you are looking to buy. You might be the market, or likely customers, for a certain brand. The cost of those jeans will be whatever the market can bear, meaning the most profit that can be made, either by selling fewer pairs at high cost or lots of pairs at a lower cost. But if you buy them on the so-called black market, you might get a bargain price — only to find your new jeans aren't authentic — knock-offs of the real thing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1052,"<ul><li>Do you have an idea of what you want and have thought carefully and in detail about how to get it? Then you have a plan, a series of actions required to achieve a particular goal.</li><li>A plan can exist only in your head, or it can be a physical object, such as an architectural plan of a building, showing how you propose to build it. As a verb, plan means the act of thinking about how to achieve your aims. You might plan to apply to colleges soon. When you plan something, you're laying the seeds for a future result, so it's not surprising that plan comes from the early English word plante, meaning ""seedling.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1053,"<ul><li>The price of something is how much it costs. It’s usually money, but sometimes not. For example, the price of staying up all night is that you’re really sleepy the next day. Wake up!</li><li>You can use the noun price to mean the money exchanged for an item or service — or use it figuratively, to mean ""something negative that's required in exchange for something positive."" If you hear the phrase ""a small price to pay,"" think of this figurative meaning. You could say, for example, that having clouds of pet hair all over your house is a small price to pay for your wonderful cat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1054,"<ul><li>Short describes something that is not as long as usual. If your childhood bed is too short for you, your feet will dangle over the edge, and if a school day is short, you'll get out early.</li><li>The adjective short describes things that aren't long when you measure them, or have a small distance from one end to another, like your short hair or the short walk to the library. A small amount of time can also be described as short, like a short chat with your mom. As a verb, short can describe cheating someone out of money or not paying what is owed, like a friend who shorts you when the lunch bill arrives.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U23_1056,"<ul><li>A station is a regular stopping place, like a bus station, a train station, or even a radio station.</li><li>To understand all the jobs the word station has, check out its past — station comes from the Latin stationem for ""a job or position,"" via the word stare which means ""to stand.” A station can be where trains “stand,” or a police station where police do their job. Your station in life is your social place. It’s also a verb — like when the military stations troops to protect a border.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1057,"<ul><li>A surprise can be an unexpected or astonishing event, such as an ambush or a really great grade on a test you didn't study for.</li><li>Surprise can be a verb meaning to astonish or startle someone, a noun for the unexpected thing, or for the feeling produced by that surprise.  It comes from the Latin word for ""seize,"" and originally meant an unexpected military attack.  When the novelist Charles Lever wrote in 1841 of ""three cavalry regiments, their noiseless gestures and perfect stillness bespeaking at once that they were intended for a surprise party,"" he meant a surprise attack, not a birthday party.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1058,"<ul><li>A system is a group of things that connect and form some kind of coherent whole. All the individual buses and the separate routes they take through your city are together called a bus system.</li><li>Any time various separate things act together in some organized way, you can call the entire group of interconnected things a system. Your veins, arteries, and heart together make up your body's circulatory system, and the group of planets which rotate around the sun are called a solar system. The Greek word systema, or ""organized whole,"" is where system originates.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1059,"<ul><li>Running late? Call a taxi. A taxi is a car you hire to drive you somewhere. In some big cities, all you have to do is raise your hand and yell ""taxi!"" and a taxi will pull up next to you.</li><li>You can also refer to a taxi as a cab or a taxicab. Most taxis are cars, although boats for hire are sometimes also called taxis. As a verb, taxi describes what airplanes do when they move very slowly on a runway. Officially, taxi is short for taximeter cab, as they were originally named at the turn of the 20th century. Today the taximeter, which records distance and fare, is usually just called a meter.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U23_1060,"<ul><li>Two is a whole number that's greater than one, but less than three. If you found one fuzzy mitten and then your friend gave you another one, you would have two mittens — perfect for your two hands.</li><li>In a deck of cards, there are four twos — one in each suit. In most games, the two is considered the lowest card. Two can also be used as an adjective to describe anything that numbers one more than one. In cards, if you have a pair of twos, you have two twos. This spelling of two always refers to a number and shouldn't be confused with the homonyms ""to"" or ""too.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1061,"<ul><li>The action of soaking or washing yourself in water is a bath. You might take a bubble bath to relax before bed after a stressful day.</li><li>Your soak in soapy water is a bath, and the tub in which you're lying is also a bath. Other containers of water are baths too, particularly in cooking: ""If the custard's sitting in a hot water bath, it will cook more evenly."" While the Old English root bæð means ""immersing in water,"" it also means ""immersing in mud."" If an investor ""takes a bath,"" it means, colloquially, that she loses a lot of money.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1062,"<ul><li>To bend is to curve. You can bend physically, as when you practice yoga, and also figuratively, the way you do when you ""bend over backwards,"" working hard to make something happen, especially on behalf of another person.</li><li>Tree trunks and branches are able to bend when they're whipped by strong wind — this way, they're usually able to avoid breaking. A bend in the road is a curve, and to bend the rules is to change them slightly in a specific instance. If you try to do a backbend, you have to arch or bend your spine and lean back until her head hangs down and your hands touch the floor. It's a move for the young and flexible. The Old English root, bendan, specifically referred to bending or stretching a bow.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1063,"<ul><li>When you chew, you use your teeth to grind up food before you swallow it. It can be pretty unpleasant to watch your brother chew his pizza with his mouth open.</li><li>Usually when people chew, they chew up a bite of food or chew on a candy bar. You can also chew your nails or chew your lower lip — you're not actually eating something, but just using your teeth to gnaw or bite. You can also use the word chew figuratively, to mean ""think or mull over."" It comes from an Old English root, ceowan, ""to gnaw or chew.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1064,
4000EEW_B02_U24_1065,"<ul><li>The adjective fantastic has two meanings — extraordinarily brilliant or ludicrously far-fetched. So when your boss calls your suggestion of work-at-home-in-your-bathrobe-Fridays for the whole office fantastic, be sure you know which one he means.</li><li>We get fantastic from the Latin phantasticus, meaning “imaginary.” Sometimes it’s still used that way: If you call a unicorn a fantastic beast, you’re not paying it a compliment; you’re saying it exists only in fairy tales. Most often, though, fantastic means strikingly out-of-the-ordinary. It can be complimentary (""You got an A? Fantastic!"") or disparaging (""He was always foolishly unrealistic, but trying to reach the moon using a balloon tied to his bicycle was his most fantastic idea yet."").</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1066,"<ul><li>A fiction is a deliberately fabricated account of something. It can also be a literary work based on imagination rather than on fact, like a novel or short story.</li><li>The Latin word fictus means “to form,” which seems like a good source for the English word fiction, since fiction is formed in the imagination. Like its literary cousins fable, legend, and myth, however, fiction has a slightly darker additional meaning: a deliberate lie or untruth. When we talk about ""the line between fact and fiction,"" we're talking about the difference between truth and lies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1067,"<ul><li>A flag is a piece of cloth that represents a country, group, or institution. If you're particularly proud of your Irish heritage, you might fly an Irish flag in your front yard.</li><li>A real flag enthusiast might fly the American flag, their state flag, their city's flag, and the flag of their parents' birth countries. There are also flags used for signaling on ships at sea and during races and sporting events, and flags that represent armies or advertise products. When flag is used as a verb, it means ""to lose energy or enthusiasm."" When students start to flag in the afternoon, they tend to take a quick nap — sitting up at their desks.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1068,"<ul><li>When you inspect something, you look at it carefully. When you're buying a used car, you should inspect it inside and out, and if you don't know much about what goes on under the hood, you should have a mechanic inspect it, too.</li><li>Inspect means literally ""to look into,"" and includes the Latin root that you find in lots of other words related to ""look"" — spectacle, respect, and spectator for instance. If you work in a restaurant, you may see a health department official come to inspect the operation, to make sure everything is clean and the food is stored and cooked properly and that the restaurant doesn't have any health code violations that might make your diners sick.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1069,"<ul><li>If you keep a daily––or at least somewhat regular––written account of your life, you are keeping a diary or journal. A journal is also a periodical, such as a scientific journal or a scholarly journal.</li><li>Journal comes from an Old French word which meant daily (jour being the French word for day, as in soup du jour, or “soup of the day”). You can keep a journal in an old notebook, on the computer, or on scraps of paper, but if you keep it in a book made especially for that purpose, then that physical book (whether you've written in it or not) is called a journal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1070,"<ul><li>In everyday use, liquid is the opposite of solid––water at room temperature is a liquid: Heat it to boiling, it turns to a gas. Chill it below freezing, it turns to ice.</li><li>Liquid describes a state in which a compound such as water flows. Juice is a liquid. Milk is a liquid. Your swimming pool is full of liquid. When assets are liquid, that means they can be liquidated easily, i.e., sold for cash. Stocks and bonds are liquid assets. Real estate, which can take a long time to sell, is considered illiquid.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1071,"<ul><li>The Latin source of the word marvel is mirari, ""to wonder at,"" and that's exactly what marvel means when it's a verb. You may marvel at the depth of the Grand Canyon or at the size of a piece of cake.</li><li>When it entered the English language in 1300, marvel meant ""miracle"" –- that is, a supernatural act of divine agency (miracle actually comes from the same Latin word as marvel). By 1386, Geoffrey Chaucer was able to use the Middle English meruailles to describe more mundane astonishment. Chaucer also used marvel –- maruaylen, actually –- as a verb. In contemporary usage, the close synonym wonder is used much more often –- unless you happen to be a fan of the comic book universe created by Stan Lee. As a noun, anything that provokes wonder is a marvel.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1072,"<ul><li>Use the verb overcome when you talk about someone who has triumphed over adversity. It's great to see a friend who's always struggled in school overcome his learning disabilities and make the honor roll.</li><li>You can also be overcome with emotions, or overwhelmed by your feelings. Many people feel so overcome with sadness at a movie — or happiness at a wedding — that they regret not bringing a pile of tissues with them. The verb overcome also means to win or surpass. If you are going to win the marathon, you are going to have to overcome the five runners still ahead of you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1073,"<ul><li>When you recall something, you remember it, like telling your friend, ""As I recall, you said you'd buy my lunch the next time we got together.""</li><li>The verb recall means ""remember,"" like an older person who recalls her school days, or ""call to mind,"" like a painter's use of colors and shapes that recall early Pablo Picasso. Recall can also be a noun — you may know someone who has great recall, or memory, of events that everyone else has forgotten. If an automaker issues a recall on your car, this is a request to temporarily ""take it back"" to fix something. Don't forget about this kind of recall!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1074,"<ul><li>To regret something is to wish it had never happened. Wish you hadn't reached for that fourth piece of chocolate cake? You regret it.</li><li>Regret is often called a useless emotion, because you can only regret what has already taken place. It's too late to change things, so all that's left to do is regret. Regret can also function as a noun, as in the feeling of regret you have when you realize that you should have been nicer to your kid sister and should have not locked her into the dog crate for the afternoon. You often hear people exclaim ""No regrets!"" when they talk about their life choices, but we're dubious because who doesn't have at least one horrible outfit in their memory that makes them cringe with a feeling of regret?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1075,"<ul><li>The noun soul can mean an individual human being, but it can also mean essence of a human being. If you believe the soul is immortal, you believe that even when your physical body dies, some other part of you lives on.</li><li>Soul shows up in various forms in all Nordic and Germanic languages, but no one knows where it originated, just like the whole idea of the soul. Philosophers and theologians have debated the exact definition of soul for ages, but it always stands for that ineffable part of a human unlimited by the body, the grandest, deepest part. Soul music is a popular form of gospel, and if you ""have soul,"" you really feel what it is to be alive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1076,"<ul><li>If you have a sufficient amount of something, it's enough — not too much, not too little, just right. Goldilocks would be pleased.</li><li>Sufficient comes from a Latin verb meaning ""to meet the need."" If something is sufficient it has met, or satisfied, a need. Enough is often used as a synonym for sufficient, and when something is not sufficient, it is too little to take care of what's needed. Sufficient can, however, also suggest just enough and not an abundance, as in ""the money was sufficient for groceries, but we needed more to fill the gas tank.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1077,"<ul><li>Surgery is a medical procedure, usually involving an incision and instruments. A surgery is done to fix or prevent a health problem.</li><li>There are a lot of kinds of surgery in the world. Some are very serious, like brain surgery and heart surgery. Others are minor, like getting your appendix removed. In most cases, you'll be unconscious for surgery, to make it easier for the surgeon to get the job done. You can also call the room where surgeries are done a surgery, and talk about the field of surgery.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1078,"<ul><li>The adjective tough is good for describing hard times. If you just got mugged, lost your job, got the flu, and broke your toe, you're having a really tough week.</li><li>Tough means ""strong, hard, unbending,"" and you can use it to describe many different things, like a tough exam, or a tough piece of beef jerky, or a tough day that you just want to be over. If a judge punishes criminals harshly to set examples, she's ""tough on crime."" We call people toughs if they seem likely to beat you up. Tough things are made to withstand a beating, like the tires on your mountain bike. Pronounce: TUFF.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1079,"<ul><li>A tube is a pipe shape, a cylinder with a hollow space inside. If you're like most people, you sip your milkshake through a straw — a long, plastic tube.</li><li>Chemists use glass tubes in labs, and plumbers work with pipes — tubes made of plastic and metal. Another kind of tube is the rubber one inside a tire. If you slide down a snowy hillside on an inflated tire tube, or ride through choppy water while sitting on one, you can also use tube as a verb. Though it's not true in the US, in London the subway is also familiarly known as the Tube.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U24_1080,"<ul><li>When you value something, you consider it important and worthwhile. For example, if you value someone’s opinion, you will ask that person's advice before making a big decision.</li><li>Value has to do with how much something is worth, either in terms of cash or importance. As a verb, it means ""holding something in high regard,"" (like ""I value our friendship"") but it can also mean ""determine how much something is worth,"" like a prize valued at $200. The noun value also relates to worth, like a used car that is a good value, the value of good health, or the ideals we have, like ""My values include honesty and fairness.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1081,"<ul><li>An atom is the basic unit of an element. When you see the chemical formula for water, H2O, it's telling you that each molecule of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.</li><li>In science class, you've probably come across atoms, the bits that make up molecules. Less scientifically, the word atom can also mean a very small piece of anything at all. The Greek root of atom is atomos, which means ""indivisible,"" since the scientists who first gave the atom its name imagined it couldn't be split or divided into smaller pieces. Even though we know there are smaller things that make up an atom (protons, neutrons and electrons), it's still a good way to think about the word atom.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1082,"<ul><li>The adjective beautiful describes a thing that is pleasing to the senses. A field of wildflowers, a colorful sunset, and an abstract sculpture could all be considered beautiful.</li><li>The word beautiful is closely related to the words beauty and beautify, and you'll notice they all share the same beginning, beau-. Almost anything can be described as beautiful because, as the saying goes, ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."" So while you may think the brown spotted grass frog is unattractive, a scientist who spends all day studying them may think it's beautiful.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1083,"<ul><li>If you measure the distance of an object from side to side, you are measuring the object’s breadth: “Theodore measured the breadth of the table before buying it to make sure it would fit in his small kitchen.”</li><li>Breadth often refers to a physical measurement, but it can also be used to describe comprehensiveness or largeness of any kind, such as breadth of knowledge or breadth of experience. In the famous sentence describing Macedonian king Alexander the Great, the word breadth is used to indicate the vastness of Alexander’s empire: “When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1084,"<ul><li>A comet is a small, icy object that orbits the sun and has a long ""tail"" of gas. Some comets can be seen from Earth every few years, while others pass by once in a person's lifetime.</li><li>Comets are made of ice, dust, and tiny pieces of rock, but to people on Earth, they look like streaks or smudges across the night sky. When the Earth's orbit takes it through one of these comets' tails, their dust burns up in our atmosphere and results in a meteor shower. In Old French, the word was comete, ultimately from a Greek root, kometes, which literally means ""long-haired star.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1085,"<ul><li>To cover something is to conceal it by putting something on top of it. In many religions, it's important for people to cover their heads in various instances.</li><li>You might cover your picnic table with a bright tablecloth for a party, or cover the mirrors in your house when you're mourning a family member. Gardeners cover their beds with mulch or compost, scattering a layer on top, and painters cover dingy old paint with a fresh new coat. If a politician covers something up, he attempts to hide some mistake or wrongdoing. When cover is a noun, it can mean ""a lid"" or ""a secret identity.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1086,"<ul><li>Despair is the feeling of not having any hope left. If you completely forgot to study for your final exam in math, you might feel despair when your teacher passes out the test.</li><li>Despair can also refer to someone or something that causes you to worry or be sad. Unfortunately, some children are the despair of their parents. The verb despair means to lose hope. Despair is from Latin desperare ""to be without hope,"" from the prefix de- ""without"" plus sperare ""to hope,"" from spes ""hope.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1087,"<ul><li>The way something (or someone) is shaped or arranged is its form. You might use it to describe the way a person looks walking in the woods at dusk by saying, ""Her form was almost lost between the shadowy trees.""</li><li>Physical objects have a form, and so do less tangible things like music, movies, and stories. When form is used as a verb, it means ""to give shape to,"" as when a filmmaker works to form the narrative of her movie so that it makes sense to the audience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1088,"<ul><li>A fragment is a small piece that’s come off a larger whole, and to fragment is to break. If your teacher writes ""frag"" on your paper, you've got an incomplete sentence.</li><li>Fragment, meaning ""a tiny, brittle shard,"" first appeared as a noun and later as a verb. That afternoon you hacked away at the fireplace in your parents’ living room in search of secret treasure as a child? Those dusty chunks of brick you scattered all over their shag carpet were fragments of a once-intact wall, and a happier time before you were grounded. Not only did you cause physical damage that day, but you also fragmented their trust in you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1089,"<ul><li>A galaxy is a collection of stars and planets that are held together by gravity. In a galaxy, the celestial bodies rotate around a central object.</li><li>The Earth's galaxy is known as the Milky Way. Our solar system, made up of the Sun and the planets that encircle it, is a tiny part of that galaxy. A galaxy can also refer to a gathering of a lot of sparkly people –– like celebrities or sports stars. What gravity holds this galaxy together? Usually cameras.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1090,"<ul><li>Gloom is a hazy darkness or dimness. The gloom of a moonless autumn evening is perfect for trick-or-treating, but not so perfect for sizing up your candy stash.</li><li>It might make you nervous to walk in the gloom of your friend's rural neighborhood at night if you're used to well-lit city streets. And while gloom perfectly describes the near-dark of dusk or a foggy evening, it can also describe a dark, dismal mood. Your brother's gloom when his favorite basketball team loses in the playoffs will only deepen if your favorite team wins the tournament. Gloom is a Scottish word, originally meaning ""a sullen look.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1091,"<ul><li>Large means the size of an item, such as clothing, that falls between medium and extra-large. If you realize your size has changed from medium to large, it might be time to cut back on the cupcakes.</li><li>Something that is above average in size or number can be described with the adjective large. Your large collection of bottle caps, which covers the walls of three rooms in your house, is a perfect example. Large also describes something that covers a broad spectrum or scope. You might love being an American studies major because your classes cover a large range of topics.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1092,"<ul><li>Werewolves love to howl at a full moon. The moon is our planet’s satellite, and it rotates around the earth and reflects light from the sun. Also, “to moon” means to show your rear. The moon is out! Giggle giggle.</li><li>The earth has just one moon, but the word moon can mean any natural satellite of any planet. Astronomers have discovered many moons — there are more than 160 in our solar system alone. Poets have been fascinated by the moon for a long time, and ""to moon"" also means ""to act in a dreamy or aimless way."" Our months are marked by changes in the moon's phase, and the Proto-Indo-European root means both ""moon"" and ""month.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1093,"<ul><li>When something radiates, it sends out waves or rays. The sun radiates light and warmth.</li><li>If your house has a radiator, that might help you remember this word, because the radiator radiates warmth. Radiating is a concept that applies to anything that emits rays or waves. People camping make a fire so it can radiate light and heat. Our bodies radiate some heat, but not nearly as much as something as hot as a stove. If a nuclear reactor is damaged, it could radiate dangerous nuclear energy — or radiation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1094,"<ul><li>When you wander without a plan or a specific destination, you roam. Your cat may stay close to your house when you let her outside, or she may roam around the neighborhood all day.</li><li>Dogs and kids on bikes tend to roam in packs, looking for food or fun, while a tiger in the zoo roams aimlessly around his enclosure. Book characters' eyes sometimes roam, too, or glance over a scene without stopping: ""Her eyes roam across the group, but there are no familiar faces."" Experts have tried connecting roam to ""pilgrimages to Rome,"" but there seems to be no relation between roam and Rome.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1095,"<ul><li>If you're a lone wolf, a one-man band, a rugged individualist, or an island unto yourself, you prefer to be solitary — in other words, alone or single. The term can be used to describe a person, a place, or a thing.</li><li>Solitary comes to us from the Latin solus, which means alone. Note its similarity to words like solo and, for all you card players out there, solitaire. You can take a solitary walk, during which you don't utter a solitary word, but pause to admire a solitary green shoot peeping through the snow. Solitary is also common in the prison world: Inmates on Alcatraz who were deemed too dangerous to mingle with their fellows were put in solitary confinement cells.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1096,"<ul><li>A spectrum is a broad range of similar things or qualities, like the wide spectrum of political beliefs in this country, ranging anywhere from super conservative to über-liberal and everything in between.</li><li>Our modern definition of spectrum started out in the 1600s, when scientists used it to refer to the band of colors formed by a beam of light, like a rainbow. In physics, it’s a word that describes the distribution of something, like energy or atomic particles. We still use those scientific meanings today, but spectrum can also apply to non-science related groupings or ranges of related things.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1097,"<ul><li>Marbles, oranges, bubbles, and beach balls — all of these objects illustrate the shape of a sphere, or globe (unless the beach balls are under-inflated, in which case they’re sort-of a “squished-sphere” shape).</li><li>Sphere is often used metaphorically to refer to a particular aspect or area of something. For example, unless you’re a trained circus performer, tightrope walking and fire swallowing probably lie outside of your sphere of expertise. Sphere frequently occurs in the phrase “sphere of influence,” which designates the geographical area over which a person, organization, or nation has control. In many households, whoever is in charge of the cooking controls the kitchen; so, the kitchen falls within his or her sphere of influence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1098,"<ul><li>A star twinkles in the night sky. To put it more scientifically, it’s a celestial body of hot gases radiating energy. A star is also a person who dazzles — the star of the show or the star archaeologist.</li><li>If you're starring in a Broadway show, your name gets top billing — you've got the biggest part or maybe you're the best known performer, the actor people are wild to see, the one with the most ""star power."" If you believe in fate or astrology, you might ""thank your lucky stars"" for your good fortune. Star is the same root as the Greek aster, as in asterisk — a star symbol.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1099,"<ul><li>If someone wants to know the status of something, they want to know what condition it's in, where it is, or how much progress it's made. You've probably checked the status of your flight to see if it's on time or delayed.</li><li>Status doesn't only apply to the state of flights, projects, and traffic jams — it also can be used to refer to a person's social standing or rank. In fact, status was first used in reference to someone's height, and later, their legal standing. Someone with VIP status gets to fly first class and probably has a bunch of photographers following them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U25_1100,"<ul><li>Ugly means ""extremely unattractive."" On Halloween, some people wear ugly masks as part of their scary costumes.</li><li>Anything that looks or feels quite unpleasant is ugly. The adjective ugly can describe the way something or someone looks, but it can also describe behavior or actions — the ugly scene your little brother made at the toy store when he didn't get what he wanted or the ugly breakup of a friendship.  Remember that when ugly becomes uglier and ugliest, the y becomes an i.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1101,"<ul><li>If you charge someone with misdeeds or misconduct, you accuse that person. If the last piece of devil's food cake is missing, your sister may accuse you of eating it — especially if you have chocolate on your mouth.</li><li>The verb accuse comes from the Latin word accusare, which itself is formed from the roots ad, meaning toward, and causa, reason or lawsuit. ""Cause,"" ""excuse,"" and even ""ruse"" are all from that same root word. Today, if you're accused of a crime, you may still be headed toward a lawsuit. However, to accuse someone of a crime doesn't necessarily make them guilty — plenty of people have been falsely accused.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1102,"<ul><li>When you adjust to something, you change so that you can fit in, conform, or keep on going. Arriving at a new school almost always requires that you adjust a little. Once you adjust, you'll find you're as happy as you were in your old school.</li><li>To adjust doesn't mean to transform in a major way. It implies small but important changes that make a big difference. If you adjust your speed by just ten miles per hour, you'll get more than fifty more miles per fill-up. You can adjust your hair to make it fancier, you can adjust your lifestyle to make it more sober, or you can adjust your attitude to make yourself less annoying. You used to have to adjust your TV antenna to get a better picture. Ask your mom.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1103,"<ul><li>If you enjoy making people laugh, you like to amuse them, which is a good trait to have as long as you don't amuse people during a math test or other solemn occasion.</li><li>The verb amuse also means to keep busy in a pleasant way. You might amuse yourself during a long driving trip by playing the alphabet game, where you try to find all the letters from A to Z on roadside signs. If you are a passenger on a plane, you could amuse yourself with a movie on your computer. Just don't get them mixed up and try to watch a movie when you are driving.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1104,"<ul><li>Coral is a marine polyp with a calcareous skeleton that lives in colonies. You probably last saw coral while scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef. That or while looking at the coral necklaces in the beach shop.</li><li>Though coral looks like stone with little holes, it is actually a kind of sea polyp with a stony, hole filled skeleton. Sometimes the word coral refers to the skeleton itself. Because of the red color of Mediterranean coral, coral is also an adjective meaning pink-red. Shakespeare wrote: “My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more “red than her lips' red.” Coral can also be a noun for unfertilized lobster eggs that turn red when cooking.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1105,"<ul><li>Cotton is a plant that grows the soft, fluffy fibers that are used to make the fabric also known as cotton. Cotton grows best in very warm climates.</li><li>Cotton is a hugely important fiber, since it's used to make all kinds of clothing, bedding, and other things we use regularly. Your t-shirt, jeans, underwear, and socks are probably all made, at least in part, from cotton, and so is your bath towel, pillow case, and the curtains on your windows. If you use cotton as a verb, it's an informal way to say ""take a liking to."" This meaning has a Welsh root, cytuno, ""agree.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1106,"<ul><li>Boom! Bam! Pow! A crash is when two things collide, or smash, into each other. Crash and smash have similar meanings and sounds.</li><li>You can start to worry when you  hear the word crash. Many people die in car and airplane crashes every year. Other crashes are less physical yet just as bad. In a stock-market crash, a lot of people lose a lot of money. You can also use crash as a verb. You'd better not crash your bike into the coffee shop window! If your computer crashes, you will probably lose all the data in it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1107,"<ul><li>A deck is a platform or a section of floor on a ship. If you're on a cruise with your family, you might tell your brother to meet you on the upper deck after lunch to play shuffleboard.</li><li>Most decks are open, without a roof, and positioned high on a ship . Typically, the bridge deck houses the ship's helm and navigational tools. The deck behind your house isn't much different from a ship's deck — it's a flat platform too. Other kinds of decks are a pack of cards, the board part of a skateboard, and the floor: ""Hit the deck!"" To deck a person is to hit them, but to deck your house is to decorate it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1108,"<ul><li>Engage means to bind, catch, or involve. If your sink is stopped up, engage, or hire, a plumber to fix it. Otherwise the smell of rotten food in the garbage disposal will engage your attention (in a bad way).</li><li>Engage comes from a French word for pledge. If you agree to marry your sweetheart, you are engaged to marry. If you engage the kid next door to water your plants, she will expect to be paid for it. Engagement is also used to talk about war or conflict. An army engages its enemy in battle, just as you might engage in debate with a traffic cop over whether the light was yellow or red.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1109,"<ul><li>The adjective firm describes something that's strong and unwavering. If your great Aunt Martha had a firm belief that children should be seen and not heard, you and your siblings might have spent your childhood driving her crazy.</li><li>Something that is solid can also be described as firm. When you take a stick of butter out of the fridge, it's firm, and it needs to soften before you cream it with sugar. Another definition for the adjective firm is unwavering or loyal. You might be a firm supporter of your favorite baseball team, even though they haven't made it to a World Series in more than twenty years.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1110,"<ul><li>What do you and your car have in common? You both run on fuel. Whether its gasoline or nutritious food, fuel produces energy to get up and go.</li><li>Fuel can also act as a verb that has several different meanings, all related to stimulating something or providing energy. Your brother might fuel up on whole-wheat bread with peanut butter a few hours before a big game. A teacher assigns readings to fuel meaningful class discussion. Memories of your mom's delicious dinners might fuel your desire to learn to cook.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1111,"<ul><li>Something that's grand is large and impressive. A fancy, catered birthday party with a guest list of hundreds could be described as grand.</li><li>The adjective grand can be used in many different ways: it can describe big things, like a grand piano or the Grand Canyon, or luxurious things, like the grand leather seats in your dad's Cadillac. You can also use grand to simply mean ""wonderful,"" as when you exclaim, ""Chocolate cake for dessert! Isn't this grand!"" Grand is also a slang term for ""a thousand dollars."" The Latin root is grandis, ""big, great, full, or abundant.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1112,"<ul><li>A hurricane is a severe tropical storm with high winds and heavy rain. When a hurricane comes through your town, you should board up the windows and stay inside.</li><li>Hurricanes have sustained winds that rotate in a circle, which is why they are often referred to as cyclones. The worst hurricane in recent years in America was Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005 and devastated the city. The word hurricane comes from the Spanish word huracan. Interestingly, the Old English dictionary has 39 spellings for the word based on English-Spanish-Portuguese hybrids.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1113,"<ul><li>If you no longer have something, you experience a loss, like the loss of a favorite sock. When something lessens, or gets smaller, that's also a loss, as in weight loss.</li><li>Loss has lots of opposites that help define what it means. It is the opposite of win, gain, found, or earn. You can take a loss in a game or a race or by misplacing or just plain losing something like a cell phone or money. When a business has more expenses than it can cover in sales, that, too, is called a loss. A difficult loss is when a friend, relative, or pet dies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1114,"<ul><li>Plain things are simple, unadorned, and even a little boring. Being a plain talker means you don't use pretentious, fancy words. But having a plain face means you're not much to look at.</li><li>Plain comes from the Latin word planum, meaning ""level ground."" That's one meaning of the word, as in a flat prairie or low lying coastal flood plain. If something is in plain view, it's out in the open with no obstructions. But usually we use plain as an adjective to describe unembellished, bare, or unimpressive things. A white room with just an old bed and a chair is pretty plain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1115,"<ul><li>A reef is a raised area on the ocean floor that's made of rock, coral, or sand. If you are a scuba diver, head to a coral reef to check out the diverse marine life.</li><li>A barrier reef is one that surrounds an island and creates a lagoon between the reef and the beach. When this type of reef attracts diverse ocean life, it can be popular with snorkelers and scuba divers. When you're sailing, a reef is a section of the sail that you can roll up when necessary — and to reef is to roll up a reef. Both meanings share an Old Norse root, rif, ""ridge under the water.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1116,
4000EEW_B02_U26_1117,"<ul><li>Strict describes someone who sticks to a particular set of rules. If your math teacher is strict, it means that she expects her rules to be followed to the letter.</li><li>The adjective strict always has to do with rules. Your strict parents enforced rules and expected you to obey them. Your cousin might be a strict vegetarian who always follows her own rules about what to eat. Strict laws demand to be followed, and a strict follower of the First Amendment supports free speech no matter what. The Latin root of strict is strictus, which means ""drawn together, tight, or rigid."" A rigid adherence to rules is exactly what makes someone strict.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1118,"<ul><li>The surf is what you see when you stand on the beach and look at the ocean — waves rising and breaking on the shore. It’s also what you do when you ride those waves. Surf’s up, dude!</li><li>Surf means ""crashing waves,"" but it's also a verb meaning to ride those waves with a surf board. When you surf, you stand upright on a board and ride over breaking waves into the shore. A more figurative meaning of surf is ""search casually,"" as in ""channel surf,"" or click idly between TV stations. The origin of the word is a mystery, though it's thought to have first been used in reference to the Indian coast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1119,"<ul><li>A task can be big or small, easy or really hard — but it's never more than a job that needs to get done.</li><li>Chop chop! There's a task that needs completing, and you're just the person for the job. If you're smart though, you'll figure out a way to task someone else with it, or assign it elsewhere. Task comes to us all the way from the Latin word taxare, which in its earliest days meant ""to impose a tax on."" So much like the filling out of your tax forms, most tasks are considered chores.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U26_1120,"<ul><li>A zone is an area that has some special characteristic, like a loading zone.</li><li>""The Twilight Zone"" was a TV show where odd things happened. Similarly, any zone is a place that has some special feature. A loading zone is a spot where cars and trucks can unload things and people. A military zone is a place under control of the armed forces. To create a zone is called zoning: zoning breaks something into parts or sections. An election board zones an area into separate zones such as districts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1121,"<ul><li>An apology is what you say or do when you want to let someone know (or fool them into thinking) that you regret something.  An apology is nice, but chocolates or large bundles of cash are nicer.  Always.</li><li>The noun apology has its roots in the Greek apologos, meaning a story. It entered the English language in the Middle Ages.  If you broke your friend’s sword and then made up an elaborate story to get out of trouble, that was an apology.  After a few decades, the general sense of the word shifted to its current meaning — what you say when you want to express real remorse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1122,"<ul><li>Someone who's bold is daring and brave. You might show how bold you are by climbing onto the roof of your house, or by speaking up when you see someone being treated unfairly.</li><li>When you act in a bold way, you're taking some kind of risk; you could be risking physical danger, embarrassment, or your reputation. Whatever bold actions you take, they are confident and fearless. The adjective bold can also be used to describe a particular typeface that is thick, dark, and confident. Bold type is usually used to emphasize something strongly in writing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1123,"<ul><li>A bug is an insect. You might refuse to go camping because of your intense dislike for bugs. Bug can also be a verb meaning ""annoy."" Most likely, bugs bug you.</li><li>There are bugs you can see, like bees, and bugs that are much smaller, like viruses and bacteria. If you get one of these microscopic bugs, it means you're sick. You can also say, casually, ""I've caught the model train bug — I'm hooked!"" A microphone that's hidden in someone's home or telephone is also a bug, named after its small size. To bug someone means either to spy on them, or simply to bother them relentlessly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1124,"<ul><li>The verb to capture means to grab, trap, or take something that doesn't want to be grabbed, trapped, or taken. Hunters, pirates, and kidnappers all capture the things they want.</li><li>If you want that tiger, you're going to have to capture him, either by setting a trap or shooting him. Either way, his capture won't be easy. You can also capture a photograph of something — which, while it doesn't mean taking it against its will, is still a kind of taking in which the thing itself is not participating. The pirate captured his hostages, while his hostages captured the scene on their cell-phone video cameras.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1125,"<ul><li>A duke is a member of a royal or noble group. In some places, dukes rule over certain regions, while in others duke is just an honorary title.</li><li>In the U.K., a duke inherits his title from his parents. Prince William, for example, is the Duke of Cambridge, while his father Prince Charles is the Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay. The equivalent title for a woman is duchess. Informally, duke has a very different meaning in the U.S. — if you ""duke it out,"" you have a fight, and to ""put up your dukes"" means to clench your fists and get ready to punch.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1126,"<ul><li>To expose means to uncover or allow to be in the open air. If you take off your coat and expose your bare arms to the terrible cold, your tattoos might freeze off. (Note: We don’t actually know if this is physically possible.)</li><li>When you pronounce expose as it’s spelled, it can mean to leave out in the air, to put in peril (when you expose someone to danger), or to uncover. All of those examples are actions. However, when you pronounce it as though there is a French accent on the final ""e,"" ex-poh-ZAY, it means the unmasking or exposure of something hidden (and usually bad or fraudulent), as when you watch an expose on 60 Minutes about the evils of frozen orange juice or some other toxic substance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1127,"<ul><li>Someone guilty has done something wrong or illegal. And when you do something wrong, you feel guilty — bad or sorry — about it.</li><li>The police are responsible for finding out who’s guilty of a crime so they can be arrested, convicted, and punished. But you can also be guilty of smaller, more legal things, like cheating on a test, breaking the rules of a game, or thinking awful things. If you’ve done it, then you’re guilty of it: so if someone asks if you have a crush on your swim instructor, you can say “guilty!”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1128,"<ul><li>When you hire someone, you invite them to work for you or the company you represent. If you manage your local ice cream shop, it might be part of your job to hire extra ice cream scoopers for the busy summer season.</li><li>Your boss at the animal shelter might hire you immediately if she's desperate for help — or if you impress her as a true animal lover. Once she does, she can call you ""a new hire,"" or a recently hired employee. It's less common in the U.S. than in Britain, but you can also say you hire a car when you rent or lease one. Hire comes from the Old English hyr, which means both ""wages"" and ""interest.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1129,"<ul><li>You may think your fluffy white cat is just an innocent, or harmless, little kitty, but she shows no mercy when attacking that toy mouse.</li><li>Innocent is an adjective that describes someone or something that is not harmful or at least doesn’t cause harm on purpose. It can also be used when talking about a person who did not commit a crime. “Innocent until proven guilty” is a phrase that means people who have been accused of a crime should be considered innocent, or free of blame, unless a judge or jury decides that they are officially guilty.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1130,"<ul><li>A language is a system of words and grammar used by a group of people. When we write and speak, we're using language.</li><li>Animals have amazing forms of communication, but the unique thing about people is our ability to use language. There are hundreds of languages in the world, and you might be learning a second language in school. A dictionary is an important tool in learning a language, but the grammar — how a language is put together — is a lot more complicated. Sign languages are languages too. You can also say that music and math have their own language.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1131,"<ul><li>You might meet a minister of the religious kind — a pastor or a rector. Or, you may meet a minister of the government kind — a prime minister or a minister of finance, for example.</li><li>You don't have to be religious to minister. When you minister to someone, you take care of them. All of these meanings of minister — both as a noun and as a verb — contain a grain of the original Latin meaning, ""servant."" A minister in a church serves his or her flock, and a prime minister serves his or her country.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1132,"<ul><li>Something ordinary is something that happens every day. Maybe you should skip your ordinary breakfast and try something new.</li><li>Although we often use the adjective ordinary to mean ""ho-hum, nothing special,"" it actually comes from the Latin root for ""rule."" You could think of ordinary things as almost like rules in your life. As a noun it has other meanings. In heraldry (that's the art of the family shield), an ordinary is a conventional figure. A probate judge is called an ordinary, as is the clergyman who prepares prisoners for death.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1133,"<ul><li>Something that’s permanent is constant and lasting, as opposed to temporary. Think twice about writing in permanent marker or getting a tattoo — both are just about impossible to erase.</li><li>If you wait around for something permanent to change, you'll be there for a long time — maybe forever. That's because the adjective permanent is used to describe something that continues on into the foreseeable future without shifting, moving, or changing at all. You might also come across the noun permanent, which refers to a chemical treatment used to curl your hair. But please know that ""perms"" aren't really cool anymore.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1134,"<ul><li>When you preserve something, you maintain its condition, like trying to preserve your good health by exercising regularly and eating right.</li><li>The verb preserve describes keeping something as it is now, without a decline in quality. It can also refer to keeping something safe from harm, as in “The group worked hard to preserve the regional ecosystem.” When you preserve food, such as fruit, you keep it from rotting. Jellies and jams are preserves, the noun form. A preserve can also be lands set aside, or preserved, as animal habitats.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1135,"<ul><li>If you have a teacher who asks the class to call him ""Mr. B,"" it's probably because his name is really hard to pronounce. When you pronounce a word, you sound it out.</li><li>When you say something in a particular way, you pronounce it. The verb pronounce has another meaning, too — ""to declare formally."" It's not too different from announcing something, but it implies something more official and solemn — just think of the phrase ""I now pronounce you husband and wife.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1136,"<ul><li>Have you noticed that many pet owners resemble their pets? Or is it that pets resemble their owners? Either way, it’s downright strange how they often look alike.</li><li>Derived from the old French word sembler, “to appear,” the verb resemble can imply a whole spectrum of likeness. For example, you might closely resemble your schnauzer or, hopefully, only vaguely resemble each other. It’s not just about appearance, either. This concept can include all kinds of characteristics. Two companies can resemble each other and the same could be said of two philosophies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1137,"<ul><li>A symptom is the result or byproduct of something else—specifically, the result we use to prove that that other thing exists. Simple example: a cough is a symptom of a cold. We know we have a cold because we have the symptom, a cough.</li><li>Don't confuse the symptom with the cause. Even when the symptom is worse than the cause, don't be tempted to confuse them. Fever, sneezing, achiness: all of these are symptom of a cold. But they are not the cold. They are symptoms of it. Relationship experts argue over whether ""cheating” is the cause of unhappiness or the symptom. In other words, do people think about breaking up because of cheating, or do they cheat because they're thinking about breaking up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1138,"<ul><li>Tobacco refers to the leaves of the tobacco plant that have been dried and processed for people to roll up and smoke. Tobacco is the main ingredient in cigarettes, and of course, chewing tobacco.</li><li>Tobacco was used for fun in the Americas way before the Europeans came, but it was cultivated in France in the 1500s, and is still going strong. The word tobacco probably came from the Caribbean. The name Tobacco Road is from a novel by Erskine Caldwell, but is used to describe a section of North Carolina that produced a lot of tobacco. Tobacco is mainly used in cigarettes, which are really bad for your health.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1139,"<ul><li>When mammals have two babies at once, each of them is a twin. If you have a twin brother or sister, the two of you are always the same age.</li><li>There are identical twins, who have the same DNA, and fraternal twins, who are more like two siblings who happen to be born at the same time. It's more common to describe humans as twins than other animals. The adjective twin can also describe a pair of things, like the twin chocolate cakes you serve at your birthday party or the ""Twin Cities"" in Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U27_1140,"<ul><li>A witch is a person with magical powers. Most towns have a spooky old woman with a lot of cats who all the neighborhood kids suspect of being a witch.</li><li>The classic picture of a witch is a woman dressed in black with a tall, pointy hat, a broom, and an ugly face — this kind of witch is a popular Halloween costume. Another kind of witch is a serious believer in the religion called Wicca. The word witch is also used to describe someone who's old and unattractive — or, conversely, a young enchantress, a girl capable of bewitching a man.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1141,"<ul><li>The verb accompany means to keep someone company, or to be their companion on a trip or journey. In a musical sense, accompany means to play background music for the lead singer or soloist.</li><li>If you want your friend to keep you company on your way to the store, you could ask her to accompany you on the walk. Or, if you want your friend to play piano while you sing a song, you could ask her to accompany you on piano. Just don’t ask her to do both at the same time or your friend may not want to accompany you anywhere any longer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1142,"<ul><li>When you kick off your shoes to walk on the beach, you are enjoying the feeling of your bare feet in the warm sand. The adjective bare describes something or someone that is naked or unclothed.</li><li>Bare can be used in many different ways: to describe the inside of your nearly-empty refrigerator, an uncarpeted floor, or your unadorned, sparsely decorated bedroom. The word bare can also be used as a verb meaning ""to uncover or expose."" When you reveal deep truths about yourself to another person — imagine confessing your passion for stamp collecting to a girl you like — you ""bare your soul.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1143,"<ul><li>A branch can mean the ""arm"" of a tree, or any other kind of arm––a branch of a bank is a division of the bank.</li><li>Branch also works as a verb. If you play soccer every day after school and you want to ""branch out"" athletically, you might consider playing tennis. You might turn onto a little road that branches off a main one. A branch of a river is called a tributary.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1144,"<ul><li>Breath is the process of taking air in and out of your lungs. It’s also the air you inhale and exhale, or a slight movement of air, like a breeze.</li><li>Breath comes from the Old English braeth (“scent"" or ""smell”). Many figures of speech originate with the idea that breathing deeply energizes or calms us. You can ""catch your breath"" by slowing down, and you might ""take a breath"" by taking a break or walking away from a stressful situation. A ""breath of fresh air"" might be just that, or, metaphorically, it might signal the arrival of something new and different that invigorates us or refocuses our attention.</li></ul>"

The bridge of your nose connects your nose to your head — it's where the bridge of your eyeglasses rests.</li><li>If you insult your boss and quit your job, you've ""burned your bridges"" — you can’t go back. If you're not going to worry yourself about a possible problem, you can say ""I'll cross that bridge when I get to it."" The vertical piece that holds the strings up on a violin, guitar, or other stringed instrument is also a bridge, and in a song, the bridge is the part between a verse and the chorus — the transition between them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1146,"<ul><li>A cast is the group of actors who make up a film or stage play. And the act of being chosen for the part? Well, they were cast by the director. That's showbiz for you.</li><li>Cast also refers to various types of actions a person can take: if you throw out a fishing line in a particular way, you are said to cast it; if you fancy your chances in Vegas, you cast the dice at the craps table. And if you break a limb and they bandage it up in solid plaster for your friends to write all over? That, too, is a cast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1147,"<ul><li>When you challenge or provoke someone to try something risky, it's a dare. If you accept a dare, you're probably trying to prove how brave you are.</li><li>When you challenge your friend to a dare, you dare him. You might, for example, dare your brother to jump off the garage into a pile of leaves. Another way to dare is to actually be brave: ""I admire her so much, because she dares to stand up to bullies."" The Old English root of dare is durran, ""to brave danger, venture, or presume."" If you say, ""How dare you?"" you're expressing outrage or indignation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1148,"<ul><li>Electronic things work because of electricity that's transmitted using tiny parts. The keyboard you play in your band is electronic, and so is the calculator you use in math class.</li><li>The adjective electronic describes machines and devices that require electrical currents to run, and that use microchips and transistors to direct that current. There are electronic parts in many areas of our lives — cars use electronic devices, and so do computers, radios, televisions, and cell phones. Electronic instruments like synthesizers have lead to an entire genre of music that's also known as electronic. The word itself was first used in the 1930's to mean ""pertaining to electrons.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1149,"<ul><li>An inn is a place to stay while you're on vacation or on the road. Inns are usually smaller and more charming than hotels, but they serve the same purpose: to give you a place to rest your weary head as you travel.</li><li>Some inns are more charming versions of hotels, while others use the word inn simply to make them sound more appealing than a motel. The original meaning of inn was ""lodging and food for travelers,"" although today some inns don't have a restaurant or bar attached. If you own or manage an inn, you're an ""innkeeper."" Inn comes from the Old English inne, ""inside or within.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1150,"<ul><li>A net is a device, made of fabric or rope stitched together, used to catch things such as fish or butterflies. Net can also refer to profits.</li><li>There are many nets, but two kinds have to do with catching things and making profit. The first net is like a fisherman's net: it's a type of meshing (meaning it has holes) made from rope or wire. This net is used to catch fish, and the holes allow the water to pour out. Also, someone's net worth is how much money they have. A net profit is a company’s earnings. A larger net means more money.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1151,"<ul><li>The noun philosophy means the study of proper behavior, and the search for wisdom.</li><li>The original meaning of the word  philosophy comes from the Greek roots philo- meaning ""love"" and -sophos, or ""wisdom."" When someone studies philosophy they want to understand how and why people do certain things and how to live a good life. In other words, they want to know the meaning of life. Add the suffix -er to philosophy, and you get a word for someone whose job it is to think these big thoughts.</li></ul>"

One tiny sunflower seed can potentially grow into a sunflower that's ten feet tall.</li><li>Some seeds are just a tiny speck, others a small pod, and still others a cluster inside a fruit. As a verb, seed means ""remove the seeds from,"" so you can seed a lemon or a pomegranate (and in the latter case, you can then eat the seeds you've seeded). You also seed when you scatter seeds in a garden. Figuratively, seed is often used to mean ""provide money to start a business"" or ""help something grow.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1154,"<ul><li>Something with a thin edge or a fine point that can cut is sharp. It's painful when your dog climbs into your lap, poking you with his sharp toenails.</li><li>A knife and a pointed stick are sharp, since they can pierce or cut, and a piercing pain in your neck is also sharp. You can also use sharp to describe a smart person or clever decision — or someone who dresses well, or the clothes such a person wears. Sharp also means clear, like sharp images in a book of black and white photography, or sudden, like a sharp turn in a mountain road.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1155,"<ul><li>A sort is a type or a kind of something, or the act of categorizing things. If you’re an organized sort of person, sort your clothes by color. If you’re the disorganized sort, just chuck them all over the floor.</li><li>The noun sort can mean a category or example, or even a type of person, as in ""My sister is a generous sort."" As a verb, it means ""organize, categorize, or resolve"" like when you sort your earrings by size or your math teacher helps you sort out what went wrong on the latest test. Sort comes from the Latin sortem, ""share or portion"" and also ""fate or destiny.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1156,"<ul><li>In math, when you subtract, you take one number away from another. If you subtract four from ten, you're left with six. You can also use subtract to mean ""take away"" in a more general sense, as in ""If you subtract some of the salt from the recipe, the pasta will be healthier.""</li><li>When you're doing math, you know you're supposed to subtract if you see a minus sign. Subtracting gives you the difference between numbers, and you can see this in a real way when you subtract actual objects instead of numbers. If you have a dozen cupcakes and subtract ten of them, you have only two cupcakes left. The Latin root of subtract is subtrahere, ""take away or draw off.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1157,"<ul><li>If something is closed or fastened so firmly that it can barely be moved, it's tight. And if you accidentally shrunk your favorite pair of jeans in the wash, they might be tight too.</li><li>There are many ways to use this handy adjective, including to mean ""very firm,"" like the tight grip you keep on your dog's leash, and ""strictly imposed,"" like a movie star's tight security. If things in your household are tight, they're scarce: ""Money's tight this month, so it's peanut butter for lunch."" And if you and your cousin are tight, it means you're emotionally close to each other.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1158,"<ul><li>The adjective virtual is used to describe something that exists in essence but not in actuality. You may have made a virtual friend on an online gaming site, but don't expect that person to meet you for coffee.</li><li>Although virtual can be used to describe anything that exists in effect, but not in fact, it is often used to describe things created in a computer or online world. ""She enjoyed playing the virtual role-playing game with her online friends."" Virtual can also be used to mean ""almost"" — as in, ""The blizzard brought the city to a virtual standstill, with subway and bus passengers stranded on the sidewalks.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U28_1159,<ul><li>To weigh is all about judging; you could be seeing how heavy something is or if it is a good choice. You could weigh the tomatoes you're buying or weigh your options when applying to college.</li><li>To weigh something can mean to physically assess its weight — is it 3 pounds? 40 kilos? 22 grams? But it's no accident that the symbol for justice is often a scale. That's because all of the facts of a case need to be weighed or evaluated for justice to be served. And hopefully the decision will be balanced and fair.</li></ul>

When teachers talk about using your outside voice (when you're outside) and your inside voice (for speaking normally), the whisper is even quieter than the inside voice. This word can apply to other sounds too: you could say the wind is whispering. Whispers really do sound a lot like ""Psst psst psst"" to anyone who can't hear the exact words. You're likely to hear a lot of whispering in the library.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1161,"<ul><li>Use the adjective abstract for something that is not a material object or is general and not based on specific examples.</li><li>Abstract is from a Latin word meaning ""pulled away, detached,"" and the basic idea is of something detached from physical, or concrete, reality. It is frequently used of ideas, meaning that they don't have a clear applicability to real life, and of art, meaning that it doesn't pictorially represent reality. It is also used as a noun, especially in the phrase ""in the abstract"" (a joke has a person laying down a new sidewalk saying ""I like little boys in the abstract, but not in the concrete""), and as a verb (accented on the second syllable), meaning ""to remove.""</li></ul>"

An annual holiday party should be a time for fun, but it also can be a sad yearly reminder of the passage of time.</li><li>An annual event happens every year: ""I always forget to take sunglasses to my annual eye exam and am left wearing those horrible disposable shades."" Annual earnings are made over the course of a year: ""His annual income is on a steady decline.""  And an annual plant lives for only a year: ""My neighbor Shirley always plants the most garishly bright annuals instead of more subdued perennials."" Whether it's eye exams, income, or plants, you can expect to see something annual again in about 365 days.</li></ul>"

You can mold clay into different shapes when it's wet.</li><li>Clay is terrible for planting a vegetable garden, but it's perfect for making pottery, tiles, or bricks. You can shape damp clay into a bowl or a cup, and when it's dried and fired in a very hot oven, it becomes extremely hard and sturdy. The Old English root of clay is clæg, ""stiff, sticky earth.""</li></ul>"

When you sew your own clothes, you start with a piece of cloth.</li><li>Cloth is made from some sort of fiber, often cotton or wool, or a synthetic like rayon or polyester. Your clothing is made from cloth, as are the curtains in your house, your favorite tote bag, and the table cloth in your kitchen.

4000EEW_B02_U29_1166,"<ul><li>We deserve things based on our actions. For example, many people believe murderers deserve the death penalty.</li><li>Deserve is used in many ways, but it always carries a sense of balance or justice. If someone receives an award for their work, it means they deserve praise and attention. If you deserve a day off, it means you've been working hard and have earned a vacation. If you threw a book during class, you deserve a punishment of some kind. Many laws — and lots of arguments — are about deciding what different people deserve. It's often hard to tell.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1167,"<ul><li>A feather is one of the soft, fringed plumes that cover the bodies of birds. Some feathers are tiny and downy, while others are large and brilliantly colored.</li><li>Feathers are the main characteristic that separates birds from all other animals. Scientifically, feathers are described as growths or appendages that form on a bird's skin — but this definition can't capture how lovely feathers are. When feather is a verb, it usually means to turn or rotate an oar, paddle, or propeller so that it's parallel to the surface of the water.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1168,"<ul><li>The word fertile means ""able to reproduce,"" but like so many words, that's just the beginning. The fact that she gave birth to eight kids was proof that she was fertile; her fertile imagination explained their unusual names.</li><li>The distance between fertile's literal meaning (able to make babies) and its figurative ones (productive, prolific, full of potential) is small. A child's mind is a fertile place; an idea can grow there very easily. Rabbits are famously fertile creatures; they can spawn several generations in a matter of months. And ""fertile ground"" can be arable land or a situation that provides the perfect opportunity. The Latin root, fertilis, means ""bearing in abundance, fruitful, or productive,"" from ferre, ""to bear.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1169,"<ul><li>A flood is an enormous amount of water. If the street is full of water, it's flooded. Too much of anything can also be called a flood.</li><li>Whenever it rains and rains and rains, there's the danger of a flood, a type of disaster where water is out of control. Because a flood is so powerful, people use the word when overwhelmed by other things. A top college graduate could be flooded with job offers — that's a good kind of flood. People can also be flooded with emotion. Words with similar meanings are deluge and overflow. Too much — or just a lot — of anything can seem like a flood.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1170,"<ul><li>The chairs, tables, sofas, and beds in your house are furniture. Your furniture gives you somewhere to sit, store your books, and a comfortable place to sleep at night.</li><li>Furniture can be defined as the things in your house that you can move around — you can rearrange the furniture in your living room to make room for a piano, for example. Humans have been building and using some form of furniture for thousands of years. Furniture comes from the Middle French fourniture, ""a supply,"" or ""an act of furnishing.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1171,"<ul><li>A grave is the place where a body is buried. Usually, a grave is dug in the ground, and a stone with information about the deceased person marks its location.</li><li>Grave is used as an adjective, too. It can describe something serious, or of great importance. If a situation is grave, it is serious and sad, like when a loved one is very sick. Grave can also refer to something that causes fear or anxiety. If you are in grave danger, your personal safety is threatened. If you have a grave personality, you are solemn and dignified and don't joke around very much.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1172,"<ul><li>An ideal is a model of something perfect or without equal. As an adjective, ideal describes this ultimate standard for excellence, or something that exists only as an idea.</li><li>When we talk about what's ideal, we often refer to a best-case scenario (it would be ideal if you were well-rested before your exam); what we're striving for (it would be ideal for all children to receive an education); or some idea of perfection (the ideal date would be dinner with your favorite movie star). If you have high ideals, you have very strong beliefs about what is good and right, and maybe even how best to save the world.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1173,"<ul><li>Intelligence is your ability to comprehend something, like calculus or why plants grow toward the sun.</li><li>Intelligence comes from the Latin word intelligere, ""to understand,"" which makes sense because it refers to someone's ability to understand things. Your intelligence helps you pass math class and learn French. It means smarts — what you need at least some of to get through school. Intelligence has an exciting double life: it also refers to what spies are trying to get — information from the enemy. You can be born with it, or acquire it, especially if you're in the CIA.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1174,"<ul><li>Obtain means to get something that is not so easy to come by such as knowledge, rights, or a large amount of money. You wouldn't say you obtained a pair of pants, unless they were one of a kind.</li><li>At times in its history, obtain has meant to be victorious or to succeed. Today, it mostly means to acquire, but keeping its prior meanings in mind helps you to use it in the right way. College degrees are something that you obtain as is permission from your parents to go to a party. When you obtain something, you have worked hard to get it, so you are pretty happy to have it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1175,"<ul><li>Religious, besides meaning ""having to do with religion,"" can also mean ""acting as if something is a religion."" If you have never missed a broadcast of your favorite TV show for the last five years, then you're religious about it.</li><li>Just as religion is a broad concept with multiple manifestations, the word religious can be used in many contexts. You could literally be describing someone's particular religious duties as prescribed by his religion. If you have a religious temperament, you think about spiritual things a lot. If someone is a fanatic about football, you could describe him as a religious fan. That doesn't mean he thinks the football is God, just that he really, really cares.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1176,"<ul><li>If something is romantic, it isn't very practical, like the librarian's romantic dream of convincing every person in town to read a book a week for life — a great idea that probably isn't possible.</li><li>To be romantic about something can mean that you overlook its flaws and shortcomings. If your romantic ideal is growing all of your own food on a secluded farm, you are probably ignoring the tremendous amount of hard work it will require. Or, if you are romantic about love, you believe the perfect person is out there and in finding one another, all the problems and difficulties of life will melt away.</li></ul>"

The largest turtle shell is nearly 10 feet wide!</li><li>Most shells are made of calcium carbonate, and they grow along with the animal. Bird embryos are nestled inside shells, and nuts have shells too. Other uses for shell come from the biological meaning. A rifle shell has a shell-like metal casing. An empty structure, with only walls, is the shell of a building. And to ""come out of your shell,"" means to emerge, like a turtle, from your shyness.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U29_1178,"<ul><li>The land right at the edge of a lake, river, or ocean is called the shore. Even the bravest swimmers will head for the shore when they hear someone yell ""Shark!""</li><li>The verb shore means ""prop up or support,"" so you might shore up a house that's tilting on its foundation or shore up a failing company with an investment of money.  The water's-edge shore has a Germanic root that means ""cut,"" and experts believe that the noun shore grew either from a sense of ""division between land and water,"" or possibly ""land cut off from the mainland by marshes.""</li></ul>"

Many caterpillars are striped and colorful.</li><li>A caterpillar is officially the larva, or immature form, of a flying insect — generally, a butterfly. Because caterpillars are growing rapidly, they tend to eat constantly, and for this reason they're considered pests by gardeners and farmers. The word caterpillar comes from the Old North French caterpilose, literally ""shaggy cat,"" from the Late Latin catta, ""cat,"" and pilosus, ""hairy"" or ""shaggy.""</li></ul>"

Your kitchen cupboard might actually be full of cups, while the cupboard in your bedroom might hold sweaters and socks.</li><li>Some cupboards are built into a wall, like a closet, while others are freestanding cabinets. A cupboard usually has doors that open and shelves inside, for storage. The very earliest cupboards, in the 14th century, were exactly what the word describes: a board or table used for putting cups or dishes on. Over the following two hundred years, cupboard came to mean an enclosed cabinet for the same purpose.</li></ul>"

A delicate balance. A delicate child. A delicate lace design. A delicate taste. Sometimes the word implies intricate beauty and at other times fragility. Delicate can have negative overtones: A delicate situation is a tricky one. A delicate balance describes an agreement that might turn sour any moment. A delicate child may cry easily. But delicate can also refer to things that are very lovely and hard to reproduce: a delicate lace collar on a dress stands out. A delicate flavor, like pomegranate peach mint sauce, makes salad — or vanilla ice cream — much more delicious.</li></ul>"

You might hope to emerge from an epic perming session looking like a beauty queen, but chances are it will just look like you got electrocuted.</li><li>From the Latin emergere, meaning to “rise out or up, bring forth, bring to light,” emerge is an intransitive verb that might bring to mind the image of a whale rising up from the depths of the sea, or of a person popping out from a dark corner to spook you. Appear and peep are synonyms, while dip and sink are antonyms.</li></ul>"

Handicaps can also be imposed artificially to even out the odds in sporting events.</li><li>A sporting handicap might be a faster horse carrying an extra weight, or a better golfer having a few strokes added to her score to make things more competitive. Sometimes fate imposes a handicap, as when bad weather handicaps your travel plans, or a strike handicaps the subway system. Handicap comes from the term hand in cap, an ancient British practice in which two bettors placed their money into a hat held by a neutral third party before a bet.</li></ul>"

When you're talking casually with friends, you can also call a place that's small or dumpy a hole, like a rundown town or a really tiny apartment.</li><li>The word hole comes from the Old English hol meaning ""cave"" which in prehistoric times wasn't just a dark space to hide, it was a home.

You can also hop into and out of things, or up to or down from a height: ""Hop in the car, let's go!""

Today, when you pursue someone, it's not necessarily with bad intentions. A police officer, for example, might pursue a criminal, and your dog might pursue your cat around the house just for fun.

Another kind of sleeve is a container or protective covering, like a record sleeve or a sleeve of crackers. If you have something ""up your sleeve,"" it means you're hiding something to use later in a surprising way.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B02_U30_1197,"<ul><li>A stain is a mark or discoloration, and to stain something is to mark it with dirt or color it, either deliberately or accidentally. If you stain your sister's favorite sweatshirt, she might be mad at you—especially if you didn't ask before borrowing it.</li><li>You can stain your favorite white pants when you're eating strawberries, or stain the table top you're making by painting it with a tinted liquid. The resulting stain in both cases is visible. Another kind of stain is a figurative mark or blemish, like the stain on your school records from that difficult semester when you never did your homework. Stain comes, via the Middle English disteynen, or ""discolor,"" from the Latin tingere, ""to color or dye.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U30_1198,"<ul><li>The verb strip has many shades of meaning, but most of them involve removing something. Someone may strip you of your power or you may strip off your clothes. Whatever it is that you strip, it’s gone.</li><li>When you strip something, you leave it bare. Strip can refer to removing a covering — like your clothes or like when you strip your sheets from your bed. Robbers may strip your car of all valuable items. And you might need to strip off a coat of paint before you start painting the front door. When used as a noun, strip could be something in a long, narrow shape — like an airstrip or a strip of material.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U30_1199,"<ul><li>When you take an oath about something, you swear to it, affirming its truth. Ironically, if you utter an oath, such as a curse word or obscenity, you also swear.  Do you swear to put a quarter in this jar for every time you swear?</li><li>The two separate meanings of swear come from branches of the same etymological tree. Both meanings have ties to Old Norse sverja, but sometime in the Middle English, the word became on one hand sweren with the meaning ""to promise,"" while another version, swerian, became ""to curse."" Both might come from the idea of an oath being connected to a deity, but while one referred to truth, the other went to the dark side, negatively invoking a sacred name.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B02_U30_1200,"<ul><li>To swing is to sway back and forth, or to move in a sweeping, curving motion. Wind chimes swing in the breeze, and a softball player swings her bat, aiming for the ball.</li><li>A TV hypnotist will swing a shiny object in front of a patient's face and say, ""You are getting very sleepy."" Kids on a playground will happily swing on swings for hours. And if you hear a sudden scary noise behind you, you might swing around in alarm or even take a swing, or a punch, in its direction. Since 1933, the noun swing has also meant a type of big-band jazz music.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1201,"<ul><li>An acre is a unit for measuring area, especially larger areas like farms. An acre is 4840 square yards.</li><li>It's pretty easy to imagine a square yard: three feet by three feet. Now imagine 4840 of them and you've got an acre. That's a pretty large chunk of land, and acres are used for measuring big areas in some English-speaking countries. Large areas such as farms, forests, and golf courses are likely to be measured in acres. Farms in particular need many acres to grow crops and give the animals space to live.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1202,"<ul><li>Afterlife is a noun describing the state of being after one’s death. Many cultures and religions have a concept of an afterlife.  Otherwise, much of humanity would be quite uneasy.</li><li>In Eastern religions, there is a notion of “karma” or even of “nirvana,” where, after a person dies, reincarnation takes the soul to a more elevated form of life.  The Judeo-Christian tradition trusts in “heaven”; the ancient Egyptians buried precious belongings with their dead to accompany them to the afterlife. Regardless of origin, most religions want people to believe that life doesn't stop when your pulse does.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1203,"<ul><li>If your idea of excitement is sifting dirt to find bits of pottery, chances are that you're an archaeology enthusiast. Archaeology is all about understanding the past by analyzing material culture — that is, objects shaped by human hands.</li><li>The Greek suffix  -ology (""the study of"") should be familiar. Consider the word biology: bios is Greek for ""life,"" so biology is ""the study of life."" Arkhaios is ""ancient."" Thus, archaeology is ""the study of ancient things."" Early archaeologists tended to seek  sensational finds — like Howard Carter, who found King Tut's tomb. Contemporary archaeologists are generally more concerned with reconstructing the lives of everyday people through careful analysis of mundane artifacts — like tools and feeding utensils.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1204,"<ul><li>A chamber is an enclosed space, often where a specific event usually takes place — such as a sleeping chamber or a torture chamber.</li><li>The history of the word chamber is an interesting one. The Latin word for room was camera. The original word for camera was camera obscura, or ""dark chamber,"" since it was a big black box. Now, the word chamber can refer to any enclosed space — such as the chamber of a gun or the four chambers of your heart.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1205,"<ul><li>A channel is a passageway, a means of access for a thing, a communication, or an idea.</li><li>Think of a channel as sort of a tunnel or a funnel that moves something directly through. The noun channel can be used for many such avenues. It can mean a waterway such as the English Channel — the ""Chunnel"" is a tunnel beneath the Channel — or a means of accomplishing a goal, as in ""going through legal channels."" Use it as a verb when you channel your energies to achieve success.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1206,"<ul><li>If you're looking for the most essential part or the very center of something, you're looking for its core. Like the inedible middle of an apple or your inner circle of core friends.</li><li>In the late 14th century, the noun core came about from the Old French coeur, meaning “core of fruit” and more literally, “heart.” So the core of something is its very heart, whether you're talking about the seed-containing center of a fruit, the central meaning of a book, or the core courses you need to take in order to graduate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1207,"<ul><li>A long hallway, especially one that has rooms opening up into it, is called a corridor. Late at night, hotel corridors all look alike. Be sure you try to open the right door with your key card.</li><li>A corridor is also a tract of land that connects two places or runs along the side of a road. In your town, the business corridor might be a fairly small strip of land with just a couple of restaurants and a few stores. The Northeast Corridor is the built-up area that links eastern cities in a chain that stretches from Boston to Washington, D.C.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1208,"<ul><li>When something is distinct, it is easily identifiable or set apart from others of its kind.  An eighth-grader who is six feet tall has a distinct advantage over the other kids on the basketball court.</li><li>A thing can be distinct if it is easy to see, either because it is different in some way from the things around it or if it is more clear and visible, as in: “The license number of the getaway car was more distinct once I cleaned my glasses.”  The word distinct comes from “to distinguish,” which is when a person or thing is set apart from the pack: “The research that she did was distinct in its attention to detail.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1209,"<ul><li>The elite are the group thought to be the best and having the highest status. In the middle ages, only elite men were taught to read and write.</li><li>There are elite schools, elite teams, and elite players, some really the best and some just calling themselves the best. Who can join the basketball elite besides LeBron James and Michael Jordan? That's a matter of opinion. Elite is used with a singular or plural verb, depending on whether these special people are considered together as a group or as individual members of a group.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1210,"<ul><li>An engineer is someone who possesses the knowledge or expertise to create and implement plans or build machines.  Even if you're not an engineer, when you engineer you make plans and solve problems.</li><li>An interesting part of the word engineer is the suffix -eer, which turns a word into one that means someone who does something indicated by the base it is affixed to — a mountaineer climbs mountains, an auctioneer presides at auctions, an engineer designs, coming from the Old French engin, which means ""skill or cleverness.""  If you want to become an engineer, you'll have to study all kinds of mechanical systems, not just engines.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1211,"<ul><li>To found something is like laying a ""foundation"" for a building — note the similarity?  But instead of a building, you might found a business or a charity, where you establish the groundwork upon which it can grow.</li><li>The verb found goes back to the Latin word fundus, meaning ""bottom,"" which in turn led to fundāre, meaning ""to lay the bottom of something.""   If you were to found a library, they might build a statue of you near the entrance.  If you're having trouble finding the library, look for a statue with a familiar face.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1212,"<ul><li>A gap is the space between two things. It can be physical (like ""the gap between your two front teeth"") or philosophical (like ""the generation gap"" between you and your parents).</li><li>Gap is a small word that packs a lot; it can be used in a straightforward manner: in England, the signs in the subway station say, ""Mind the gap"" — in hopes that passengers will not wander into the space between the train and the platform. The American retailer, ""The Gap,"" is said to have taken its name from the generation gap. The clothes were designed for teenagers and young adults, and therefore nothing your middle-aged parents would be caught dead in. Times change.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1213,"<ul><li>Glory is brilliant, radiant beauty. You might admire a princess in all her glory, since she seems almost too gorgeous to be real.</li><li>Glory is also a term that is sometimes used in a religious way. It means the glow or light that appears around the head of a holy person or saint, like a halo. Another use of glory is a state of high honor gained from great achievements. If you have heard the expression ""you're in your glory,"" it means that you are very happy and proud — you must have reached one of your big goals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1214,"<ul><li>Interior commonly refers to the inside of something. When house hunting you might find that the outside of the house is run down, but the interior rooms beautifully renovated.</li><li>If you design the color scheme of a room and pick our furnishings for it, you are an interior designer. If you delve into a characters feelings and emotions, you might describe what you're looking at as their interior. A place that lies far inland from a coast or border is said to lie in the interior of a country. If you talk to yourself inside your mind, you are said to be having an interior monologue.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1215,"<ul><li>A lion is a distant relative of your adorable pet kitten: a large, wild cat found in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Male lions have thick, golden-colored manes around their necks.</li><li>While the male lion is arguably more striking than the female, it's the females who do nearly all the hunting for a group, or pride, of lions. Tigers are actually larger than lions, making ""the king of the beasts"" the second-largest wild cat. Because of their strength and power, images of lions are often used as symbols on flags and coats of arms. It's also common to call a strong, courageous person a lion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1216,"<ul><li>A role is a part you play. In school, you might take on the role of clown, in your family, the role of the responsible one, on stage, the role of Juliet.</li><li>Role can also mean job or function. It is the role of the police to keep the community safe, and  political parties often argue about the role government should play in our lives. Roles can also be played by things. You can say that computers play an increasing role in our day-to-day lives and that the role of a hat is to keep your head warm. You look up to your role model because of the important role that they play in influencing others' lives.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1217,"<ul><li>Your highness! Anything royal has to do with a king or queen. The official announcement a queen makes is a royal declaration. Unofficially, royal can mean fit for a king or queen, like a royal welcome with cake and balloons.</li><li>Queen Elizabeth's corgis could be called the royal dogs, and the people who work at Buckingham Palace are the royal staff. Queen Elizabeth herself is royal — when royal describes a person it means someone who's a queen or king or belongs to a monarch's family. You can also use it sarcastically by saying someone’s a royal pain. No royalty necessary.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1218,"<ul><li>Sole means not shared with others. If it's your sole responsibility to make the chocolate cake for a party, it's all on you.</li><li>Sole comes from the Latin solus, meaning ""alone,"" and it can describe being the only person involved in something, like being the sole member of the Special People Club. As a noun, your sole is the bottom of your foot. If you order sole in a restaurant, you'll get a flat fish that looks like the bottom of your shoe. Although they sound alike, if you order the soul, the waitperson might send you to a church down the street.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U01_1219,
4000EEW_B03_U01_1220,"<ul><li>The surface is the outside of anything. The earth, a basketball, and even your body have a surface.</li><li>A surface is the top layer of something. The surface of the moon is rocky, with a lot of craters, while the surface of the earth has a lot of water. Sandpaper has a rough surface; a balloon has a smooth but rubbery surface. When we use the word surface, it usually means there is a lot of stuff underneath. That applies to our use of surface to mean outward mood, as in ""You look happy on the surface, but I know you're angry on the inside.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1221,"<ul><li>An agreement is made when two parties agree to something. So, for example, a mother might make an agreement with her son not to kiss him in public because, after kindergarten, well, that's just not cool.</li><li>If people's opinions are in accord, or match one another, then they are in agreement. If a teacher assigns a ten-page paper due the next day, the students would be in agreement that the assignment was unfair. A written or verbal contract can also be called an agreement. An agreement to deliver an article a month for a publication could not be broken simply because you have writer's block.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1222,"<ul><li>Arise is a verb that means to get up, maybe to stand or get out of bed, like when you arise in the morning to get ready for the day.</li><li>The verb arise can apply to people when they get up but it can also apply to issues or situations that come up, like problems that arise when a leader takes away people's rights. What happens next? People might arise, meaning they rebel, protesting the leader's actions, maybe even declaring that they are no longer under his or her rule. If this happens, a new political party will likely arise, meaning ""come into existence.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1223,"<ul><li>Every school, museum, and struggling artist is in search for a generous benefactor, or someone to provide the financial means to keep everything running smoothly.</li><li>The Latin roots of benefactor are bene, which means ""well,"" and facere, which means ""to do"" — literally, ""to do well.""  A benefactor does well by supporting (usually financially) a person or a good cause. In the old days, a struggling artist or actor might have been supported by a wealthy benefactor. Now, many struggling artists and actors have to rely on waiting tables and other odd jobs instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1224,"<ul><li>A blacksmith is someone who makes tools and other objects out of metal. Working as a blacksmith involves heating metal then bending and hammering it into the desired shape.</li><li>Blacksmiths mainly work with iron and steel, heating it until it's soft enough to bend, fold, and shape using tools. A blacksmith can make things like wrought iron fences and gates, knives and other cooking utensils, and metal light fixtures. While today many metal items once made by blacksmiths are mass produced in factories, there's a renewed interest in learning to make metal objects by hand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1225,"<ul><li>A chimney is the long, vertical, tunnel-like opening above a fireplace that provides a safe pathway for smoke — and the occasional Santa. It is also the name of the curvy glass flue in a hurricane lamp.</li><li>Ever since the use of fire indoors, it has been important to build a chimney to allow the smoke to escape. The word chimney comes ultimately from the Greek kaminos, ""furnace,"" and in 13th-century Old French it became the more familiar looking cheminee, ""fire place."" As chimney fires became a serious problem, the chimney sweep became an important person, cleaning the soot from chimneys. Oh, and dancing on the rooftops. (Or not.)</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1226,"<ul><li>Compensate is about correcting for an imbalance. If you step in an unmarked pothole, the city may compensate you by paying your doctor bills treating a broken ankle.</li><li>Compensate can also mean ""to adjust for."" So, if you did stumble into the pothole and injure your left leg, then you might compensate by leaning heavily on your right leg. Increasingly, compensate is used in place of pay. Day laborers are paid for their time, but executives are more likely to be compensated with a suite that includes salary and other benefits––what is commonly referred to as a compensation package.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1227,"<ul><li>If you run into that cute guy (or girl) from the local deli when you’re at the grocery store and you stop to chat, you’ve just had an encounter, which is a casual meeting, often resulting by chance.</li><li>When you encounter the word encounter, context will tell you if it’s acting as a verb or a noun. The sentence “When Spencer and Susanna encounter a bear on the trail, they stand very still” illustrates the verb form. “The encounter in the subway left her wishing she had stayed at home” shows the noun form. Whether acting as a verb or a noun, the word carries the connotation of “chance meeting."" You don’t plan an encounter; it just happens.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1228,"<ul><li>To exceed is to go beyond expectations, or to go too far. If you exceed the speed limit, you might get a speeding ticket.</li><li>Exceed and excess share the Latin root excedere meaning to ""go beyond.""  An excess is too much of something, like the piles of candy after Halloween, and exceed means the action of going too far in a good or bad way. You exceed in school when you get straight A's. When Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde, he experiences ""a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death."" No thanks! It helps to remember that like speed, exceed ends with -eed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1229,"<ul><li>Have you ever seen a blacksmith make a horseshoe? Well, no, probably not, but they use a special furnace which is called a forge, and ""to forge something"" is also the act of bashing that hot object into shape.</li><li>Forge has also taken on the more general sense of creating something. A new philosophy or art form might have been forged, as might an alibi or an excuse. To forge something also has the meaning of faking something, such as a painting or a signature with the intent to deceive. It can also mean to move ahead in a steady manner, either physically or metaphorically, much like those solid, regular blows of the blacksmith's hammer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1230,"<ul><li>Humble means ""modest; without an excess of pride."" A person who brags about being humble may have too much pride in being humble to actually be humble.</li><li>Sometimes fictional characters try to earn favor by saying ""I'm just a humble man in search of..."" when it is obvious they are the opposite. Truly humble people keep quiet about their accomplishments and the good things they do. Humble can also mean ""low in station or quality."" If you come from a humble background, you didn't grow up wealthy, and if you live in a humble apartment, it isn't overly grand or showy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1231,"<ul><li>Iron can refer to a common metal. It can also be that thing you use to get wrinkles out of your clothing. If you’re planning to wear linen, you might need an iron to smooth it out.</li><li>When you use an iron to iron your clothes, you’re also using both the noun and verb form of iron. The noun describes the appliance and the verb describes the action of using it. Iron can also refer to a golf club, like that 5-iron you always use. If you’ve ever been a cattle rancher, you might also be familiar with a branding iron, a tool used to brand skin with a mark of ownership.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1232,"<ul><li>If your ball lands on the roof, grab a ladder and climb up and get it. A ladder has steps you use to reach up high. If you climb the corporate ladder, you’re moving up in the business world.</li><li>Some ladders are just a few feet tall, and others are taller than a house. Still others are invisible –- any time you move up in your career as a banker or NFL football player, you climb the ladder. In British English, a ladder is a run in stockings, which is funny because it usually looks like one. The superstition that it's bad luck to walk under an open ladder dates from the eighteenth century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1233,"<ul><li>A person is modest if he or she is very successful but does not call attention to this.</li><li>Modest generally means ""big enough but not huge"" — like a modest house or a modest income. An ambitious person will not be satisfied with modest progress. Around the turn of the 17th century, modest referred to proper or decent dress and behavior especially in women. Although this is considered dated today, modest is still used for people who are shy about showing their body. If you are modest, you might wear your t-shirt when you swim.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1234,"<ul><li>When you spend a lot of your free time reading tea leaves, you occupy yourself with that pastime, meaning it takes up your time and keeps you busy.</li><li>An army can invade another country and occupy its territory, and this use of the word reflects its original Latin meaning, which was ""to seize."" There are also less aggressive forms of occupation, as with the family of chipmunks who occupy your garden.  If you are the mayor of your town, you occupy an important office. And if you're a fan of Andy Warhol, a series of Campbell's soup can paintings may occupy a prominent place on your walls.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1235,"<ul><li>It takes a hundred pennies to make a dollar. Even though it doesn't have a heck of a lot of value, a penny may bring you luck if you pick it up (as the saying goes).</li><li>In the US, a penny is a one-cent, copper-colored coin, which features Abraham Lincoln's profile on one side. Many countries' currencies include pennies as the very smallest unit of money, including Canada, Britain, and South Africa. While the plural form of penny is pence in the UK, and it's often abbreviated as p there, in North America the plural is commonly pennies — and sometimes cents.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1236,"<ul><li>To preach is to deliver a sermon or an otherwise powerful message. You may go to church to hear the minister preach, and you may preach tolerance to your friends.</li><li>Have you ever heard anyone say, ""That's preaching to the choir""? That means you're wasting your words on somebody who already believes what you believe. If you're giving an impassioned speech about recycling to an audience dressed in reclaimed clothing and sandals made of old tires, you're likely to be preaching to the choir. The word preach comes from the Latin prae, ""before,"" and dicare, ""declare."" When you preach, you're not just talking — you're declaring something with conviction.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1237,"<ul><li>As any fan of Star Trek knows, “live long and prosper” is good advice. The verb prosper means to do well, succeed, or thrive.</li><li>The verb prosper commonly means to generate wealth, as in “she hopes to prosper from her new investments.” But more generally it means “grow stronger” or ""flourish"" — crops will prosper when they have adequate sun and water, and rescued animals can prosper in a loving home. You can also prosper from good advice or a wise decision: for example, “cheaters never prosper” is one piece of advice that might help you prosper.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1238,"<ul><li>A province is a region within a country. If  you travel to Canada, you'll have to decide whether you want to go to the province of Quebec, or Saskatchewan, or one of the other 8 provinces in that enormous country.</li><li>Many countries are divided into provinces. In the U.S. we don't have official provinces; we have states and counties. But we can use province in its other meaning, which is ""the sphere of one's activities."" If you manage a coffee shop and sit there reading and drinking coffee even when you're not working, then that shop is your province.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1239,"<ul><li>Satisfaction is the act of fulfilling a need, desire, or appetite, or the feeling gained from such fulfillment.</li><li>Satisfaction means you’ve had enough — in a good way. When a product says ""Satisfaction guaranteed"" it means you’ll like it or they'll give you your money back. A good meal provides satisfaction of your hunger. When you graduate from school or get a good job, you have a feeling of satisfaction. This term once meant an act of atonement assigned by a priest to make up for a sin. When something is explained well, it was explained to your satisfaction.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U02_1240,"<ul><li>Sustain means to support something or keep it going. If you get hungry in the mid-afternoon, you might try snacking to sustain your energy through dinner.</li><li>Beams and rafters sustain a roof — they keep it up. If you sustain a conversation over the course of hours, you keep it going during that time. If you sustain an injury, it means you are injured. If you sustain an interest in what you're studying, it means that you're just as excited about the subject after studying as you are when you began.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1241,"<ul><li>To acquire means to get or come to own something. You acquire an education by your own effort. You acquire a painting by paying for it or by someone giving it to you. You acquire a sense of calm in crisis through experience.</li><li>The list of things you can acquire includes: an object, a trait, a skill, or an ability. An acquired taste is something that people usually don't like when they first experience it, but later they come to enjoy it, such as raw clams or marmite. The verb acquire was borrowed from Latin acquīrere ""to add to,"" from the prefix ad- ""at, toward"" plus quaerere ""to seek, get.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1242,"<ul><li>If you are awkward, chances are you are uncomfortable. You could feel socially awkward, like when you forget the host's name. Or, you may feel physically awkward, like when you trip on your way to the podium.</li><li>Have you ever felt clumsy and that you had two left feet? That is how it is to feel awkward — literally that you are going in the wrong direction. Awkward is an example of a word literally meaning something and then figuratively meaning something related. Its Middle English roots are awke, meaning ""backhanded,"" and -ward, to ""go in the direction of."" So, if you are feeling uncomfortable, or clumsy, it's probably because your hands are connected to you the wrong way!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1243,"<ul><li>When you work as a caretaker, you look after a house or a piece of property. The caretaker of a grand old estate might live in a small cottage on its grounds.</li><li>A caretaker might make small repairs to a house, weed a property's flower gardens, or mow the lawn. Some caretakers live in the house they care for, often during an off season when its main inhabitants don't stay there. You can also use the word to mean ""caregiver,"" a person who takes care of someone who's elderly or ill, or to refer to someone who looks after animals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1244,"<ul><li>To deceive means to trick or lie. A crafty kid might deceive his mother into thinking he has a fever by holding the thermometer to a light bulb to increase the temperature.</li><li>Deceive is the trickier cousin of lie. You might lie about why you were late to school. But if you simply don't explain to your mom that you were late in the first place, you are deceiving her. Deceive carries with it a feeling of both craftiness and betrayal. When you deceive someone, forgiveness can be hard to come by.

The verb discourage has roots in the French word descouragier, which comes from des-, meaning “away,” and corage, or “courage.” So when you discourage someone, you can think of it as taking his courage — or enthusiasm — away.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1246,"<ul><li>You should have known that copy of the ""Declaration of Independence"" was a fake when you saw it was signed by ""Jon Hancrock"" instead of ""John Hancock."" Something that's fake isn't authentic.</li><li>A person who falsely claims to be, feel, or do something can be said to be fake. When your friend acts sweet but spreads rumors about you behind your back, you can call her a fake. As a verb, fake means to take an action with the intent to deceive. If you've ever tried to fake a grade on your report card, you know that it's especially hard to change an F to an A.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1247,"<ul><li>The noun hatred means to feel a strong emotional dislike toward something or someone. You feel hatred of people who have done terrible things to you, or books about too-perfect teens.</li><li>Hatred comes from Old English hete, which means ""hate,"" plus the suffix red (ræden), which means ""the condition of."" If you find after twenty years of marriage you no longer like your husband, you may be able to work it out. If you feel hatred towards him, your differences may be irreconcilable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1248,"<ul><li>If you've ever camped under a wooden lean-to, you know what a hut is — it's a simple, usually temporary shelter that doesn't do much more than keep the rain off your head.</li><li>A hut can be built from many different materials, including wood, stone, snow, or even cardboard. What all huts have in common is a simple design and the intention that it provide a short-term shelter from the weather. Campers, hikers, and skiers often rest or sleep in huts. The word comes from the French hutte, ""cottage,"" which has its root in the Old English word for ""to hide,"" hydan. Hut was originally used in English to describe military dwellings.</li></ul>"

The word inferior can also be used as a noun to mean ""a person who is lower in rank or status,"" in which case you might say to your younger brother, ""You are my inferior, therefore you should take out the trash.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1250,"<ul><li>A lodge is an inn where travelers stay overnight. If you’re in need of a night’s sleep while traveling an out of the way country road, you’re more likely to find yourself at a lodge than a fancy or chain hotel.</li><li>A lodge can also be a cabin in the woods; like an inn, it’s usually a temporary accommodation. But if you join your local lodge, you’ll be expected to be a regular visitor, at least at the monthly meetings. Lodge is also a verb, meaning to stay temporarily, or to give someone a place to stay. If you lodge a toothpick between your teeth, though, you’ll probably hope it won’t stay there too long.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1251,"<ul><li>Neglect is worse than ignoring something. It's ignoring it, failing to care for it, and probably harming it in the process.</li><li>The word neglect comes from the Latin verb neglegere, which means ""disregarded."" You can neglect to do your chores, meaning fail to do them, but this word is usually reserved for cases when you willingly refuse to care for something appropriately. Child neglect is what parents get charged with when they fail to provide for their child's basic needs. If you go on vacation and neglect your plants, they may wither and die due to your lack of attention.</li></ul>"

There are a lot of great words that have the same meaning as newcomer, like neophyte, rookie, and Johnny-come-lately. One popular slang term for newcomer is newbie, which is often shortened on the Internet to noob.</li></ul>"

If you play forward on a soccer team, you are on offense.</li><li>If you offend someone — that is you cause them to be upset because of your actions or words — then you may need to apologize for the offense. After all, you meant no offense when you said that disco was dead. How were you to know the guy still loved the '70s? In the eyes of the law, an offense is a crime.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1254,"<ul><li>To overlook something is to fail to see it. When planning a party, it's best to write out a to-do list so that you don't overlook any details.</li><li>The verb overlook literally means to look over the top of. The word has come to refer to the act of neglecting something, usually because your focus is aimed elsewhere. You might overlook the cost of car insurance if you’re busy calculating the cost of buying the car and paying for gas and parking. As a noun, an overlook is a space high above ground. You might overlook your curfew if you're busy enjoying an overlook with your date.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1255,"<ul><li>When you give someone money that you owe them, you repay them. A bank may loan you money to buy a new car, but you'll have to repay the money, plus interest.</li><li>You might repay a bank loan, or repay your brother the dollar you borrowed last week. You can also repay things other than money: ""How will I ever repay your kindness and support?"" Repay comes from the French repaier, with its ""back"" prefix re- and payer, ""to pay.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1256,"<ul><li>Did you just say that you could toss a rubber chicken over an ocean? Don’t be ridiculous, because ridiculous words are hard to believe, and they will make others laugh at you, not always in a good way either.</li><li>The adjective ridiculous comes from the Latin word ridere, which means “to laugh,” but it’s also related to the word ridicule, which means to mock in a cruel way. A mocking and cruel laughter, that’s a common reaction to ridiculous situations. However, there are all different kinds of ridiculous, like seeing a fish holding an umbrella while riding a bike.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1257,"<ul><li>If something's satisfactory it's okay — acceptable, but maybe not great. When you take a course pass/fail, your grade will be satisfactory if you meet all the requirements and do a reasonable job, or unsatisfactory if you don't.</li><li>Try not to confuse satisfactory and satisfying. If you've cooked a satisfactory turkey for Thanksgiving, your guests aren't getting sick or making excuses to leave the table, but they're probably not asking for seconds either. But if your turkey is satisfying, everybody is complimenting you on your culinary skills and probably sitting back in their chairs with contented smiles on their faces.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1258,"<ul><li>A shepherd is a person who herds flocks or groups of animals. If you traveled to Tibet, you might see a yak shepherd.</li><li>Shepherd comes from the Old English sceaphierde: sheepherder. Such a person protects sheep from animals that would attack them, keeps them from wandering, and otherwise takes care of the flock. The word is also a verb that describes care of a group — sheep, other animals, even people. You might shepherd your herd of goats, or shepherd your younger siblings through the transition from elementary to middle school.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1259,"<ul><li>A venture is a risky undertaking. If your latest venture is a dog food store, you hope there are some hungry dogs around. Also, to venture is to go somewhere possibly dangerous, like if you venture out into a snowstorm.</li><li>Venture is a shortened form of adventure. This happened sometime between 1100 CE and 1400 CE during the time that Middle English was spoken. While the two words are similar in meaning, when you subtract the ad, you lose a teaspoon or two of fun, and add a heaping tablespoon of risk.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U03_1260,"<ul><li>Wheat is the grain most commonly used in things like bread, pasta, and cake. When wheat is ground, it becomes flour you can use for baking. Who wants cupcakes?</li><li>A field of wheat looks like tall, green grasses — the wheat turns golden-colored when it's ready to be harvested. More farmland is planted with wheat than any other crop, as it's a major worldwide source of carbohydrates. Some people are sensitive or allergic to the gluten in wheat, but most of us can safely eat and enjoy the many foods made from wheat. The Germanic source means ""that which is white,"" from a root meaning ""to shine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1261,"<ul><li>An alley is a narrow street with walls or buildings on both sides, like the dark alley everyone warns you not to walk down alone.</li><li>Alley comes from the Old French word alee, meaning ""a path, passage, way, corridor,"" which itself likely comes from the Latin word ambulare ""to walk."" That sums up what an alley is — a street that is usually too narrow for cars, though it is easy to walk there. However, alleys are often associated with danger and crime because they don't have much light shining in them, and it is easy for shady characters to hide.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1262,"<ul><li>An ax is a sharp tool for cutting wood. When you split logs, you hold the handle, swing the ax into the air, and let the blade fall on the wood.</li><li>Most axes have a long wooden handle connected to a blade made of sharpened steel. An ax is a useful tool to own if you have a wood stove or are building a campfire. You can also spell the word with an e at the end: axe. As a verb, to ax means to fire someone from a job: ""He was late so many times that I finally had to ax him.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1263,"<ul><li>A group or cluster of something is a bunch. It could be a bunch of people or a bunch of grapes. If you pick a bunch of bananas, you might end up being followed by a bunch of monkeys.</li><li>When you use the word bunch, you're generally talking about an approximate number of similar items, like a bunch of flowers or a bunch of cats or a bunch of your friends meeting for dinner. The verb bunch means ""gather together,"" or ""form into a bunch,"" the way you might bunch daisies together in a vase, or your socks might bunch down inside your boots.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1264,"<ul><li>A chore is a duty or task you’re obligated to perform, often one that is unpleasant but necessary. Washing the dishes is a chore, and so is completing a homework assignment you aren’t excited about.</li><li>Sometimes a thing that you wanted to do can become a chore if it ceases to be fun or interesting. Maybe Napoleon felt that conquering nations had become a chore by the time he was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo. The noun chore dates from the 18th century, when there were fewer appliances and more household tasks that needed to be done.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1265,"<ul><li>The adjective decent means sufficient or acceptable. The local diner you like to frequent may not serve a four-star breakfast, but it probably has decent food.</li><li>Though the concept is a little dated, people of ""decent society"" are socially correct. They don't break the law, behave rudely, use impolite language, or wear inappropriate clothing. Decent can also mean ""nice"": Holding the door for a woman with a stroller is the decent thing to do. Lastly, decent can also mean ""appropriately clothed"" (or just ""not naked""). If a stranger is knocking on your door, you're probably not going to answer it until you're decent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1266,"<ul><li>Anything disgraceful is shameful or shocking. No matter how angry you are at your younger sister, it would be disgraceful to destroy the Lego creation she painstakingly built.</li><li>The adjective disgraceful is good for describing completely unacceptable behavior — if you do something disgraceful, you should feel ashamed about it. The internment of Americans of Japanese descent during World War II was a disgraceful episode in U.S. history. The word comes from the verb disgrace, ""bring shame or reproach upon"" or ""a loss of grace.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1267,"<ul><li>Your elbow is the bendy part of your arm between your wrist and your shoulder. Sometimes people use their pointy elbows to elbow people out of the way.</li><li>Your elbows are major joints in your arms, making it possible for you to do many things — including get scolded for having your elbows rudely on the table while you eat. Clothing can be said to have elbows as well: ""I like your professor jacket with the patches on the elbows."" Other inanimate objects with elbows include rivers and pipes: a sharp bend in either of these is also called an elbow.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1268,"<ul><li>A person who is grateful feels or shows gratitude. If your neighbor brings you soup when you're sick, you'll be very grateful (unless you hate soup).</li><li>Grateful comes from gratus, Latin for pleasing.  Originally it meant pleasing, or agreeable (Walter Scott wrote of ""the grateful and cooling shade""), but now means thankful. Usually you are grateful to someone for a particular thing she's done. If you're complaining about all your problems, someone might remind you of what you have to be grateful for.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1269,"<ul><li>To irritate is to cause an unsettling reaction, whether it's of the body or the nerves. You can irritate someone by talking too loudly on your cellphone in public. You can also irritate your skin, causing a rash or redness.</li><li>To irritate is to disturb — either physically or psychologically. When you have an allergic reaction to something, you irritate or disturb the body. When you have an allergic reaction to your kid brother, he is probably irritating you with his annoying habits. And what is the result of something irritating? An irritation of course.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1270,"<ul><li>If a farmer offers to introduce you to her kid, you might not know if she means her child or her baby goat.</li><li>A kid is a child, informally, and it's also a young goat. Sometimes the word kid means a kind of soft leather made from goat skin. When kid is used as a verb, it means to tease or jokingly deceive someone — to kid them. Some sticklers for formality object to using kid to mean ""child,"" but that meaning has been around since the 1590s. The ""teasing"" definition of kid comes from the sense of ""treat like a child.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1271,"<ul><li>If something is loose, it's not attached very securely to anything. Be sure the horse trailer attached to your truck isn't loose, or it might just roll away on its own while you're on the highway.</li><li>Loose means ""not fixed."" We can use it for things that you physically attach, like doorknobs or buttons, or for ideas that aren't rigid. If someone has loose morals, they don't have a strong moral code. A floppy dancer has loose limbs, and a loose ball is one that no one's holding. It's also a verb. To loose something is to set it free, which is different from losing it. You loose the wild squirrel you nursed back to health.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1272,"<ul><li>If you hurt someone's feelings, you offend that person. You might accidentally offend your friend when you joke about the worst restaurant in town, not realizing it's her favorite place to eat.</li><li>If you do something that makes another person resent you, you offend them. Your friends might not mind because you're so humble, but it could offend other classmates when the teachers always pick you for awards and honors. You also offend when you cause disgust or distaste. After your week of camping — and not showering — your smell will probably offend the nose of anyone who has to sit near you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1273,"<ul><li>When something happens overnight, it occurs during the hours of one night. An overnight party can also be called a sleepover or a slumber party. (Pack your sleeping bag, but you probably won't use it.)</li><li>You can use overnight as an adverb or adjective literally meaning ""during the night"" — like an overnight airplane flight or a guest who stays overnight on your couch. You can also use it figuratively, to mean ""quickly"" or ""instant."" After you publish your first book, you may be an overnight success; and after an important election, the world may seem to change overnight.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1274,"<ul><li>When someone persists they keep going or hang on. If you want to finish a marathon, you have to persist and keep running, no matter how many blisters you have.</li><li>The great Roman poet Ovid once advised: “Endure and persist, this pain will turn good by and by.” As Ovid’s quote hints at, persistence is often associated with hardship and the reward that comes with not backing down. Synonyms include endure, follow through, and persevere, while antonyms include cease and give up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1275,"<ul><li>If you pine for someone, you desperately want to see them, be with them, or perhaps smother them with kisses. If you're texting your ex-boyfriend over 50 times a day, there's a pretty good chance that you still pine for him.</li><li>In Old English, pine meant ""to torture or cause to experience pain,"" which seems quite fitting if you've known what it's like to pine for something or someone. The verb pine should not be confused with the noun pine, as in the evergreen tree. If you are from the Northeast and find yourself living in the Caribbean, you may pine for the sight of a pine tree, but the lovely weather should ease the pain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1276,"<ul><li>A scar is a place where a wound healed but is still visible, or if you're little, it's a mark where a boo-boo was.</li><li>Scar is from the Greek word eskhara, a ""scab formed after a burn."" It's all that and more. Scar can be a noun or a verb — you can have a scar on your knee after your skateboarding incident, and a bad round of chicken pox can scar you. Something scary can scar, you, too, like a horror movie or catching your parents in the act. Scars can be emotional. Take one letter off scare and you're left with a scar.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1277,"<ul><li>A sensation is a type of feeling, picked up by one of the five senses. Peppercorns will give you the sensation of a million tiny pinpricks on your tongue.</li><li>A sensation is something from your senses. If you lose sensation in your feet, they are numb and it's time for you to get up and move around to restore blood flow. You can call something a sensation if it is wonderful and astonishing. Your parents will tell you that you were a sensation in the school play. Everyone will want to go see the special-effects movie that critics are calling a worldwide sensation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1278,"<ul><li>If you want to slide down a snowy hill, hop on a sled! A sled can be simple and plastic, or it can be more complicated, with wood and metal runners, like the kind that huskies pull across the tundra. Mush!</li><li>Sleds sit on runners made to glide over an icy or snowy surface. Large sleds can seat several riders and are pulled by one or more horses, while dog sleds pull one or two people and are usually pulled by several dogs. The sled you get out of the garage in the winter is made of plastic, wood, or metal, and it's meant to slide fast downhill. In the U.K., the word for a sled is sledge.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1279,"<ul><li>To tease is to pick on someone or to give false hope. You can tease your little sister by saying ""nanny nanny boo boo"" or by holding a cookie just out of her reach.</li><li>Tease, a modern spelling of the Old English taesan “pluck, pull apart"" is now associated with the act of harassing. You can still use tease as a verb, though, to describe the act of backcombing your hair to give it volume. But more commonly, tease refers to messing with someone. There’s an old proverb, “Patience when teased is often transformed into rage,” which means if you tease someone a lot, you might get your booty kicked!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U04_1280,"<ul><li>A valentine is a sweetheart: specifically, someone who receives a greeting or attention on Valentine's Day.</li><li>There are many words for someone you like in a romantic way, such as sweetie, main squeeze, boyfriend, girlfriend, significant other, and special someone. Another is valentine, though you'll mainly hear this word on Valentine's Day: February 14. Asking ""Will you be my valentine?"" is like asking ""Will you go out with me?"" and saying ""I like you."" Sending a card is a common way to let someone know you want to be their valentine.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1281,"<ul><li>When you acquaint yourself with something, you familiarize yourself with it. When you visit a new city, you should acquaint yourself with the layout of the streets so you don’t get lost.</li><li>You can also acquaint yourself with another person, by introducing yourself and getting know them. When you see the moving truck pull in across the street, you might want to run over and acquaint yourself with your new neighbors.  The word acquaint comes via French from the Latin accognoscere, which is made up of  ad- “to,” or “toward,” and cognoscere “come to know.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1282,"<ul><li>A cemetery is the land used for burials. If you are 11 and you purchase a plot in a cemetery, you are planning too far ahead.</li><li>Cemetery comes all the way from the Greek work koimētērion, which means ""sleeping place."" But the sleep you do in cemeteries is an eternal one. Cemeteries can often be found near churches, or in big parks outside of cities, usually gated off because the ground has been consecrated, or blessed. Sometimes we use cemetery metaphorically. The sea is a cemetery for shipwrecked sailors, just as a junk shop might be a cemetery for old shoes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1283,"<ul><li>A creature is a living thing: there are flying creatures, sea creatures, and even imaginary creatures, like unicorns.</li><li>Ever heard of a ""creature feature""? That's a horror movie about weird scary creatures and other monsters. But you can call pretty much any living thing a creature. You'll find all kinds of creatures at the zoo, and maybe even a few lurking in your smelly gym shoes. Bears, bugs, birds, and bunnies are all creatures. When you see the word creature, think ""It's alive!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1284,"<ul><li>When you curse, you say words you wouldn't want your mother or your priest to hear you saying. A curse can also be wishing something awful on someone, like the witch who puts a curse on Sleeping Beauty.</li><li>When you hear ""maledizione!"" in an Italian opera, somebody's having a curse placed on them. The Italian word tells you just what a curse is — it's a ""bad saying"" — a really bad saying. Like ""May you and all your family have nothing but Brussels sprouts to eat forever and ever!"" That would be a curse. As a verb, the act of cursing will lead to getting your mouth washed out with soap.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1285,"<ul><li>A disguise is something you put on so no one recognizes you. It also can be used as a verb. You can disguise yourself with a wig and mustache; that's a great disguise.</li><li>Disguise can be used anytime you're talking about concealing or hiding something. Most of the time we think of a disguise as something you wear, but you can also disguise your feelings. Criminals might disguise their intentions. You can also use the word to describe something that seems to be one thing, but turns out to be another. You missed the plane, but then the plane crashed. That's a blessing in disguise.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1286,"<ul><li>Fancy can be an adjective, noun, or a verb. As an adjective, it’s the opposite of plain. The noun names something that isn’t real. When someone likes or wants something, the verb can be used: “I fancy a cup of tea.” Doesn’t that sound fancy?</li><li>Fancy is an old contraction of the word fantasy. You’ll often see this word used in the phrase “flights of fancy.” This phrase refers to an unrealistic goal or idea such as, “He has flights of fancy about running off to Hollywood and becoming a movie star.” Fancy can also be used as an expression of affection. If you have a crush on someone, for instance, you could say that you “took a fancy” to him or her.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1287,"<ul><li>A flashlight is a light that's small enough to hold in your hand and carry around. When you're camping, it's useful to bring a flashlight so you can find your sleeping bag in the dark tent.</li><li>Most flashlights are powered with batteries, although some of them can be charged in the sun and use the stored solar energy for power. All flashlights are portable, basically small lamps that fit easily in your hand, your pocket, or your backpack. In Britain, a flashlight is often called a torch. The earliest versions of flashlights were invented around 1899.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1288,"<ul><li>A hood is a protective covering. It could be a car hood protecting the engine or your car or it could be the hood on your coat protecting your noggin.</li><li>Your favorite sweatshirt might have a hood, as well as your fur-lined winter coat and your insulated hood for scuba diving. Other things with a similar protective quality are also called hoods, like the metal vent cover over your stove, the cover on your car's engine, and the cap-like plant sections that cover vulnerable parts. One of the most famous hoods in literature is the red one worn by the main character in ""Little Red Riding Hood.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1289,"<ul><li>Someone who usually lives in a specific place — whether it's a mansion, a cave, or a beach house — is its inhabitant.</li><li>The old man who lives in the scary house down the street is its inhabitant, and the skunk that built a nest under your porch is — unfortunately — an inhabitant of your front yard. The noun inhabitant comes from the verb inhabit, or ""to live in,"" which in turn is rooted in the Latin word inhabitare, ""to dwell in or to live in.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1290,"<ul><li>When you nourish your imagination or your body, you give it what it needs to stay healthy and flourish (hey, that rhymes!).</li><li>Whenever you eat a nutritious meal, you nourish your body. You can also nourish your dreams by allowing yourself to take chances and try what interests you, even if you're not sure what the outcome will be. To transform the verb nourish into an adjective, you can just add ing. Then, you can describe things that nourish you — like protein shakes or good poetry — as nourishing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1291,"<ul><li>Yarg, matey! A cartoon pirate wears an eye patch, three-cornered hat, billowy shirt, and tall black boots. In real life, a pirate just boards ships and robs them of cargo, valuables, and money, often while wearing regular boring clothes.</li><li>Pirates have been around since humans have been shipping valuable goods by boat across oceans. You can also use pirate as a verb to describe what these robbers do. Today, in addition to traditional pirates, there are pirates who use digital creative material, like books, movies, games, and music, without paying for it. If you pirate a movie, you make a copy and sell it illegally. The Greek root of pirate is peirates, ""one who attacks.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1292,"<ul><li>A publication is something made to communicate with the public. Publications are usually printed on paper (like magazines and books), but online publications are delivered via the Internet.</li><li>The noun publication comes from the Latin word publicare, meaning “make public.” Publication usually means something is written and made available publicly, but a company or government can submit publications of things like earnings or unemployment indexes that are communicated differently. If you are an aspiring author, publication of your work is, most likely, the Holy Grail you seek.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1293,"<ul><li>What's a question or problem that requires a bit of thought before you answer? It's a riddle, of course. The verb riddle can mean to speak in a puzzling fashion, though that use is not very common.</li><li>The word riddle might put you in mind of such brain-teasers as ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"", but riddles actually have a distinguished history in English literature going back to the 10th century. Today, you often find riddle used to mean a hard problem or question to figure out. Is it a riddle to you why you have to go to school? In an unrelated use, if something is riddled with holes, there are many holes in it, quite possibly from bullets!</li></ul>"

When old food at the back of your refrigerator rots, you should throw it away.</li><li>Sometimes you can tell when something is beginning to rot because it smells bad. But the process that occurs when things rot is a natural one that you can see all around you as you walk through the woods or along the beach. Living organisms have to rot after they die, to make room for more organisms.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U05_1296,"<ul><li>One thing every person (and most animals) in the world has in common is a skeleton: we all have a connected group of bones that help shape and support our bodies.</li><li>You probably see a lot of skeletons at Halloween, because they look a little spooky. They shouldn't scare you too much, because we all have skeletons under our skin and muscles. Skeletons give our body shape, and parts of the skeleton (like the skull) protect important organs (like the brain). Sometimes, the word skeleton is used to mean the ""bare bones"" of other things: the skeleton of a financial plan is a basic outline of that plan. If you said someone has a ""skeleton in their closet,"" it means they're hiding something embarrassing or incriminating.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1297,"<ul><li>When you spoil something, you destroy it or ruin its quality. If you spoil a surprise, you tell the secret you were supposed to keep.</li><li>When you spoil something, you mess it up, like spoiling someone's good mood by bringing up a painful memory. Food can also spoil, or become unsafe for eating, and you can spoil a child by always giving him everything he wants, making him unable to cope when things don't go his way. The word spoil comes from the Old French espoillier, to plunder. In fact, things taken by force are called spoils, like the spoils of war.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1298,"<ul><li>The verb starve means suffering or death caused by a lack of food, though people also use it as a dramatic way to say they are hungry, as in, ""If we don't start cooking dinner now, I think I'll starve.""</li><li>The word starve has origins in the Old English word steorfan, meaning “to die.” It is true that if you don't eat for a period of time, you could starve, meaning die from hunger. Today, starve is also used to describe less severe limitations on food, such as when you tell your friend, ""I have to go to lunch now. I'm starving."" This is a way of describing discomfort caused by hunger.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1299,"<ul><li>Thrill doesn’t refer to any old type of excitement; this stuff is intense. For many people, the experience of riding a roller coaster provides a great thrill, or an intense feeling of excitement.</li><li>Thrill comes from an Old English word meaning “pierce,” suggesting the metaphor of being “pierced by emotion.” Thrill is often used in a strictly positive sense, though it can also refer to the unique combination of terror and pleasure that some people experience in certain situations — for example, when riding death-defying roller coasters or watching frightening flicks (often called thrillers).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U05_1300,"<ul><li>Wicked has two quite contradictory meanings. If something is pure evil, then it is wicked. Think Darth Vader. On the other hand, as an informal slang term, wicked also means excellent — as in ""that DJ is wicked, man!"" Go figure.</li><li>Other shades of meaning for wicked include something that is playful or enjoyably malicious. Someone might have a wicked sense of humor, for example, meaning it's fierce and takes aim sharply at its victims. Or it can also mean something that, while not actively evil, is still extremely unpleasant. Exams can be wicked, and so can someone's temper or the weather. The word comes from the Old English term wicca meaning ""wizard.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1301,"<ul><li>Alert! Alert! Alert! Did I get your attention? When you are alert, you are awake and ready. When you issue an alert you give warning, alerting people to, or notifying them of, a concern.</li><li>Alert is one of the rare words that can be used in the same form as a noun, verb, and adjective. In all parts of speech, alert implies preparedness. The word is derived from the French a l'erte which translates to ""on the watch."" When you hear the word, imagine an alarm going off. The alarm is the alert. When you hear it, you have been alerted and you are now alert.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1302,"<ul><li>To broadcast is to air a program, especially on TV or radio. It also means to tell people about something. If you paint your one true love’s name on your car, you broadcast your feelings to the whole world!</li><li>The word broadcast used to have to do with spreading seed, but now it refers to spreading information. It can be a noun or verb — if you turn on the radio, you're hearing a broadcast, and the station is broadcasting that show. You don’t have to be in a studio to broadcast, though. Any time you let a lot of people know about something (whether they like it or not), you broadcast. When information is broadcast, it becomes widely known.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1303,"<ul><li>A brief news report or statement that's written or spoken is a bulletin. A TV reporter might read a bulletin announcing the winner of a presidential election, for example.</li><li>You're most likely to hear a bulletin on the radio or television, usually in the form of a news update. A bulletin can also be a written or emailed report or newsletter that gives you brief information. A bulletin board is a message board that has such bulletins pinned to it. The root of bulletin is the Italian bulletta, ""document"" or ""voting slip.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1304,"<ul><li>A bump is an area that bulges out, like a pregnant woman's stomach. To bump someone is to knock into them.</li><li>A pimple is a little bump. A camel’s hump is a larger bump. There are speed bumps sticking up in the road to keep drivers from going too fast. When you bump someone, you hit them with your whole body. If the person in front of you stops walking and you're not paying attention, you might bump right into them. Bumping often happens by accident, unless of course you are doing ""the bump"" (a 1970's dance).</li></ul>"

In many places, there are farms where you can chop down your own Christmas tree.</li><li>When you chop wood, you usually hit it with an axe, splitting each length into narrow pieces. A chef uses a knife to chop, hacking an onion into tiny bits, for example. When it's a piece of meat that's cut so it's attached to a bone, such as part of a rib, it can be described as a chop — like a lamb chop. And if someone claps his hands at you and says, ""Chop-chop!"" he means ""Hurry up!""</li></ul>"

Or maybe you just hate changing diapers.</li><li>You usually try to console someone by providing encouragement and offering solace. Others try to console themselves with tubs of ice cream. From the Latin word consolari, meaning “to comfort,”  the noun console can also describe a central control panel. In an automobile, the controls for both the radio and air-conditioning are in the same center console.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1308,"<ul><li>Use the word district to talk about a specific part of your city or town. Your school district, for example, is an officially marked area that designates which school students can attend.</li><li>When a government outlines a region of a state, city, or town, that area is called a district. Besides school districts, there are also congressional districts and electoral districts, which are set up specifically for organizing voting and governing. In the 1600s, the word district was used for a feudal lord's territory, and it came from the Latin districtus, ""territory of jurisdiction,"" with its root of distringere, ""draw apart.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1309,"<ul><li>A drawer is a sliding compartment that fits into a dresser and is used for storage. You might keep socks in one drawer and t-shirts in another.</li><li>Dressers have drawers, and so do other pieces of furniture, including desks, bureaus, and kitchen cabinets. Your kitchen drawers might be full of silverware, while the drawers in your office are a jumble of pens, paper clips, and Post-It notes. Drawer comes from the verb draw, from its ""pull"" meaning — the original idea of the word was that it's a container that's ""drawn"" out of a cabinet.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1310,"<ul><li>If something endures, it lasts: Beethoven's fame has endured for more than 200 years. But if you endure something, you suffer through it: We endured our teacher's slide shows of her vacation photographs.</li><li>Notice above that something that endures can be good or bad. Something you endure is always bad. And people are forever talking about what they can't or won't endure, as in ""I refuse to endure any more abuse from my neighbors."" Endure derives from the Latin indūrāre ""to make hard,"" formed from the prefix in- ""against, into"" plus dūrus ""hard.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1311,"<ul><li>To execute means to carry out in full or perform. If you execute all the difficult steps of the dance perfectly, you will make your instructor proud.</li><li>Here’s what’s tricky about execute: the first thing you think of is being punished with death for criminal actions. Actually, it's more commonly used in the sense of “to carry out in full.” So don't be alarmed with visions of the hooded guy at the guillotine when someone congratulates you on a plan well executed. Think of the word executive to get a closer grasp of both the meaning and the context.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1312,"<ul><li>To grasp is to get a hold of something, literally or figuratively. Grasp the grammar textbook with both hands and then read it to grasp the rules of the English language.</li><li>It makes sense that the word grasp means understanding a concept since you are ""getting a hold of an idea"" just as you would grasp something tangible to hold. Grasp is good for when you're talking about comprehending the scale of something, or the full picture of a multi-faceted problem or idea. You might know that there is going to be a heat wave, but you may not grasp the idea of its relationship to global warming.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1313,"<ul><li>The rear is the back end of something, like the rear of a school bus or the members of the marching band who stand at the rear of the parade.</li><li>At the other end of something's front is its rear, whether it's a car or a line of people standing outside a theater. You can also use rear informally to mean ""bottom"" or ""hindquarters,"" as an adjective meaning ""toward the back,"" or as a verb: ""The horses started to rear up on their back legs."" The verb comes from a Germanic root meaning ""to raise,"" while the noun is rooted in the Latin retro, ""behind.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1314,"<ul><li>A senator is a person who works in the government. In the United States, senators are elected by voters to represent them in a state or federal senate.</li><li>Each state in the US elects two senators who serve six-year terms in Washington, DC, where they pass laws and vote on policies. Other countries have senators as well, either elected or appointed. The word senator has been used in English since around 1200, from the Latin word, senex, or ""old man."" This is especially appropriate when you know that men have far outnumbered women in the US senate and that the first female senator wasn't elected until 1932.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1315,"<ul><li>The bones of a person's or animal's head make up the skull. All vertebrates have a skull. Pirate flags often feature a human skull and crossbones (because a parrot skull wouldn’t be nearly so scary).</li><li>The wide-eyed head of a skeleton is its skull. Skulls are hard and bony, but they're a little bit flexible as well—characteristics that help them protect the brain they enclose. Your skull consists of two parts: the bones of your face and the neurocranium, or ""braincase."" The precise origin of skull is uncertain, but it probably traces back to the Old English scealu, ""husk or shell.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1316,"<ul><li>To stir is to mix something up. You can literally stir cake batter with a spoon, or figuratively stir someone's emotions by writing them a heartfelt letter.</li><li>You can stir muffin batter with a wooden spoon, and stir in a cup of blueberries. When people stir, they start to move after being still or asleep: ""It was only five o'clock, but he could hear the kids start to stir."" And when something stirs you, it brings up some emotion: ""That music always stirs up my sad memories."" Stir shares a root with the Old Norse styrr, ""tumult or disturbance.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1317,"<ul><li>To tap is to lightly hit something, the way you tap your friend on the shoulder to get her attention or tap your foot against the floor when you're listening to music.</li><li>Your fingers tap the keyboard when you write an essay, and if you take tap dancing lessons, you'll spend time tapping your toes in tap shoes. Another kind of tap is a spigot that liquid or gas flows from, or the secret listening device a spy might use. As a verb, it can also mean ""make use of,"" the way you tap into your sister's jar of change when you need an extra dollar or two.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U06_1318,"<ul><li>Tremendous means extraordinarily large in size, extent, amount, power, or degree. It can also mean really marvelous and fantastic — or really awful and terrible.</li><li>We often use tremendous if something is super wonderful. If someone comes into your office and tells you you just won a big contract and are getting a huge bonus, you might exclaim, “Tremendous!” Tremendous comes from the Latin for ""trembling,"" and is connected with fear. Something tremendous can be big in a terrifying way, like the tremendous noise of an approaching hurricane, or a tremendous tidal wave about to crash on the shore.</li></ul>"

The worms that hang out in your garden are very helpful, keeping the soil rich and fertile.</li><li>Worm can be a contemptuous term for a weak person — and while most worms cause us no harm at all, there are dozens of worms that we'd be better off avoiding. Many worms are parasites, feeding on their host's body. Intestinal worms get into a human or animal's digestive system and make them sick. As a verb, to worm is to move or wriggle with difficulty: ""Everyone glares as she worms her way up to the front of the line.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1321,"<ul><li>To abandon something is to give it up completely. If you’re in a cabin and a forest fire approaches, you’d better get in your car and abandon your cabin, or else be prepared to abandon your life.</li><li>If you abandon something, you let it go, so when you describe someone as ""acting with abandon,"" it means they have let go of restrictions or inhibitions. Maybe you like to dance with abandon in the privacy of your own room. But abandon could also mean people have abandoned their senses. To ""drive with abandon,"" for example, means to drive recklessly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1322,"<ul><li>Ambitious means wanting to succeed. If you want to climb Mount Everest, start your own business, and write a great philosophical treatise all before you are 30, then wow, you are really ambitious.</li><li>Having an ambition is a good thing, like wanting to get good grades, or to become a doctor. But if we say someone is ambitious, often we mean they have too much ambition. An ambitious politician might want power so badly that he’ll abandon his ideals in order to win a race. If you hatch a business plan and someone tells you it’s too ambitious, that means you’re probably not being reasonable about how much you can get done.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1323,"<ul><li>A bark is the loud, sharp sound a dog makes. Seals also bark, and people sometimes bark with laughter or bark out commands.</li><li>Bark is both a noun and a verb: if your dog is known for his noisy bark, it means that he barks all the time. There is also the type of bark that covers the trunk of a tree, and yet another bark, an old-fashioned word for a masted ship. When you ""bark up the wrong tree,"" you have completely misunderstood a situation, the way a squirrel-chasing dog does when she literally barks in the wrong direction.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1324,"<ul><li>A bay is an inlet along the shoreline of a body of water.  A bay window occupies a similar inlet in a room.  When you keep someone ""at bay"" you hold them off.</li><li>The different meanings of bay come from different origins. For example, the idea of the word as a cove comes from the Latin bāia, while the idea of an opening is a wall is from the Latin batāre, meaning ""gape."" The word that means a dog's howl, however, comes from the Latin baubari, which means ""to bark."" Other meanings of this versatile word include a horse with reddish coloring, and a tree with leaves used to add flavor in cooking.  There's nothing quite like riding a bay along the scenic bay while listening to the hounds bay!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1325,"<ul><li>Brilliant describes something super bright, like intense lights at a football stadium, a super sparkly diamond, or the student who graduates from Harvard at age 13.</li><li>Brilliant comes from the Italian word brillare, to ""sparkle"" like those bright lights, diamonds, and brainiac kid. British people love to say things are ""Brilliant!"" in the same way Americans say ""Awesome!"" Brilliant describes anything sparkly, fabulous, or full of light. A bright color is brilliant, too, like the brilliant orange of a setting sun.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1326,"<ul><li>Your chin is the somewhat pointy part of your jaw at the bottom of your face, below your mouth. When a man has a bushy beard, it usually covers his cheeks and his chin.</li><li>Humans are unique in having a chin — it's thought to have evolved in part from our habit of using speech. When chin is a verb, it means to do a pull up on an exercise bar, lifting your full weight until your chin touches the bar. In the late 16th century, to chin meant to affectionately rub chins with someone else, and in 1880s American slang, it also meant ""to gossip.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1327,"<ul><li>A complaint is an objection to something that is unfair, unacceptable, or otherwise not up to normal standards. If your neighbors have a complaint about noise, they want you to be more quiet.</li><li>A complaint is voiced objection to something, like a complaint about cold or disgusting-tasting food in a restaurant. Complaint is also a legal term — the plaintiff's reasons for bringing a civil action. Medically speaking, a complaint is a disorder or disease that is hard to cure completely. Loud cries of pain, anger, or sadness can also be called complaints.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1328,"<ul><li>If you're deaf, you can't hear or have extremely limited hearing abilities. Many people who are deaf communicate using sign language.</li><li>Some people are born deaf, while others lose their hearing later in life because of illness or injury. People who have been deaf their whole lives and are actively involved with the deaf community consider deafness a ""difference in experience,"" not a disability. When someone accuses you of being ""deaf to"" their argument, they mean that you are refusing to pay attention or listen. Until the 18th century, deaf was pronounced so it rhymed with beef.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1329,"<ul><li>Enthusiastic appreciation for something is more than just liking it — it's loving it. You're an enthusiastic fan of Italian food if you not only like it, you can't live without it.</li><li>Enthusiastic's Greek origins paint a vivid picture of how an enthusiastic person got that way, as the word literally means ""possessed by a god."" You may recognize the ""god"" part of the word — theos, as in theology — ""the study of God."" If you're enthusiastic about working on your vocabulary words, you don't have to be reminded to do it — you can't wait.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1330,"<ul><li>An expedition is an organized journey that is undertaken for a particular purpose, like a group of scientists launching an expedition to South America to seek out a new medicinal herb.</li><li>An expedition is no walk in the park. It's a serious journey, often with a very specific purpose undertaken by several people and lots of equipment. Sometimes, it can even be dangerous, like when the arctic adventurer was attacked by polar bears during an expedition to the Arctic. Needless to say, he hung up his explorer's hat after that expedition.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1331,"<ul><li>When you look out your window and note the furthest point you can see––the line where the sky meets the earth––that edge is called the horizon. Horizon can also mean the edge of something in a figurative sense.</li><li>When you are thinking about your life, it can be difficult to get very far beyond where you are. Teenagers have a hard time imagining beyond the horizons of young adulthood. People expecting a baby often put much of their focus on infancy––having a child who can sit up or even walk is beyond the horizons of their thinking.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1332,"<ul><li>If you are faithful and devoted to someone or something, you're loyal. If you refuse to buy milk from anyone other than Farmer Jones, then you're a very loyal customer.</li><li>Someone who is loyal is reliable and always true, like your trusty dog. Loyal comes from the Old French word loial which means something like ""legal,"" but if someone is only loyal to you because the law requires him to be, that's not true loyalty, which should come from the heart, not a contract. A loyal friend supports you all the time, no matter what. You can also be loyal to an idea, like the People's Revolution, or girl-power.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1333,"<ul><li>The mayor is the leader of a city. He or she heads the city government. Just as a president leads a country, a mayor leads a city. Like other politicians, mayors must run for office and win an election.</li><li>The word mayor comes from the Old French maire for ""head of a city or town government"" but most mayors probably like the original meaning, which is ""greater, superior."" Alas, mayors do run cities but calling them all superior is a stretch! In the United States, the president leads the country, a governor leads a state, and a mayor leads a city. If it’s used as a title for a particular mayor, as in Mayor Smith, it’s capitalized.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1334,"<ul><li>If the feeling is mutual, both of you feel the same the way, like a mutual admiration society. Mutual means shared. In finance it is used to describe trusts or funds that pool the money of many investors to buy securities.</li><li>Mutual is a word to describe something two people or groups share. Nations will engage in a policy of mutual support; co-workers make a mutual effort; two businesses reach a mutual understanding. It's a good thing, being mutual. Mutual consent means you and your partner agree to do something together, be it composting your refuse in the backyard or dressing in furry mascot costumes for kicks. If something is mutual, it's okay with everyone involved.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U07_1336,"<ul><li>To take refuge is to find a safe place. You might take refuge under a bridge in a hail storm, or in a basement during a tornado.</li><li>Refuge comes from a French word meaning ""to flee,"" and, in most cases, a refuge is a place to flee to in order to get away from people or places that are unsafe. A refuge is a safe place, such as a building or even another country, as in ""they sought refuge from the war by leaving their homeland,"" or it is a simple, personal place of comfort — like a friend's couch.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1337,"<ul><li>If you restore furniture for a living, you clean and repair it to bring it back to its original beauty.</li><li>When you restore something, you are simply bringing it back to what it once was. You are not making it better, nor are you adding something that wasn't there. You can restore a damaged reputation, your health, or an old house, though the latter may be easiest of those three to accomplish. If the electricity goes out, you will have to sit in the dark until the power is restored.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U07_1338,"<ul><li>To rub is to push firmly and repeatedly, like when you rub your sore foot. When Hamlet says, ""aye, there's the rub,"" he's not talking about getting a massage. Rub, as a noun, is an obstacle or something in your way.</li><li>You can rub someone's aching back or rub sunblock on your arms and legs. You can also watch chunks of melting ice on a lake's surface rub against each other or complain that your new shoes rub your heels and give you blisters. Colloquially, you might rub off on your friends, or begin to influence them by your mere presence. If, however, you rub them the wrong way, you irritate or annoy them. The noun rub is not used nearly as often as the verb, but people do love to allude to Hamlet's ""aye, there's the rub"" line in the ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy, referring to the unforeseen dreams of death that haunt mankind.</li></ul>"

When it’s time for your dog to get his shots, you take him to the veterinarian.</li><li>A veterinarian is someone who treats, cures, and prevents diseases in animals. If you want to become a veterinarian, start studying hard! Much like a people doctor, a veterinarian must have formal training before practicing — typically 4 years of veterinary medicine coursework after completing an undergraduate degree. The word veterinarian is often shortened to “vet.” You might look at your dog and say, “Time to go to the vet!”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1341,"<ul><li>An anniversary marks the date on which an event happened — a five-year wedding anniversary occurs exactly five years after a wedding.</li><li>When someone refers to ""our anniversary,"" they are typically talking about the day they were married. News organizations regularly recognize the anniversaries of important people's births and deaths, plus anniversaries of significant news events and national tragedies, like Sept. 11 2001 or Dec. 7, 1941. This word comes from Latin; remember that annus means year and you can relate the word to annual. Sometimes the world is used more loosely, like when new couples celebrate their one-month anniversary.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1342,"<ul><li>Arithmetic is another word for math, specifically the areas of math having to do with numbers and calculating.</li><li>If you're good at adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying, then you're good at arithmetic, which is a big part of math. Arithmetic has to do with doing calculations. To answer most math problems, including almost all word problems, you need arithmetic. The most basic arithmetic is 2 plus 2, but as anyone who's ever taken algebra can tell you, it can get a lot more complicated than that.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1343,"<ul><li>When you have done something you know you shouldn't have, or just something embarrassing, you feel ashamed, or remorseful.  Don't be ashamed of your unusual dance moves — you were the life of the party!</li><li>The word ashamed has, in some form, been around since before the 11th Century.  You might feel less ashamed of your mistakes if you're able to learn from them.  As Jonathan Swift put it, ""A man should never be ashamed to own that he has been in the wrong, which is but saying... that he is wiser today than yesterday.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1344,"<ul><li>A burst is a sudden flurry of activity. Bursts of energy are helpful in shoveling heavy snow, but it's better if you work steadily instead of shoveling fast and stopping.</li><li>As a verb, burst is your go-to action word to describe something sudden and energetic happening. It usually means, ""to explode outward, with noise"" like if you burst into song in the middle of study hall, startling everyone. It also means, “to split open in a violent way due to internal pressure” like an overfilled water balloon. It comes from the Old English word berstan, meaning ""break suddenly.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1345,"<ul><li>A carpenter is a person who makes things out of wood. You could hire a carpenter to build you a dining room table and two long benches.</li><li>Carpenters specialize in woodworking, making furniture and buildings from wood and repairing various wooden things. If you wanted beautiful handmade wooden cabinets in your kitchen, you'd hire a carpenter. The word has been around since the 14th century, but it's been a common last name for even longer. It comes from the Late Latin carpentarius, ""wagon maker,"" with its root word carpentum, ""wagon.""</li></ul>"

Most of the electricity that's produced in the world is powered by the burning of coal.</li><li>Coal may seem like an old-fashioned fuel, making you think of steam locomotives that ran on coal, or coal fires heating homes in the nineteenth century. Some people still burn coal in stoves today, although most coal is burned on a much larger scale, generating electricity for entire towns and cities. You can also use the noun coal to mean a glowing ember in your fireplace or backyard grill. In Old English, it was col, from a Germanic root.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1347,"<ul><li>A couch is a sofa — an upholstered piece of furniture that seats more than one person. It's nice to have a couch that's big enough for your whole family to sit on while you watch TV.</li><li>The word couch comes from the French word coucher, meaning to lie down. Some types of couches are indeed meant for lying down. A psychiatrist's couch, for example, was designed to make patients feel comfortable when discussing their problems. In language, to couch is to phrase your words in a certain manner. If you don't want to hurt your friend's feelings, you should couch your words carefully when you tell her that her everyone is leaving her party early.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1348,"<ul><li>When water flows slowly in tiny drops, it drips. The movement of water in this way is called a drip.</li><li>Have you ever had a leaky faucet? Then you probably know a drip is water leaking out one drop at a time: drip drip drip. A broken faucet has a drip, and you can say the water is dripping. When it rains, it usually starts dripping before it rains harder. When you turn on the shower, it might start as drips. Once the water is flowing strongly and in a stream, it's not dripping anymore.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1349,"<ul><li>Nimble ballerinas and long-legged birds are elegant; dump trucks and walruses usually are not.</li><li>Being graceful and refined are aspects of being elegant. That word first appears in English in the 15th century. It comes, via Old French, from the same Latin source that gave rise to the English word ""elect, and it does seem that especially elegant people and things are in a select group. Very stylishly dressed men and women are elegant, and fine restaurants with distinctive delicacies are elegant. Most ordinary places and people can become elegant, though, when dressed up or adorned for special occasions. Even walruses can appear elegant when they're swimming.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1350,"<ul><li>Fabric is what something is made from, especially clothing. Silk is a common fabric, but you can also talk about ""the fabric of society.""</li><li>The most common use of fabric is for clothes: for example, denim is the fabric used to make jeans. All clothes are made of some type or combination of fabrics. The basic structure of a building or a vehicle can also be called fabric, and non-physical things can be represented as fabric too. Metaphorically, you could say honesty is part of the fabric of friendship, or love is part of the fabric of family. Fabric is always the foundation or essence of something.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U08_1352,"<ul><li>Ivory is a hard, white substance found in the tusks of animals such as elephants. Ivory also refers to a white-ish color, like the ivory keys on a piano.</li><li>One of the most prized animal products is ivory, which comes from the tusks of elephants and walruses. Ivory — which is extremely hard dentine — is used in many objects, especially expensive, decorative ones such as statues. Unfortunately, the elephant population is endangered due to hunting elephants for their ivory, so this pretty substance comes at a high price. Ivory is also the name of a color that is close to the shade of bleached bones or pearl.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1353,"<ul><li>A mill is a factory or plant, especially one that's equipped for grinding grain into flour. The facility is a mill, and the machine that does the actual grinding is also called a mill.</li><li>When a mill crushes and grinds grain like wheat or corn, you can say it mills flour. Other kinds of mills might mill powder or coffee — and still other mills don't actually grind anything; instead, they manufacture things like steel or paper. If someone ""mills around,"" they wander or move about in a confused way: ""The crowd mills around during the concert's intermission."" This sense of mill was originally used to describe cattle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1354,"<ul><li>A needle is a small, pointed piece of metal that's used in medicine or sewing. When a tailor sews a button on your shirt or even when a doctor sews your skin back together, a needle is used.</li><li>Needles are sharp — when you stitch fabric with a needle, you might use a metal thimble to protect your fingertip. When a doctor or nurse uses a needle, it needs to be very sharp — it has to be able to penetrate human skin to stitch up a wound or inject a medication. When you needle someone, you don't literally poke them, but you do annoy or provoke them in some way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1355,"<ul><li>When you polish something, you rub and buff it until it shines. You might need to polish your reading glasses from time to time.</li><li>You might polish your wooden coffee table with a cloth or polish beach stones until they gleam. Polish is also a noun, meaning either the spray you use to shine up your furniture or the shininess itself: ""The polish on that desk is unbelievable — I can almost see my reflection in it!"" There is also a figurative kind of polish, a sort of elegance or clarity you might see in well-edited writing or a fashionable woman sliding into a taxi.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1356,"<ul><li>Sew describes stitching something together. If you sew up the holes in your socks, you use thread and a needle to close them.</li><li>The word sew comes from the Old English word siwian, to stitch. You can sew a patch on a pair of jeans, sew a dress, or sew up a hole in your grandmother's old quilt. A figurative meaning of sew, as in the phrase to sew something up, is to secure something or bring it to a happy conclusion, like sewing up the plot in the last chapter of a book. Don't confuse sew with sow, to plant or set in motion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1357,"<ul><li>The small, simple building in your yard where you keep tools or gardening equipment is a shed.</li><li>As a noun, shed means ""hut,"" and probably comes from the word shade. But shed is also a verb meaning ""to cast off,"" like when a snake sheds its skin.  If your couch is covered in fur, it might be because your dog is shedding.  You can shed non-physical things, like a bad habit.  Does your cat shed?  If so, maybe I should sleep in the shed since I'm allergic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1358,"<ul><li>Thread is a length of twisted fibers (usually three strands together), made from cotton, silk, or other material, that can be used in sewing, quilting, embroidery, and other handicrafts.</li><li>The noun thread can also be used figuratively to refer to different parts of something, like thoughts or a conversation, that are connected as if joined by thread. If you were distracted by a crash in the kitchen, you might lose the thread of your conversation. Thread can also refer to the raised ridge on the outside of a screw or bolt, and you can use thread as a verb when you mean to string or to pass a thread through a needle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U08_1359,"<ul><li>When you cut something, literally or figuratively, you trim it. If you have steady hands, you can trim your own bangs. If you don't have steady hands, you can save up for a professional haircut by trimming the amount of money you spend on comics and snacks.</li><li>A landscaper trims the grass and shrubs, and a cook trims fat off of meat before cooking it. But when you trim the Christmas tree, you decorate it, and when a sailor trims the sails, she adjusts them so they'll catch the wind just right. And as a noun, a trim is ""an act of cutting,"" while trim is ""decoration."" All forms of this word are rooted in nautical language.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U09_1361,"<ul><li>If you have an ally, you have someone who is on your side, like a more experienced teammate who is your ally in convincing the coach to give you more playing time.</li><li>Ally comes from the Latin word alligare, meaning ""to bind to,"" like nations who are allies in wartime — they will act together, and protect one another. You can also use ally as a verb, meaning ""join forces with."" For example, you might ally yourself with influential people to advance your career. As a noun, pronounce ally like this: ""AL-eye."" As a verb, it's ""uh-LIE.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1362,"<ul><li>When you boast you are bragging about yourself and your accomplishments (or maybe those of your family), often to the boredom and annoyance of your audience.</li><li>Used as either a noun or a verb, boast usually suggests exaggeration, vanity, or pride. Along those lines, English poet Sir Thomas Overbury, who died in 1613, once said, ""The man who has nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestry is like the potato — the best part underground."" However, the word can also be used in a positive way: a town can boast a new library, or a school can boast a high graduation rate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1363,"<ul><li>Bounce is a word for an up and down movement or recovery — like a ball's bounce on the pavement or the stock market's rise after a crash.</li><li>Bounce can be a noun or a verb. A basketball player bounces a ball on the floor and it springs back into her hand.  Trampolines have a lot of bounce in them; that's why they are fun to jump on.  Good dance music makes you want to bounce up and down.  The phrase “bounce back” describes how you might recover after a bad situation.  Did you slip and suffer a painful bounce on the floor?  Some hot chocolate will help you ""bounce back.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1364,"<ul><li>You might still have terrifying dreams about the bully who harassed you on the playground in second grade. A bully is someone who intimidates people, usually those who are weaker or smaller.</li><li>The classic example of a bully is a mean kid in a schoolyard who hassles or beats up younger students. While a child or a teenager can be a bully, so is anyone who uses power or strength to scare or harm other people. The word bully has gone through a mysterious evolution, from the 1530s when it meant ""sweetheart,"" through the 17th century's meanings of ""fine fellow,"" then ""blusterer,"" and finally ""harasser of the weak.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1365,"<ul><li>The word carbohydrate refers to a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen that is a major source of energy for animals. Carbohydrates can be found in many foods — especially in a plate of spaghetti.</li><li>Often formed by a plant, a carbohydrate may be a sugar, starch, or cellulose that typically breaks down into energy within the body. So when you hydrate — or “water” — a carbon in just the right way, it can lead to the stuff that makes up bread, pasta, apples, beans, and potatoes. Carbohydrate often goes by its less threatening nickname carb, though beware: abbreviating the word does nothing to lessen its calories.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1366,"<ul><li>To crawl is to move slowly across the floor on your hands and knees. Before they learn to walk, most babies crawl.</li><li>You might crawl around looking for a lost earring, or watch a spider crawl across your ceiling. The slow, creeping movement itself is a crawl, too: ""Traffic was moving at a crawl."" When your dog has fleas, he crawls with them, and if something gives you a creepy, prickling sensation, it makes your skin crawl. Crawl probably comes from the Old Norse krafla, ""to claw one's way,"" which shares a root with crab.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1367,"<ul><li>Defeat is the opposite of victory. When you lose, you suffer defeat. When you win, you defeat your enemy.</li><li>This is a word that's all about losing. In World War II, America and the Allies defeated the Axis powers: we beat them. In basketball, Michael Jordan usually defeated his opponents. Any loss can be called a defeat. When you're disappointed or think that nothing is going right, you feel defeated. If you're determined to win, you could say, ""I won't accept defeat!"" Some people are so stubborn that even though they've obviously been defeated, they won't admit defeat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1368,"<ul><li>A dial is a circle that has a series of numbers or marks representing numbers, like the dial of a clock face, a compass, or an old-fashioned telephone. If you have a watch that glows in the dark, it's the dial you can see even in a dark movie theater.</li><li>Old telephones and televisions both have dials — the first has numbers from zero to nine in a circle, and the latter has a round disc for changing channels. When you call someone, you can say that you dial their number. In fact, people tend to use the word dial when they use a phone, even if they're pushing buttons or tapping a touch screen. The Latin root is dialis, ""daily,"" and the earliest dial was a sundial.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1369,"<ul><li>Dominant means to be in control. In a wolf pack, one male wolf fights the others, wins, and becomes the dominant wolf in the group.</li><li>Dominant derives from the Latin dominus which means ""lord or master."" If you grew up with a Latin mass, you will recognize this as one of many words for God. If you're dominant, it means you treat others as if you're their master. You can also use dominant to describe something frequent or common. For example, when cell phones first came out, their dominant use was for making calls. Now cells phone do so much more, some people hardly make calls on them at all.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1370,"<ul><li>Think of the word entire as referring to all of anything. Now think of that ""all"" as being whole — not broken or lacking in any way. Remember that, and you will have the entire meaning of the word.</li><li>Entire is based on the Latin integrum, which came from the prefix in-, ""not,"" and tangere, ""to touch,"" and thus means ""untouched."" From there it developed into the 14th-century Old French entier, meaning ""unbroken or complete,"" and then, through Middle English, into our modern word entire. One use of the word you don't see every day is to describe an uncastrated horse — an ""entire horse"" is a stallion. Gives a pretty interesting picture of the word, doesn't it?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1371,"<ul><li>Compassion leads you to have mercy, which is like forgiveness. If you have mercy on someone, you let them off the hook or are kind to them somehow.</li><li>This is a quality that has to do with compassion, forgiveness, and leniency. If convicted of a crime, you might plead for the judge's mercy, meaning a lesser punishment. When people say ""May God have mercy on me!"" they're asking for forgiveness. Mercy may be given or received. You might show your little cousin mercy by not forcing him to eat a worm. People jokingly say a bad singer is showing mercy if she ends the show early.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1372,"<ul><li>When you nod, you shake your head up and down, as if you're indicating agreement. If you want to say ""Yes"" without uttering a single word, all you have to do is nod.</li><li>There's the deliberate nod, when you agree with someone by raising and lowering your chin, and then there's the accidental nod — when you're so sleepy that your eyes close and your head dips down. You can even say you ""nod off to sleep"" in this case. If you know someone well enough to nod at them when you pass, but not well enough to stop and chat, you can call that person ""a nodding acquaintance.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1373,"<ul><li>An opponent is your competition, whether it's a rival hockey team, or the other finalist in the chess tournament. Coaches tell you to never underestimate your opponent.</li><li>Someone who competes or fights against you is your opponent. If you're arguing that chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla, the vanilla ice cream fan is your opponent. An opponent can also be someone who opposes, like an opponent of gun control laws. The Latin word opponent means setting against, and it was first used in English to describe the person who would begin a certain type of philosophical debate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1374,"<ul><li>To quarrel is to fight — but usually not physically. Quarreling is a fact of life, occurring between the best of friends, in the happiest of marriages, and between parents and their children.</li><li>You’re probably familiar with the verb, quarrel, meaning having a disagreement.  When there’s a quarrel, there’s anger. As a noun, quarrel, refers to the square-headed arrow shot from crossbow. This meaning of the word comes from the Old French quarel, relating to ""square.” If you are quarreling, just don't reach for your crossbow and quarrel.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1375,"<ul><li>A rival is a competitor or contender that you want to defeat, whether in an actual competition or for another goal. It may be a tennis rival or a rival for your true love’s affections.</li><li>There are all types of rivals, but they tend to show up a lot in sports. For example, in college football, the Army and Navy have been rivals since their first meeting in 1890. Something that is able to rival something else is seen as comparable to it in quality, and something that is said to be “without rival” is unmatched, or better than everything else.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1376,"<ul><li>A sore is a broken patch of skin — something you might put a bandage on — or it's something that gives you pain, like a sore throat, that’s red and scratchy and painful.</li><li>You can have a sore and you can also be sore: if you've just ridden your bike over the Alps, you're probably pretty sore — achy and hurting all over. Maybe you've heard phrases like ""Don't be sore at me, boss,"" from old gangster movies, meaning ""don't be angry."" A sore point or a sore subject is something you don't want to discuss, like the sensitive topic of your last history quiz, the one you slept through.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1377,"<ul><li>Sting most commonly refers to the wound inflicted by a bee or hornet, or to a kind of burning pain, like the brief sting when your doctor gives you a vaccine. A nasty remark can also sting.</li><li>""Float like a butterfly. Sting like a bee!"" was Muhammad Ali's famous taunt to other fighters. But insects and boxers aren't the only ones who can sting. When someone says something that's both mean and true, it can sting. Such things are often referred to as stinging remarks. But if you're thinking crime, then a sting is a con-job that takes planning to pull off. When the cops spend months creating a fake crime-ring in order to catch criminals in the act, it's referred to a ""sting operation.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1378,"<ul><li>The noun strain is a stretch, effort, or exertion. You can strain your ankle, or your little brother can strain your patience.</li><li>This word has many, many meanings. Athletes strain their knees, which strains the emotions of their fans. Usually, you have to strain a little to accomplish anything, like getting an A in math. A strain may also be a line, like a line of ancestry, of thought, or a melodic line in music. Maybe you have to strain to hear the quiet flute in an orchestra. Another meaning is to pass something through a filter, like tea leaves.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1379,"<ul><li>To torture is to torment or purposefully put someone through intense pain or agony.</li><li>The word torture comes from the word for ""harm."" It can refer to the deliberate infliction of physical or mental suffering in order to punish or obtain information; the act of distorting something, so it means something it wasn't intended to mean; or extreme mental distress or unbearable physical pain not necessarily inflicted by another.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U09_1380,"<ul><li>If you decide to wrestle on a team in high school, you'll be grabbing your opponent and trying to fling him to the ground while he tries to do the same to you. You might want to consider the ping pong team instead.</li><li>Athletes wrestle wearing uniforms and helmets, and they follow very specific rules. Others wrestle more spontaneously — a bar bouncer might have to wrestle with an unruly patron, or a parent might need to wrestle a squirming toddler into her car seat. Yet another way to wrestle is with an idea or a problem, a kind of mental struggle. The Old English root, wræstan, means ""to wrest,"" or to yank something out of another person's grasp.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1381,"<ul><li>Absence is the state of not being someplace, like school. It can also refer to the amount of time something has been, or plans to be gone.</li><li>We most commonly think of absence as the opposite of present in places school, but really it can refer to anything that's missing or something that's lacking. Darkness is an absence of light, and cold is an absence of heat. The figure of speech ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" means ""when my beloved isn't here, my feelings for them get even stronger"" or ""when something's gone, you want it even more.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1382,"<ul><li>If you read something aloud you use your voice, not just your eyes. You might feel shy reading your poems aloud in front of strangers.</li><li>Aloud used to mean ""very loudly,"" but now we use it to mean ""speaking voice"" as opposed to the silent voice of our thoughts. You might have to read something aloud to your grandmother if she's having trouble with her eyes. If you accidentally said something that you meant to keep to yourself, you were thinking aloud. If something is terribly painful, you might cry aloud — unable to contain yourself.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1383,"<ul><li>Use the adjective bald to describe someone who has no hair on his head. If your uncle has a smooth, hairless scalp, he's bald.</li><li>Some men are bald because they shave their heads, while others have become bald gradually over the years. It's often said that if a man's grandfather was bald, he will also be bald. Certain conditions, illnesses, and even medicines can also make women bald. Another way to use the word is to mean ""plain, blunt, or obvious."" You might describe, for example, a school's bald request for donations of money and supplies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1384,"<ul><li>A blanket is a large piece of material that keeps you warm when you're in bed or taking a nap on the couch. Many small children have a favorite blanket that provides not just warmth, but comfort.</li><li>There is the knitted blanket on your bed, and then there's the blanket of snow that covers your yard in January. Any heavy layer can be described this way: ""After a windy day, there was suddenly a blanket of leaves outside."" You can use it as a verb, too: ""The fog descended and began to blanket the whole town."" The Old French root is blanchet, ""light wool or flannel cloth,"" from blanc, ""white"" or ""white cloth.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1385,"<ul><li>A beetle creeps along the ground. Moving slowly and silently, it creeps up on you. When you feel the touch of tiny insect legs on your skin, you shudder, because bugs give you the creeps.</li><li>Creep has a long history and a subtle variety of meanings. In its earliest recorded usage, it described the movement of legless creatures like snakes and worms. By the sixteenth century, creep meant ""move slowly"" and ""move with stealth"" like when you creep up to your brother to startle him. Charles Dickens coined the phrase, the creeps, to suggest the shuddering sensation you get when you see something gross and scary. A creep is a person who makes your skin crawl, a meaning that has been used in American English since 1935.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1386,"<ul><li>A divorce is a formal ending of a marriage. It’s more permanent than a separation and involves a legal process. If you get a divorce, that means the marriage is officially over.</li><li>Divorce has both a noun and a verb form. The noun describes the thing you get — ""you are getting a divorce."" And the verb describes the thing you do — ""you are divorcing your spouse."" Divorce can also be used more broadly to describe any major separation. You might know of a politician who divorces himself from a controversial issue — that means he doesn’t want to be associated with it at all.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1387,"<ul><li>When you imitate someone, you copy them. Youth marketers capitalize on kids' desire to imitate––tweens imitate teens, teens imitate young adults, and marketers supply the product lines to make it easy.</li><li>Humans learn by imitating others. Babies carefully watch their caregivers' lips, learning to imitate the movements they make to create language sounds. Writers often begin their careers imitating the style of older writers they admire.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1388,"<ul><li>An infant is a baby. When you were an infant, you weren't able to walk, talk, or feed yourself (but you had a pretty mean burp).</li><li>Infant is most often used for a very young human, but you can also use it to talk about animal babies. People are considered infants from the moment of birth until approximately one year old, an age when many babies are starting to walk and talk. At this point, they're commonly called toddlers instead of infants. The Latin root is infantem, which as a noun means ""babe in arms,"" and as an adjective ""unable to speak.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1389,"<ul><li>To kidnap is to steal a person, or to hold someone as a prisoner until a ransom is paid.</li><li>The original meaning of kidnap, dating from the late seventeenth century, was ""steal children to provide servants to the American colonies,"" from kid, ""child,"" and nap, ""snatch away."" After the particularly notorious Lindberg baby kidnapping in 1932, the U.S. Congress passed a law allowing the FBI to investigate all kidnappings. Today the word kidnap includes all abductions, of both children and adults.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1390,"<ul><li>If you’re really tired during the day, go ahead and take a nap, even if you have to hide under your desk. A nap is a brief sleep. Good night.</li><li>When you take a nap, you rest, usually during the daytime. In some cultures, everybody naps after lunch, while in other places naps are only for young children and elderly people. Sigh. A second meaning of nap is ""slightly fuzzy texture,"" like the nap of a jacket or the nap of a rug. This kind of nap stems from the Middle Low German noppe, ""tuft of wool.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1391,"<ul><li>If you're going nowhere, you have no particular destination — nowhere isn't any place at at all.</li><li>If you're invited nowhere on New Year's Eve, you'll probably stay home — there's not anywhere to go. And if your dog is nowhere to be seen, he's not in your yard, the neighbor's yard, or anyplace else visible. Sometimes the word is also used to mean ""a particularly boring or remote place,"" like when your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, or your parents warn that if you don't do well in school, you'll go nowhere in life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1392,"<ul><li>When you pat, you tap lightly with your hand. A sad friend might be comforted by a kind pat on the shoulder. But that sad friend would not be comforted by a pat, insincere, comment.</li><li>Your grandfather might pat you on the head just like when you were little, even though you're taller than he is now. Dogs like getting a pat on the head, or maybe a pat of butter from the dinner table. When it's an adjective, pat means ""way too simple"" or ""glib,"" as in ""I asked a serious question — please don't give me a pat answer."" To ""have something down pat"" is to know it by heart.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1393,"<ul><li>The noun relief means ""the act of reducing something unpleasant,"" like medicine that brings relief from your terrible headache.</li><li>Relief has several meanings. It can refer to help or assistance, like disaster relief, or a change for the better: it was a relief when you finally found your car keys. Relief also means ""someone who takes the place of another,"" like a relief pitcher who steps in to finish the game. A relief is also a type of sculpture with shapes carved to stand out from the background.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1394,"<ul><li>To reproduce is to make more, either by having babies or creating copies. Parents and copy machines both reproduce.</li><li>To produce is ""to make something,"" and re means “again,” so reproduce literally means to “produce again.” When animals and plants make more of their own kind, they reproduce. Plants reproduce asexually, and people reproduce through childbirth. You can also reproduce a book by printing more copies or a computer file by copying it. Reproducing always creates more of something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1395,"<ul><li>A rhyme is when the ending sounds of two words sound alike — like ""mouse"" and ""house"" or ""complain"" and ""sustain."" If you have a knack for rhyme, you might have a bright future as a poet.</li><li>“True wit is nature to advantage dress'd; / What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd”: lines of rhyme written by English poet Alexander Pope.  The way “dress’d” and “express’d” sound, that’s rhyme.  Rhyme shares the same Latin root as rhythm, and poetry that rhymes does have a rhythm to it, like in a song.  Rhyme is a noun for similar sounds or a poem that uses rhyme, and it’s also a verb, like saying, “What rhymes with orange?”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1396,"<ul><li>To suck is to draw something by force. Vacuum cleaners suck dirt from the floor and milkshake drinkers suck this liquid, tasty liquid through a straw.</li><li>Drinking something by pulling it into your mouth is to suck it. You can also suck on something, like a peppermint or a thumb, by holding it in your mouth. Objects can suck too — a fan sucks warm air out the window. You can also suck someone into your plans, meaning you force them to participate. The word suck comes from the Proto-Indo-European sug, from the sound your mouth makes when you suck on something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1397,"<ul><li>If something is urgent it requires immediate attention or action. If you break your leg, you'll need urgent attention at the hospital — that means the  doctors will tend to you without delay.</li><li>Urgent comes from the Latin word urgentem, meaning ""to press hard, urge.""  You can see that urgent contains the word urge, meaning ""to demand or insist."" When you get an urgent message, you need to drop what you're doing to deal with it. An urgent need, like hunger, is a pressing one. If you're a music fan, you might know the song ""Urgent"" by the band Foreigner. The song's lyrics ""make it fast, make it urgent"" and its frenetic style help define the word.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1398,"<ul><li>A car driving into the distance, a member of a near-extinct species, or that last piece of pecan pie in the refrigerator — any of these things is likely to vanish soon, meaning ""to disappear.""</li><li>The word vanish entered English by way of French, but it can be traced back to the Latin word  evanescere, meaning to “die away” or “to dissipate.” The word covers all kinds of disappearing acts, from the  disappearance of an object or a person. You might, for example, vanish from school when the last bell rings on Friday. Things we can't see can also vanish, like the stress that vanishes when your big project is complete.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1399,"<ul><li>Anything can be a wagon, so long as it has wheels and can be pulled.  Wagons are used for transporting goods, like grains from a farm, or your little sister who wants another ride around the block.</li><li>The origin of wagon is the German weg, meaning “move, carry.”  You’ll see horse-drawn wagons carrying vegetables, or a wagon pulled by a tractor moving bales of hay into a barn.  A paddywagon is slang for a police van that brings suspected criminals to the station.  If you “fall off the wagon” that means you started drinking alcohol again after being sober for a while.  And when you “hitch your wagon to a star,” you pursue a major goal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U10_1400,"<ul><li>If you work to iron a stubborn wrinkle out of your shirt, you're trying to smooth out a crease. A wrinkle is a dent or line where that smoothness is interrupted.</li><li>You might fret about a wrinkle in your skirt or a new wrinkle on your face. Another kind of wrinkle is more figurative: a small complication or problem that arises suddenly. You could describe a torrential rain storm as a wrinkle in your plan to film a sunny scene in your movie, for example. The Old English root is gewrinclod, ""wrinkled, crooked, or winding,"" and it comes from the verb wrinclian, ""to wind.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1401,"<ul><li>Architecture is the process, or profession, of designing buildings and their environments. Architecture also refers to the product of this design and work.</li><li>The root of the word architecture is the Greek arkhitekton (""master builder""), which makes sense because the ancient Greeks were very skilled at architecture — think of all those columns and stadiums and temples. The Parthenon, which was begun in 447 BC, is one of the greatest examples of architecture from Classical Greece.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1402,"<ul><li>A basket is a container made of woven straw or other material. You might keep your dirty clothes in a plastic laundry basket.</li><li>There are many different types of baskets, from the shopping basket you carry in a grocery store to the basket you aim for when you throw a basketball. There are figurative baskets, too, like the basket you add items to when you're shopping online. What's known about the origin of basket is that it comes from the Anglo-French bascat — beyond that, it's a mystery.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1403,"<ul><li>A bloom is a flower. You might mark the beginning of spring by the very first bloom you see in your garden.</li><li>The noun bloom is useful for talking about blossoms themselves, but you can also use it as a verb meaning the process of flowering: ""Those trees seemed to bloom overnight!"" Another meaning of bloom is more figurative, meaning the peak or ideal moment for something. The bloom of your career selling Girl Scout cookies might be one sunny weekend outside the local supermarket. The origin of the word bloom is the Old Norse word blóm, ""flower or blossom.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1404,"<ul><li>A canoe is a narrow boat that you propel and steer by paddling. Most canoes are fairly light, so that one or two people can carry them easily to the water.</li><li>A canoe is wide enough for one person to sit in front of another, and pointed at both ends. Paddlers sit or kneel in the canoe and push through the water with wide, usually wooden paddles to direct their path through the water. The word canoe comes, by way of the Spanish canoa, from the Haitian language known as Carib or Arawakan, canaoua.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1405,"<ul><li>A carpet is a thick, woven floor covering. Most carpets cover the whole floor in a room, as opposed to a rug, which only covers a small section.</li><li>Carpets are made from polyester fibers, or wool, or nylon — most often, these soft materials are loops or strings that form the carpet's ""pile,"" and are attached to a solid backing. A carpet can be very densely woven and flat, or it can be tufted and thick. To carpet means to cover something as if with a carpet: ""Then the snow carpets the ground, and winter is here.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1406,"<ul><li>If Aunt Sally has a kid, that kid is your cousin, and if Aunt Sally's kid has a kid, and you have a kid too, then your kid and Sally's kid's kid are second cousins.</li><li>A cousin is a relative that's farther from you than an immediate relation like your brother or sister, usually the child of your aunt or uncle. Depending on how many children are born into your family, you might have tons of cousins you've never even met, like your distant cousin Johnny who went wild up in Alaska. We also use cousin to describe a kind of family resemblance between things, like the way barbecue sauce is the cousin of ketchup.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1407,"<ul><li>The flat-surfaced piece of furniture at which you sit and work, write, or use your computer is called a desk. Some offices have a desk for each employee.</li><li>Students often sit at classroom desks arranged in rows, and you'll also find desks in libraries, offices, and homes. Your college roommate might prefer to study while lying in bed, while you like working at your desk. Someone who has a ""desk job"" works in an office. Desk comes from the Medieval Latin desca, ""table to write on,"" which has a Greek root, diskos, ""platter or disk.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1408,"<ul><li>A gallery is an area of a building that's usually long, narrow, and has a specific function. You might visit an art gallery to check out a row of paintings hung on its walls.</li><li>There are a few kinds of galleries, but the first is a part of a house or building that's unusually long and narrow. A gallery also has some sort of purpose: in a theater, a gallery is a place where additional seats are located.  A gallery is also somewhere art is shown and sold. Art galleries can be one room of a larger place, a series of rooms, or a whole building devoted to art.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1409,"<ul><li>If you invite a friend to your home, she is your guest. You might announce to your parents that you've invited seven guests for Thanksgiving.</li><li>Someone who's visiting, or who's been asked to come, is a guest. If your next door neighbor comes over for lunch, she's a guest, and every one of the two hundred people you invite to a wedding is also a guest. You're often referred to as a guest when you stay at a hotel, too. The Old English root of guest is gæst, ""a stranger"" or ""an accidental guest.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1410,"<ul><li>If you've invited people over, offered to entertain, or let someone crash on your couch, then you're a host. Throw a fabulous party and you’ll be everyone’s favorite host. Do it when you're also hosting pneumonia germs, and your guests won't be so grateful.</li><li>The noun host refers to a person who receives and entertains guests. But hosting also has an ickier side: In biology, a host is an animal, plant or person that provides a home for another organism — like a parasite. Host also functions as a noun, meaning a multitude, horde, or great number. As in, ""You will pick up a host of funky germs from drinking the water in rural India.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U11_1412,"<ul><li>Modern means contemporary or in the now. A beehive hairdo is not so modern, though depending on the wearer, it could still be hip.</li><li>When talking about time, modern is used to mean what's happening right now. Texting your friends rather than calling them is modern. A modern building is more likely to be made out of glass and steel than bricks. In art, however, modern has a more specific meaning, as it defines a style of art produced from the 1860s to the 1970s and includes everyone from Monet to Miro. To be correct, use contemporary to mean art that is being created now.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1413,"<ul><li>A museum is a place where interesting objects are displayed — like paintings, historical documents, and dinosaur skeletons.</li><li>There are all kinds of museums. Art museums are some of the most well-known, such as the Louvre in Paris. The Natural History Museum, with its dinosaur skeletons and stuffed bears and lions, is one of New York's most famous. In Washington, DC, the Smithsonian is a group of impressive museums. Around the country, there are museums dedicated to sports, African-American culture, spies, and just about everything else. At any museum, you'll find a lot of tourists.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1414,"<ul><li>Anything pink is colored a shade that's a combination of red and white. Young girls are traditionally dolled up in pink outfits, until they eventually rebel and refuse to wear pink as tweens.</li><li>The color pink varies from a soft, pastel shade to a bold, bright one — but they're all a lighter version of red, or red with some white added. Many flowers are pink, and there are even a few known as pinks, or garden pinks. If your doctor tells you you're ""in the pink"" after your checkup, she means you're very healthy. The word began as the flower name, probably from Dutch, in which pink means ""small.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1415,"<ul><li>A plane is a vehicle that flies through the air, but it is also a tool used to make something smooth and flat, a kind of tree or a level surface. As a verb, to plane something is to make it flat and smooth.</li><li>Don't confuse plane with plain, an adjective that means ""simple"" or a noun that means ""flat land,"" like the plains of the American Midwest. This can be tricky because plane describes something that is flat and level, or the tool or action that makes something flat and level. If you remember that plain applies only to landforms, the difference will be plain to see — meaning obvious.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1416,"<ul><li>A refrigerator is a kitchen appliance where you can store your perishable food at a cool temperature. You should store your milk and meat in the refrigerator to keep them from spoiling.</li><li>The term refrigerator is often shortened to fridge, and because of this, people often mistakenly try to spell refrigerator with a d. Refrigerators come in all sizes, from a small cube that is often used in college dorm rooms by students trying to keep a six-pack of soda cool, to a huge walk-in refrigerator that might be used at a restaurant to cool all the ingredients for the week's meals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1417,"<ul><li>Temperature refers to how hot or cold something is. When you think you might have a fever, you take your temperature to see if it is higher than normal.</li><li>Temperature can also mean hotness and coldness in terms of excitement. Before offering a discount on its new one-legged jeans, the clothing manufacturer surveyed 200 loyal customers over the phone, to gauge the likely temperature of the response to their marketing ploy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1418,"<ul><li>If you are sitting in a crowd of people watching actors on a stage, you're probably in a theater. If the performance is projected on a large screen, you're in a movie theater.</li><li>The Greek word for theater (theatron) comes from the verb theasthai, meaning “behold.” You are likely to behold a play or a film inside a theater. If you've dedicated your life to theater, you are probably an actor, director or playwright. Remember when you yelled “fire!” in a crowded theater and got arrested? That wasn't funny.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1419,"<ul><li>Use the adjective upper to describe something that's the highest or top in position or rank. Your upper arm is above your lower arm, and the upper bunk on your bunkbed is closest to the ceiling.</li><li>Upper is useful for talking about anything that's located above something else. You might ski on a mountain's upper slope, taking the ski lift up as high as it goes, or become an astronaut so you can travel through the Earth's upper (or most remote) atmosphere. As a noun, an upper is the part of a shoe that's above the sole. And if you have the upper hand, it means you've got an advantage over someone else.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U11_1420,"<ul><li>A welcome is a greeting that usually comes when you first arrive. Although you aren't fond of Aunt Martha, you always manage to give her a warm welcome when she comes to visit.</li><li>When you accept someone into your home courteously, especially upon arrival, you welcome them. When you visit your grandparents, they welcome you with open arms and a plate of homemade cookies. They might even shout, ""Welcome!"" when you walk in the door. Welcome also means to gladly accept. The president of the French club will welcome your fundraising idea, especially if it involves baked goods.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1421,"<ul><li>To anticipate something is to be expecting it. Your dog might be waiting by the door, anticipating his next walk or squirrel chase.</li><li>""Anticipating something"" also often implies that you are preparing to take some action because of your expectations — like when you anticipate your chess opponent's next move and plan a counterattack. The word anticipate can also mean ""to come beforehand"" — as in a certain musical trend anticipating another.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1422,"<ul><li>A barrel is a big container used to store liquids. If you're moving a barrel, it's best to tip it on its side because its shape bulges at the center, so that it's easy to roll.</li><li>Barrels hold liquid in them — anything from wine to beer to oil. A barrel can also be the tube in a gun that a bullet travels through. You might hear the expression ""stare down the barrel of a gun,"" which means you're looking at a gun pointed right at your face.  A barrel is also used as a unit of measure or to refer to a large unit of measure. When someone says they are having ""barrels of fun,"" they're having a really great time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1423,"<ul><li>A beam is a long board that's used to hold up a roof or doorway. The beams in your kitchen ceiling help support the upstairs floor just above it.</li><li>In construction, beams are made of wood or metal and are used to frame a building and provide structure. In gymnastics, a beam is used for balancing and doing tricks on. If someone comments that you're getting ""broad in the beam,"" they're disparaging the width of your body, especially your hips. In Old English, a beam first meant a tree, and later a rafter or a ship's timber.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1424,"<ul><li>Something casual is ordinary or everyday — not too special, unusual, fancy, serious, or eventful. You might have a casual conversation with your classmates before homeroom, or attend a casual backyard barbecue.</li><li>If you're going to your friend's house for a dinner of pizza and soda, you could describe the evening as a casual night at home. Formal attire might mean tuxedos and evening gowns, but casual clothing is the kind of clothing you wear every day, for ordinary activities. If you treat a person or a subject in a casual way, you're not paying close attention or treating them as special. And you might remind your siblings to act casual on the day of your mom's surprise birthday party so that they don't ruin the surprise.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1425,"<ul><li>If you act with caution, it means you are careful. Be sure to use caution when walking across a patch of ice. Otherwise, you might end up sprawling face-first on the ground. Ouch!</li><li>The noun caution can be used to describe something that calls for careful action and the need to avoid risk, such as a volatile political situation that requires extreme caution. The word also has a verb form with a similar meaning. It’s a more formal way of saying “warn” and usually appears with against or that, as in, ""Teachers caution against waiting until the last minute to study,"" or, ""They caution that effective studying takes a long time.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1426,"<ul><li>Use contrary when two things are exactly opposite or entirely different. If something is contrary to something else, it is opposed to or against it.</li><li>A contrary child is one who opposes people in authority. As a noun, the contrary means the opposite, as in ""We will not give up; on the contrary, we will fight with all our power."" The adjective contrary derives from Latin contrarius (""opposite, opposed"") from contra (""against"").</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1427,"<ul><li>To deliberate means to carefully think or talk something through — it also means slow and measured, the pace of this kind of careful decision making. If you chose deliberately, you make a very conscious, well-thought-through choice.</li><li>The verb deliberate ends with an ""ate"" sound — at the end of a trial, after the evidence is presented, the twelve members of a jury retreat to a room to deliberate, i.e., talk through the trial and come to a verdict. The adjective deliberate ends with an ""it"" sound. If you walk with a deliberate pace, you're slow and steady.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1428,"<ul><li>To dissolve something is to break it up or weaken it, making it no longer recognizable. You could dissolve your book club or you could even dissolve a pill by dropping it into a glass of water.</li><li>You can use the verb dissolve to describe things that are coming apart or diminishing. Dissolve goes back to the Latin root dissolvere, meaning ""to loosen,"" and it came into English in the 14th century. Physical objects dissolve, as when bubbles dissolve in the tub or a cube of sugar will dissolve in hot tea, and intangible, or non-physical, things can fade away too: ""Their friendship started to dissolve when he moved across country and they communicated less frequently.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1429,"<ul><li>Anything and anyone can explode — that is, produce a violent, sudden and usually very loud release of energy.</li><li>Explode's two most common meanings refer to a physically destructive act, most commonly a bomb going off, or metaphorically, as in your parents' sudden fury when they see your end-of-year grades. Originally explode meant something quite different — to drive an unpleasing actor or group of performers from the stage by clapping and booing. (From the Latin words ex, meaning ""out,"" and plaudere, ""to clap one's hands."") Those ancient Greek and Roman crowds were tough.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1430,"<ul><li>When you fasten something, you close or attach it. You might fasten your coat, closing each snap, when the sun goes down and the air gets chilly.</li><li>People fasten all kinds of things: we all fasten our seat belts when we board an airplane and fasten our bathrobes by tying them in the front. Your ski goggles might fasten onto your helmet, just as your boots fasten onto your skis. You can also say that you fasten your hair with a barrette or fasten a charm bracelet around your wrist. The Old English root is fæstnian, ""make fast or firm.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1431,"<ul><li>A germ is a tiny life form that spreads disease. Germs are also small things that grow into larger things — whether animals, plants, or ideas.</li><li>Germ is not a technical term, but you've probably heard it used in reference to tiny organisms (such as bacteria) that cause disease. A germ is also any small structure, such as a fertilized egg, that grows into something larger. A seed that grows into a plant is a germ. In some cases, you can talk about ideas as germs. The inspiration for a book or movie can be described as the germ of the project. Germs are small, but they start big things.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1432,"<ul><li>A collection of things used for a certain purpose is a kit, like a first aid kit with bandages and aspirin, or a tool kit with hammers, screwdrivers, and wrenches.</li><li>There are kits meant for camping, taking care of your cat, and painting landscapes. A group of items needed to build or assemble something is also a kit, like a model airplane kit. The case you keep these things in can also be called a kit. A completely different sort of kit is a baby animal like a fox or beaver kit. A set of drums — bass, tom, snare and cymbals — is commonly called a ""drum kit.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1433,"<ul><li>A puff is a wisp of air or a baked snack. A magician might disappear in a puff of smoke — the kind that happens when you blow out a candle, not the kind that’s made of cheese.</li><li>A puff of wind can spin a pinwheel or send a kite bobbing higher in the sky, and a tired runner's breath comes in puffs. There’s also the kind of puff that's inflated or stuffed and soft, like a puff of hair on grandma's head, a powder puff, or puff pastry, which is a thin, buttery dough that puffs up as it's baked. The Old English root is the imitative pyffan, ""to blow with the mouth.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1434,"<ul><li>A torn bit of old fabric is a rag. You might use a rag to dust the bookshelf or scrub the bathtub, but you wouldn't want to wear one.</li><li>If your clothes are torn and dirty, they're also rags, and from the sense of ""worthless scrap,"" trashy or low quality newspapers have also long been called rags. A rag is also a somewhat annoying joke, and to rag someone is to annoy or harass them. The phrase ""from rags to riches"" describes a classic and deeply satisfying storyline: the tale of a poor person who becomes gloriously rich.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1435,"<ul><li>If you hear someone shout ""Everybody scatter!” that person wants everyone to spread out and leave the area. Scatter is a verb that means ""to separate suddenly and spread out in different directions.""</li><li>Scatter is sometimes used as a noun to refer to something that has been scattered. If you have clothes strewn all over your room, you might say there is a scatter of clothes on the floor. More commonly, though, scatter is used as a verb meaning “to spread about.” You might scatter grass seed on your front lawn in the spring. Scatter can also mean “break up or disperse.” The police, for instance, might scatter an unruly mob or gathering.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1436,"<ul><li>A scent is a smell. Every house has a particular scent that is recognizable to people as belonging to that house.</li><li>Scent comes from the Latin sentire meaning ""to feel, perceive, sense."" The word was originally used in reference to hunting dogs, who track down animals by their scent. If you ""pick up a scent,"" then you have a clue about something. If you wear a perfume, then you leave your scent in the air as you pass. Use scent instead of smell if you want to talk about a distinctively nice odor, like the scent of fresh-cut grass.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1437,"<ul><li>Steel is a kind of metal alloy that's made of iron and carbon. It's known for being incredibly strong and is often used to build the framework of skyscrapers. It's also helpful to have ""nerves of steel.""</li><li>Steel isn't just a kind of metal. A steel can also be the long, rough thing you sharpen knives on. Or if you're one of the Three Musketeers, you probably carry a steel, or a sword. People who are really brave have nerves of steel. And if you want to use steel as a verb, go right ahead: if there's something hard or unpleasant ahead, you'll need to steel yourself to get ready for it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1438,"<ul><li>If you were the first one to reach the finish line in gym class, the coach might have called you swift. Swift means quick or fast-moving. A glance, a current, even a decision can be swift.</li><li>You can use the adjective swift to describe things that move or happen rapidly and smoothly. Deciding to borrow a parent's car without permission could result in swift punishment. Foxes are so swift that if you leave the chicken coop open for a moment, one might slip in. Conversely, if innuendo sails over your head, your friends might say, “You’re not too swift on the uptake, are you?” A swift is also a small bird that looks a lot like a swallow.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1439,"<ul><li>When you lightly throw something, you toss it. You might toss your lifejacket and backpack into a canoe before climbing in with the paddles.</li><li>You can toss a baseball to your friend in the backyard, or toss your trash in a wastebasket when you're finished with lunch. You can also toss a coin or toss a salad. Another way to toss is to move back and forth — or thrash — like an insomniac in bed or a boat on a stormy ocean.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U12_1440,"<ul><li>A triumph is a well-earned victory. It'll make you pump your fist and yell ""Hurrah!""</li><li>Triumph can be a noun or a verb, so you can have a triumph after the big game when you triumph over your opponents. Either way, it's a way to rejoice and a reason to whoop it up. The word comes from the Latin triumphus which is an ""achievement, success, procession for a victorious general or admiral.""  The jury's still out on whether it comes from the Greek thriambos, as a ""hymn to Dionysus,"" but it's fun to imagine that a triumph is a song to the Greek god of party animals. Fittingly, a Triumph is also the name of a motorcycle, a cool car, and a hard rockin' band from Canada.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1441,"<ul><li>The adverb aboard means on board, as in on a ship, train or plane. Usually the captain will welcome you aboard with a brief speech if you're lucky — or a long one if you're not.</li><li>Aboard comes from the French phrase à bord, which has the same meaning as the English word — on board. If you were just hired, your new manager might say ""Welcome aboard"" (the figurative company train). The phrase ""All aboard!"" is said as a warning before departure, especially before a ship or train leaves. It means, in essence: haul your keister up here quick or you'll be left behind!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1442,"<ul><li>If you usually drink your coffee with lots of cream and sugar in it, you might be surprised at how bitter plain black coffee can taste. Bitter means ""having a sharp or harsh flavor.""</li><li>Bitter describes a particular pungent taste, like the sharpness of very dark chocolate (which is sometimes called bittersweet for its mixture of the two flavors). If you imagine taking that bitter taste on your tongue and turning it into an emotion, you've got another meaning of bitter: a resentful, angry feeling. And if you turn that bitter flavor into a physical feeling, you've got an adjective that describes a sharp, unpleasant sensation, like a cold, bitter wind.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1443,"<ul><li>A bullet is the metal object that is fired out of a gun when its trigger is pulled. Without bullets, a gun is harmless.</li><li>If someone talks about ammunition for a gun, they're talking about bullets. A bullet doesn't usually contain explosives but does its damage by penetrating whatever — or whomever — it hits. The Middle French source of bullet is boulette, ""cannonball"" or ""small ball,"" from boule, ""a ball,"" with its Latin root bulla, ""round thing."" To ""bite the bullet"" means to withstand an unpleasant but necessary situation, from the (possibly fictitious) practice of patients biting bullets during painful operations.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1444,"<ul><li>A devil is profoundly bad spirit, being, or monster. Your religious uncle might blame all bad behavior on the influence of the devil.</li><li>In Christianity, the devil (which is sometimes capitalized), is the essence of evil, also known as Satan. The word is also used to mean a very hateful or cruel human: ""He must be a devil, to hurt a kitten like that,"" or sometimes a mischievous trickster: ""What a little devil she is, always playing practical jokes."" When you devil someone, you annoy or bother them: ""We loved to devil the cranky old man next door.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1445,"<ul><li>If you get my drift, you get the basic meaning of what I'm saying. Or, if you move around without a seeming fixed destination, you are said to drift — whether you're a snowflake or just a wanderer.</li><li>Interestingly, the verb to drift can be used either approvingly or disapprovingly. We rather admire the freedom of certain objects that drift, such as snow drifts or drift wood, but applied to people we're a bit more critical: we tend to harbor suspicions of the carefree Gypsy or nomad, hence the moral criticism (and danger) inherent in the term drifters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1446,"<ul><li>To enforce means to make sure the laws and rules are being followed. So those guys wearing striped outfits and whistles? They're in charge of enforcing the rules of the game.</li><li>See the word force inside of enforce? It can help you remember that enforce is all about forcing others to follow the rules. The traffic police enforce the driving laws by handing out speeding tickets. Your parents hopefully enforce good behavior by grounding you when you stay out too late. It would be wonderful if everyone just followed the rules on their own, but it seems the temptation to be bad is just too strong. So thank goodness for all the enforcers that keep us in line.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1447,"<ul><li>A fountain is a decorative structure that shoots streams of water into the air. You might see a big fountain in front of a museum, or install a small one in your back yard.</li><li>You can use the noun fountain any time you talk about a shooting flow of water, whether it's a deliberate, artificial piece of architecture or an accidental fountain caused by the faucet in your kitchen sink breaking suddenly, sending a fountain of water into the air. The earliest, fifteenth century meaning of fountain was ""spring of water that collects in a pool,"" from the Latin root word fons, ""spring of water.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1448,"<ul><li>A harbor is a safe place providing refuge and comfort. If you're traveling, the harbor provided by a warm hotel is welcome. For ships, a harbor is a sheltered port area shielded from waves, where it's safe to dock.</li><li>Harbor can also be used as a verb, which describes maintaining a belief or a feeling. If you harbor ill-will toward your neighbor John, you don't like him much. Harbor can also mean you hold back your ideas and don't express them openly. John may have no idea you hate him if you harbor your true feelings deep inside, but pretend you like him to his face.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1449,"<ul><li>When you inhabit a place, you live there. When actors inhabit their roles, they seem to become the characters, no longer actors reciting their lines. It is like they live the life of the character.</li><li>The verb inhabit comes from the Old French enhabiter, meaning “dwell in.” You can inhabit an actual place, like a home, a cave, or a neighborhood. You can also inhabit an imaginary world, like those who choose to inhabit cyberspace with a made-up persona, telling about experiences that are nothing like the person's real life. Actors who truly inhabit their roles sometimes struggle to return to reality after a movie or television show wraps.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1450,"<ul><li>To march is to walk with deliberate, short steps that fall in a regular rhythm. You can take your time walking into school in the morning, or you can march right up the steps and through the door.</li><li>People can march just about anywhere they walk, although the verb brings to mind military processions of soldiers who march in unison. Marching bands are another example of people who march together this way. You can also use the word when you're talking about a group of demonstrators who decide to march in protest or support of a particular cause. March comes from the Middle French word marcher, which originally meant ""to trample,"" and later came to mean ""to walk.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1451,"<ul><li>A millionaire is someone who has at least a million dollars. If you're a millionaire, you are incredibly wealthy — but not as rich as a billionaire.</li><li>In U.S., if you have a million dollars — or things that are worth that much, like a million-dollar house — you're a millionaire. In the U.K., a millionaire has a million pounds. This word describes a specific amount of wealth, but it's also a metaphor for ""rich,"" so you might say, ""My neighbors are millionaires — they travel to foreign countries all the time!"" The first American millionaire was John Jacob Astor, who earned his riches from 18th-century fur trading.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1452,"<ul><li>A port is a place where boats come and go.  If you think that docks and harbors are romantic, I suggest you move to a port city like Baltimore.</li><li>Just as seaports and airports link countries together by enabling trade and travel, a device that links computers together is also called a port.  Port comes from the Latin word portus, meaning ""haven"" or ""harbor.""  You can hear this sense of a port as a place of safe arrival in the proverb ""any port in a storm."" On a ship, the port side is the left side. Port is also a verb, meaning ""to carry.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1453,"<ul><li>A sheriff is the top-ranking officer in a county police force. Unlike police in a city or town, the sheriff is an elected official.</li><li>In most states, the sheriff serves a four-year term, and she oversees a department of police officers. A sheriff's job varies from state to state, but it generally includes enforcing the law, making arrests within the county, traffic control, prisoner transportation, and crime investigation. The Old English root word is scirgerefa, ""representative of royal authority in a shire."" Sheriff has been used in the United States since the 1600's.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1454,"<ul><li>To startle is to jump, like when you're surprised. If you’re sneaking through a dark room and step on a sleeping dog’s tail — you might startle  the dog. If she barks, that dog startles you right back!</li><li>A startle is a quick, sharp movement, like a little jump that happens when you’re surprised or suddenly scared. If you sneak up on your mom and say ""Boo!"" you’ll startle her and she might jump up in her seat (before she yells at you to quit it). Alarm clocks and barking dogs often startle people. The original meaning of startle, around 1300, was ""to run back and forth,"" from the Old English word styrtan, ""to leap up.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1455,"<ul><li>Sweat is perspiration that makes you feel cooler when it evaporates off the surface of your skin — or the giving-off of this liquid. If you exercise hard, you will sweat.</li><li>The word sweat comes from the Old English word swætan, which means “perspire,” and “work hard.” Though sweat is the body's way of cooling itself, today it also means ""to worry or be stressed out."" If someone tells you not to sweat it, it means ""don't worry."" But if someone is ""sweating"" you, it means you are hassled, maybe being asked every five minutes, ""Did you finish your work yet?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1456,"<ul><li>A trigger is a metal lever that when pulled discharges a gun. You shoot the gun by pulling the trigger. Trigger can also mean the start of a process––violent protests might trigger a revolution.</li><li>Certain scents, places, or old love songs can be said to trigger, or activate, memories. If you get weepy when you hear the national anthem, that may be because it triggers thoughts of family, home, baseball and the Fourth of July. For someone in frail health, a seemingly minor problem like getting a common cold, might trigger a series of physical responses that end up landing them in the hospital.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1457,"<ul><li>When you bring together unlike elements, you unify them. Political movements can unify people by inspiring them to work towards a shared goal. Likewise, a shared love of a team or band can unify people who otherwise don't have much in common.</li><li>The verb unify comes from the Latin prefix uni-, “one,” and the root facere, “to make.” When you unify things, you make them one. Often squabbling people just need someone to point out their similarities in order to unify them. If your classmates are sabotaging each other to try to win the “best-decorated locker” award, you might be able to unify their efforts suggesting a “most awesome class” award instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1458,"<ul><li>What do a canoe, a soda can, and your arteries have in common? Each one is a type of vessel. A vessel can be a ship, a container for holding liquids, or a tube that transports blood throughout your body.</li><li>Vessel has a number of different meanings, yet all of them relate in some way to liquids and transportation. This relationship in meaning has existed in language for a long time; the word vessel comes from the Latin word, vascellum, which also means both “vase” and “ship.” The use of the word vessel in reference to “blood vessels” came about in English during the 14th century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1459,"<ul><li>If someone tells you ""bon voyage!"" they mean have a good trip. Voyage means trip in French but in English, we use it to mean a long journey.</li><li>Though voyage is usually used literally to mean a long and exciting journey or a trip that involves sailing such as a cruise, it can be used figuratively as well. Researching your family tree might become a voyage of self-discovery, taking you places you don't expect and teaching you more about yourself than you thought possible.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U13_1460,"<ul><li>To worship is to show a lot of love and adoration for something. Religious believers worship gods, and people can worship other people and things too.</li><li>Worship is an extreme form of love — it's a type of unquestioning devotion. If you worship God, then you love God so much that you don't question him at all. Going to church is a form of worship — so is prayer. People also use the word worship in other cases. If you love a musician or sports star, you might say, ""I worship her!"" Or someone might say to you, ""Man, you need to wake up and stop worshiping him.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1461,"<ul><li>An apprentice is someone who learns a trade. An apprentice farmer is paid very little but has the chance to learn farming by watching and doing.</li><li>In the old days, becoming an apprentice was the only way to get into many lines of work. Nowadays we think of it more in terms of trades — butchers, bakers, bricklayers, etc. If you do the same thing in an office setting, it's usually called an internship, but the idea is the same — learning by watching an expert. The word can be used as either a noun or verb: You are an apprentice, but you also can apprentice to the barber down the street.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1462,"<ul><li>If you assure your boss that you’ll finish your project by Tuesday, you are make a promise or commitment to have it done by Tuesday.</li><li>The verbs insure and ensure look and sound like assure but they aren't synonyms. There is some overlap in meaning — all of them can mean “to make secure or certain” — but assure is generally used in situations when you are referring to a person: “I assure you that I haven’t forgotten about driving you to the airport” or “He called his mother to assure her that everything will be fine.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1463,"<ul><li>A bandage is a piece of tape or cloth that's used to slow the flow of blood from a cut or another wound. Any good first aid kit is equipped with plenty of bandages.</li><li>A bandage can vary from being a tiny plastic strip you stick on the spot where your cat scratched you to a thick, wide cloth that's applied to a serious injury at a hospital. You can also use it as a verb: ""If I were you, I'd bandage that skinned knee so it doesn't get dirty."" Bandage is a Middle French word, from the Old French bander, ""to bind,"" and ultimately bande, ""a strip.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1464,"<ul><li>When you bleed, blood runs or oozes out of your body. Cutting your finger when you're chopping vegetables can make you bleed.</li><li>Some kind of illness or injury, particularly one that cuts or scrapes your skin, can make you bleed. In long ago days of medical care, doctors would deliberately bleed patients to treat specific conditions, though today we mainly bleed due to accidents. You can also use bleed to mean ""drain of money or resources,"" as when a greedy relative bleeds his wealthy grandmother, using her fortune to buy himself fancy cars.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1465,"<ul><li>You and your best friend have a bond that allows you to trust each other with all your thoughts and secrets. A bond is a connection between two things.</li><li>Bond can refer to a physical or emotional restraint as in a prisoner who might tear off his bonds and escape to freedom. If you are arrested, your parents will have to pay a bond to get you released from jail. If you don't show up to court, they will lose that money. A certificate of debt issued by a government or corporation is also called a bond. When you cash in the bond on a set date, you get your money back plus interest. In its meaning of ""connection,"" bond can be used as a verb. Have you ever met someone and felt an instant connection? You can say that you bonded.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1466,"<ul><li>Someone whose job is cooking food and planning menus at a restaurant is a chef. Many chefs graduate from cooking school, while others learn cooking techniques by observing and working with experienced chefs..</li><li>The word chef often specifies someone who cooks fancy or expensive food — in contrast, you might call a man who fries burgers at a fast food place or a woman who makes grilled cheese sandwiches at a diner simply cooks. The chef is generally at the top of the food chain in a restaurant kitchen, the boss of the other workers. Chef is French, short for chef de cuisine, or ""head of the kitchen.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1467,"<ul><li>A crown is a fancy, round ornament worn on the heads of kings and queens. To crown someone is to declare them a monarch or a champion. A crown is also a boring old top of something, like a tooth.</li><li>Historically, a crown represented the country ruled by the monarch who wore it. In some cases, the person wearing a crown wasn't the king, but the head of a church, as most modern-day Catholic popes have done during certain ceremonies. Other kinds of crowns are the top of a hat or the top part of your head, and also the visible part of a tooth — or the artificial replacement made by a dentist.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1468,"<ul><li>A departure is the act of leaving somewhere. Think about an airport that has departure gates for outgoing passengers and an arrival area for people flying in.</li><li>Since departing means to leave, a departure is an act of leaving. There are many type of departures, such as when you go to the store or take a flight. A departure can be a metaphor too, as in a departure from the norm, like if a TV cop show suddenly turns into a vampire show. If a comedian starts being serious, that's a departure too. This word is also a euphemism for death, as in ""a departure from life.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1469,"<ul><li>Someone who is diligent works hard and carefully. If you want to write the epic history of your family, you'll have to be very diligent in tracking down and interviewing all of your relatives.</li><li>Diligent comes from the Latin diligere, which means ""to value highly, take delight in,"" but in English it has always meant careful and hard-working. If you're a diligent worker, you don't just bang away at your job; you earnestly try to do everything right. Although being lucky and talented doesn't hurt, it's the diligent person who eventually succeeds.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1470,"<ul><li>Forget prime ministers, presidents or even kings or queens: an emperor was the biggest, baddest ruler of them all — the leader of undisputed power who controlled a nation or, more usually, a number of subjugated nations known collectively as an empire.</li><li>Nowadays the emperor is no more, replaced by humbler and usually more democratic leaders, but the notion of an all-conquering larger-than-life figure lives on in the way we give the prefix emperor to particularly magnificent specimens of living things: the Emperor Butterfly, Emperor Moth and Emperor Penguin, most famously. The Roman emperors would be proud.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1471,"<ul><li>Almost all fabrics, muscle structures, and even vegetables are composed of some sort of fiber, the noun meaning a long, thread-like substance.</li><li>The word fiber is sometimes associated with moral character in a similar way that it is related to the physical material. The moral fiber of a person might be the thing that weaves together their character to make them the ethical (or unethical) person they are. For example, you might guess that the televangelist who asks for money from the elderly poor, but has a fancy sports car for every day of the week lacks moral fiber.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1472,"<ul><li>The difference between bad and horrible is like the difference between an unpleasant dream and an awful nightmare.</li><li>Horrible means ""causing horror,"" and goes back to the Latin word for “tremble” or “shudder.”  A horrible thing makes you shake with fear, like a story about an atrocious crime.  We also use horrible hyperbolically (which means in an over-the-top way) to criticize things. You might think you look horrible in photos, or that a new TV reality show is horrible. Do you ever wonder if something horrible is hiding in your closet?  I mean, besides your plaid suit?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1473,"<ul><li>If you're impolite, you have terrible manners: you're rude. Small children whose parents teach them not to be impolite learn early to say ""please"" and ""thank you.""</li><li>Acting disrespectful or ungracious is impolite, like when your impolite sister helps herself to the birthday cake you just made for your dad, or pushes in front of other people in line for a movie. The opposite of impolite is polite, which comes from the Latin word politus, figuratively meaning ""refined or elegant,"" and literally, ""polished."" When you add the im-, you get the sense of ""not"" or ""the opposite of.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1474,"<ul><li>When you kneel, you rest your bent knees on the ground. People kneel to pray, to work in the garden, and to do yoga.</li><li>Kids often kneel on the living room rug to play, and adults kneel to tie a child's shoelaces, to vacuum under the sofa, to play with a puppy, to exercise, and for many other reasons. A great thing about the word kneel is that its meaning is easy to see — the word knee is obvious when you look at it. The Old English root word, cnēowlian, simply means kneel, and it comes from cnēow, or ""knee.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1475,"<ul><li>A luxury is something that is pleasant to have or experience, but it is not necessary. For example, eating in a restaurant is a luxury — you can always cook and eat at home.</li><li>In its earliest days, luxury meant ""excess that is sinfully self-indulgent."" Over time, this definition softened, losing the air of judgment, but retaining the sense that a luxury is enjoyable or comfortable, but not necessary. We often think of a luxury as something costly, but this isn't always so. For example, being able to sleep late or live within walking distance of loved ones or a beautiful forest can also be luxuries.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1476,"<ul><li>Massive means enormous. Obviously, Mt. Everest is massive, but a massive budget cut isn't necessarily big in physical mass; it's something that is imposing in scale or power. A massive budget cut can do a lot of damage.</li><li>Unless someone is referring to your intellect, massive is not a word you want used in a description of your attributes. Massive is a nice one to trot out when huge, gigantic, and enormous sound too over-the-top.  Politicians use it often. Massive could also be the best way to describe the wave you surfed on your Hawaiian vacation or the size of the fish you nearly caught on that trip with your friends.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1477,"<ul><li>To panic is to become filled with fear and anxiety. Someone in a panic is totally freaking out.</li><li>Have you ever heard someone say ""Don't panic""? That's easier said than done. People panic when they lose control over themselves because of fear, stress, or danger. A pilot who runs into turbulence and then flees from the cockpit has panicked. A surgeon who makes a mistake might panic for a second, before chilling out and helping the patient. It's hard to do a good job when you panic. Panicking is pretty much the opposite of relaxing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1478,"<ul><li>When a group or a person cares about one thing over all others, that’s the top priority. “After the flood, finding a place to live became their first priority.”</li><li>Priority comes from the word prior, which means to come before something else.  A priority is the concern, interest or desire that comes before all others. “His first priority was to establish his career and get married later.”  “When seeking the perfect wave, Jeff and Wayne made it their priority to be the first surfers on the beach.” ""The new CEO's top priority was firing her predecessor's hires.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1479,"<ul><li>A robe is a loose piece of clothing that you might wear over your pajamas or put on when you get out of the shower. Most robes tie around the waist with a fabric belt.</li><li>There are dressier types of robes as well, like the ceremonial robes a judge wears in a courtroom or the elegant robes worn by a queen on a formal occasion. You can also use robe a verb, meaning ""to dress or clothe,"" or literally ""to put on a robe."" Robe shares a Germanic root with rob, most likely from the idea that robbers would ""take garments from the enemy as spoils or booty.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U14_1480,"<ul><li>When you scold someone, you (often angrily) point out and criticize some fault or error. If you forget again to clean up your room, your mom might scold you for it.</li><li>Scold can also be used as a noun to describe a person who irritates people by finding fault in everything. Your great aunt Merna, who during the holidays complains about her gifts, criticizes your weight, says the turkey is too dry, and the stuffing is soggy? She's a scold. Maybe she's cranky. Which brings us to the other way we can use scold as a verb: to grumble, grouch, or generally express one's crankiness. This latter meaning has more to do with the attitude of the scolder than the faults of the one being scolded.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1481,"<ul><li>If your grandfather was so startled by people shouting ""Surprise!"" at his birthday party that he had a mild heart attack, you'd probably want to just forget the whole affair. An affair is a specific event.</li><li>You can use affair as a kind of shorthand, to mean ""that big mess,"" or ""that complicated story I already told you about."" Your affair can also mean your responsibility or job, like if your grandmother said, ""I don't care about balloons for the party — that's your affair."" Another way affair is frequently used is to mean a love affair, particularly if the relationship is brief and intense. This meaning comes from the French phrase affaire de coeur, ""affair of the heart.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1482,"<ul><li>Use the noun assembly to refer group of people meeting up for a mutual purpose, such as a church service.</li><li>Often used to describing a gathering of people, the word assembly can also refer to putting something together, such as a machine or a piece of furniture. No matter if the individual components are people or objects, assembly implies a bringing together. You may be familiar with the term ""freedom of assembly,"" which is considered a basic human right. It means that people are free to peacefully gather together to protest the government, to worship, to hold a public meeting . . . or even to play poker. This allows people to exchange information and pursue mutual goals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1483,"<ul><li>To bless is to offer a holy seal of approval, like when a priest blesses water, making holy water. It’s also what people say when you sneeze: bless you, which is short for “may God bless you.”</li><li>If you go back far enough, the word bless is related to the word blood, because of the blood sprinkled on pagan alters. It moved on to mean “to praise,” and now it’s a little of both (minus the pagans). In religious contexts, things are made holy when they're blessed. Also, people are blessed by good things that happen. People often say things like ""I've been blessed with good health.” That means they were lucky to receive such good things.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1484,"<ul><li>Cereal is a grassy grain used for food, like corn or wheat. But if someone offers you a bowl of cereal, don’t expect a pile of grass. Cereal is also a popular breakfast food served in a bowl with milk.</li><li>You can use the word cereal when you talk about a grain crop, the harvested grain, or the prepared breakfast food. Oatmeal is a hot cereal, and Cheerios is a cold one. Originally, cereal meant ""having to do with edible grain,"" from the Latin Cerealis, ""of grain,"" but also ""of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture."" Next time you enjoy a bowl of Fruit Loops, make sure to thank Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1485,"<ul><li>Someone who's cheerful is spirited and happy. Your sister might be so cheerful that you hear her whistling joyfully first thing in the morning.</li><li>If you're full of good humor and optimism, your friends probably describe you as cheerful. A cheerful bus driver, restaurant server, or calculus teacher can brighten your whole day. Cheerful means ""full of cheer,"" and cheer, which came to mean ""good mood or spirit,"" started out in the 13th century meaning ""the face,"" from the Late Latin cara, ""face,"" and its Greek root, kara, ""head.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1486,"<ul><li>It's good to know where the diameter of a circular object is if you have to split a cookie between two 5-year-old kids. Think of a round chocolate chip cookie. The diameter of the cookie is a line that divides the cookie into two equal halves, through the center of the cookie.</li><li>The diameter of a circle or sphere is a line that passes through the center and starts and ends and two opposite points on its perimeter or edge. The diameter is also the length of that line. In math class, teachers often ask you to use the diameter of a circle to find its area. This is a good skill to have if you are trying to figure out whether the 14 inch or 16 inch pizza is a better deal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1487,"<ul><li>An exploit is a heroic act or notable deed. The King Arthur legends are full of stories of the exploits of the Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Lancelot and King Arthur himself.</li><li>This noun is from Middle English expleit, ""outcome,"" from Latin explicitus, ""unfolded, set forth."" The verb exploit means to use someone or something, usually selfishly or for profit. Workers who are tired of being exploited by factory owners form unions that allow them to stand together as a powerful force.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1488,"<ul><li>A famine is a severe shortage of food, but not the ""I forgot to go to the grocery store and there's nothing to eat in the house"" type of shortage. A famine is usually caused by crop failure or disaster.</li><li>Although the ""extreme shortage of food"" meaning is most common, the noun famine can also mean any shortage or insufficiency, and it is often used idiomatically in the phrase ""feast or famine."" This usage refers to something that is alternately plentiful and scarce — like the feast and famine experienced by an artist who only occasionally sells his paintings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1489,"<ul><li>The harvest is the time when you reap what you sow. As a verb, to harvest something means that you pick or gather it. You might harvest your sweet corn late in the summer.</li><li>As a noun, harvest means the time of year when crops are ripe and ready to be gathered. The picked crop is also called a harvest: a bumper crop is a plentiful harvest, and a poor harvest is when things didn’t grow as well as expected. As a verb, to harvest something is to gather, trap, or cull it. You can harvest a soybean crop, you can harvest beaver pelts, or you can harvest tissues or organs for transplants.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1490,"<ul><li>To be merry is to be happy, especially in a fun, festive way. Parties and celebrations are merry, and so are the fun people who attend them. This old fashioned word for “happy” is popular in December when people say, “Merry Christmas.”</li><li>To be merry is to be happy, jaunty, and ready to frolic. A group of people laughing as they walk down the street is a merry gang. Anything merry is festive, often involving games, celebrations, and parties. A merry-go-round makes kids happy as it spins them around. Smiling and laughing are signs of being merry. If you go along your merry way, you walk away happily, maybe even skipping.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U15_1492,"<ul><li>If you belch, interrupt a conversation, or leave the table during dinner, you’re expected to say “Pardon me.” Once you’ve requested your companions’ pardon, or forgiveness, you can assume you have it; you don’t need to wait for their response.</li><li>The word pardon often occurs in the phrases “Pardon me” and “I beg your pardon.” (While “I beg your pardon” literally means “I request your forgiveness,” it’s used to indicate that the speaker did not hear what was just said.) Outside of these everyday phrases, pardon is typically used in formal or legal situations. If the president pardons a criminal, for example, the criminal is forgiven in the sense that he or she no longer has to serve the penalty for the crime.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U15_1494,"<ul><li>When a fruit is ripe, it is time to pick it and eat it. If you say the time is ripe, then now is the time for action. Ripe means ready.</li><li>Ripe can also describe something that is not only ready to happen but well-suited for whatever is happening. A company can expect profits if the market is ripe for its product. When a ballpark has a short field, batters will say that the field is ripe for home runs. When things are ripe, it's a good thing — the time for action is now.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1495,"<ul><li>Roast a turkey by cooking it in the oven. Roast a friend by calling her a turkey on her birthday. To roast can mean to cook, or to poke fun of someone as a way of honoring them.</li><li>In cooking, slow, dry heat is used to roast things. When a cook roasts a piece of meat, you can call the meat itself a roast too. Another way to use this word is to mean “to make fun of someone,” like a toast but meaner and funnier. Comedians are known to roast each other, telling one joke after another mocking the person they're celebrating. This comes from an eighteenth century use of roast to mean ""an unmerciful bantering.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1496,"<ul><li>A routine is like a habit or sequence that doesn't vary. There are daily routines and dance routines, and maybe even daily dance routines.</li><li>Something routine isn't unusual: routine things happen all the time. Most jobs have a routine — things that must be done on a regular basis. People often get surprised by things that aren't part of their routine, or ""shake up their routine."" Computer routines are predetermined and predictable. Singers and dancers also have routines — the planned performances they've (hopefully) been practicing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1497,"<ul><li>A scheme is an elaborate plan or plot. It's going to take a really solid scheme, probably involving teleportation or some sort of temporary cloning, to make an appearance at both parties at once.</li><li>Scheme comes to us from the Latin word for ""figure."" And it's still used today to refer to a set of drawings and figures used to map out something. Or maybe you’ve heard people talk about something in the scheme of life."" In that case they're talking about something that fits into the bigger picture. But don't forget that schemes often carry a negative connotation — the word brings to mind devious plans and secret plots organized by scheming bad guys.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1498,"<ul><li>Anything slim is thin or narrow. So, your sister may be considered slim, and you could also have ""a slim chance"" of winning the lottery.</li><li>Slim people are slender, and slim things are usually delicate, like a slim watch band. You can also use slim to describe a margin or a chance: ""There was only a slim likelihood that the home team would win this game."" Back in the early 1800s, to slim meant ""to do one's work carelessly,"" and in the seventeenth century, the adjective was also used to mean ""sly or crafty.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1499,"<ul><li>A stove is a machine that heats or cooks. If you want really delicious popcorn, don't use the microwave — cook it the old-fashioned way, in a pot of hot oil on the stove.</li><li>Stoves typically use gas or electricity. If you have a wood-burning stove in your house, you know it's an apparatus that burns split logs to create enough heat to warm up a room — or several rooms. In the 15th century, stove meant either ""heated room"" or ""bathroom."" Experts aren't sure about the word's origin, although some guess a connection to Vulgar Latin's extufare, ""take a steam bath.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U15_1500,"<ul><li>Theft is the act of stealing something. If you've ever taken your sister's sweater without asking her first, then she's right: that's an instance of theft!</li><li>The word theft refers to taking something from someone else without getting permission. Shoplifting is a form of theft, as is embezzling a million dollars from your business partner's Swiss bank account. In the United States, petty theft is the act of stealing anything worth less than $500, like someone's bike or a pack of gum. It's still a punishable crime, but you will get in much bigger trouble if you steal something more valuable, like a car.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1501,"<ul><li>Adolescent is just a fancy word for teenager — someone who is no longer a child but is not yet an adult. The word can also be used as an adjective. For example, a particular clothing line might be geared toward adolescent girls.</li><li>This word refers to all things related to teens — teenagers are adolescent, and the adolescent stage is after puberty and before adulthood. Since adults don't have a high opinion of teenagers, this word is also an insult. Movies full of fart jokes and immature shenanigans are called adolescent. If one adult says to another ""You're acting very adolescent"" that means ""You're acting childish."" Adolescent means something close to juvenile, another word that refers to young people and childish people.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1502,"<ul><li>An aptitude is something you're good at. A rock star might have an aptitude for energizing an audience, or for trashing his hotel room.</li><li>When you have a talent or do something well, people say that you have an aptitude for it. But you don't have to be born with an aptitude; you can also acquire your abilities. You are probably already well acquainted with this word, since the zillions of standardized tests you have taken in school are usually called aptitude tests.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1503,"<ul><li>A compliment is an expression of respect or admiration, like, ""You're such a good writer,"" or ""You know so many words!"" Keep them coming.</li><li>Compliments are always welcome, because they usually make people feel good. It’s saying something nice about someone or something. If you get mysterious flowers, look at the card – perhaps it will say “compliments of your upstairs neighbors,” as an apology for playing their music too loud all night. Or if you say, “my compliments to the chef!” you really liked your meal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1504,"<ul><li>The verb hinder means to block or put something in the way of, so if you’re in a high-speed car chase with the police, they might put up a blockade to hinder your progress.</li><li>The word hinder came from the Old English hindrian, which means to  ""injure or damage."" That's a little more extreme than what it means today, because, now it just means to get in the way of something or someone. People might not like you too much if you make it a practice to hinder their progress or get in the way of things they want, even if it's a small hindrance like blocking someone from getting to the cookie jar.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1505,"<ul><li>If your dream job includes writing for a newspaper or interviewing famous people for a magazine, you hope to someday work in the field of journalism.</li><li>Working for a radio or TV news show, a magazine, a newspaper, or a news-related website would all be considered journalism. Those jobs might include reporting, writing, editing, photography, or documentary film making. An individual newspaper or magazine is sometimes called a ""journal,"" and the category of these publications is also called journalism. The first newspaper ever published was a German journal printed in Strassburg in 1605, called ""Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1506,"<ul><li>A jury is a group that decides a contest or a court case together. If you get summoned for jury duty and get picked as one of the 12 members of the jury, you’ll help decide if someone is guilty or not.</li><li>A jury is any group that makes a group decision. In the County Fair, the stakes aren't so high — just respect for your baking skills or pig-raising talents. But many juries are convened by courts to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty. In this case, the jury is sworn to act according to the law. Jury comes from the Old French word for ""oath,"" pointing to the promise to deliver the truth that a jury swears to.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1507,"<ul><li>Justice is the quality of being just or fair. Super heroes fight for justice because they want everything to be fair and not let bad guys win. Just ask Wonder Woman, Superman, or any other member of the Justice League.</li><li>Justice is usually associated with the law. A judge is also known as a justice, and the point of the law is to keep everything in a society fair according to society’s rules. Justice (capital “J”) is also the statue of a blindfolded woman holding scales and a sword. If something is brought to justice, the good guys have been rewarded and the bad guys punished — the scales are even.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1508,"<ul><li>Liberty is a kind of freedom, whether it's freedom from tyranny, freedom from confinement, or simply the freedom of choice.</li><li>The phrase ""give me liberty or give me death"" is attributed to Patrick Henry, whose 1775 speech persuaded the Virginia colony to raise troops to fight the British in the American Revolutionary War. For sailors and naval officers, liberty means shore leave — a brief vacation on land between voyages. We also use this noun to describe the act of getting a little too familiar or personal with someone, or doing something before we have their approval or permission.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1509,"<ul><li>Use literary when you want to indicate writing with high artistic qualities.  Something doesn't have to be ""literature"" to be literary, but they are related.</li><li>Literary comes from the Latin litterarius, meaning ""letters,"" as in letters of the alphabet.     Think of literary writing as writing that explores the richness of language or even contributes to it, especially in a high cultural way. The clever rhymes you invented about your grade school principal's bathing habits made your classmates laugh, but that doesn't make them great literary achievements.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1510,"<ul><li>A pharmacy is where you go when you need to fill a prescription for medicine. Hospitals have pharmacies, but you can also find retail pharmacies in most cities and towns.</li><li>The technique of making medicine and dispensing it is also known as pharmacy, and people who practice this kind of science are pharmacists. If your doctor diagnoses an infection, it's your friendly neighborhood pharmacist who measures your antibiotics, packages them for you, and instructs you on how much and how often to take them. The Greek root is pharmakeia, which means ""medicines or cure,"" but also ""witchcraft, spells, or potions.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1511,"<ul><li>A small, round dose of medicine is a pill. If you get sick, you might take a pill, which is a pain because it usually tastes bad. A person who’s a pain can also be called a pill.</li><li>In addition to medicine, you can take vitamins or other supplements in the form of a pill. Most pills have to be swallowed whole with water, but some can be chewed. Because of the association of pill with yucky medicine, there's also the colloquial meaning of ""unpleasant person,"" like a little brother who's a total pill. And from the same association comes ""a bitter pill to swallow,"" for ""a difficult or painful necessity.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1512,"<ul><li>If you presume something, it means you act as though it's true before all the evidence is in. If you are presumed to be the fastest runner, don't get too cocky — that word implies that you haven't actually raced yet.</li><li>To presume is to take something for granted. The famous quote “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” comes from the explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who ran into the explorer David Livingstone in the wilds of Africa in 1871. It’s funny because these were the only two white men known to be in that part of Africa at the time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1513,"<ul><li>When you're away from the prying eyes of others, you have privacy — you're alone, secluded, and not in the public eye.</li><li>Sometimes you just don't want to be bothered by anyone, so you seek a place where you can be alone with your thoughts, free from distractions or intrusions. When that's the case, you are seeking privacy: private space and time away from others. Privacy has always been an issue for celebrities, who are followed around by photographers. If you value your privacy, don't run for office: politicians give up their privacy when they run for election.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1514,"<ul><li>Punishment is the penalty you have to pay when you're caught doing something bad. A teenager's punishment for missing her curfew might be helping her dad clean the garage.</li><li>When someone is officially penalized for a mistake or a crime, that's punishment. Stealing a car could result in a punishment involving jail, while pinching your little sister might mean a punishment as mild as sitting in a chair and thinking about ways to be nicer next time. The Latin root of punishment and its related verb, punish, is punire, ""punish, correct, take vengeance for, or cause pain for some offense.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1515,"<ul><li>Sensible means practical and reasonable. If you're wearing sensible shoes, they're sturdy, comfortable, good for walking, and your feet don't hurt. If you're a sensible person, you're level-headed and calm, and you make wise decisions.</li><li>Sensible may not sound exciting — who wants to be like a pair of galoshes, when you can be stilettos? But sensible is the voice of reason, and when you're tooling along in your convertible, you'll be grateful for the sensible 15-mile-per-hour speed limit posted at that sharp turn where the road drops off into the canyon. Sensible comes from the Latin sensibilis, meaning ""perceptible by the senses,"" a meaning that eventually evolved into ""having good sense, reasonable.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1516,"<ul><li>A slice is a narrow piece or portion of something (particularly food), like a slice of bread or a slice of pizza.</li><li>You can order a slice of cake or pie at your favorite bakery, or fry potatoes after cutting them into thin slices. Slice can also be used figuratively: ""His brothers each own a slice of the business."" The expression ""slice of life"" usually describes a realistic version of life that's depicted in a book, movie, or play. And in golfing, a slice is a stroke that makes the ball curve sharply to one side.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1517,"<ul><li>Sorrow is a feeling of immense sadness, like the sorrow you would feel if your best friend suddenly moved across the country.</li><li>Sorrow is an almost unbearable sadness. In fact, it is often used as a synonym for grief. If you drop a pretty picture frame and it breaks, you might feel sad. If, on the other hand, your entire house — including that picture frame — burns to the ground, you will feel sorrow at the loss of everything, including the photographs and other mementos you can never replace.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1518,"<ul><li>Straw is a fiber made from dried plant stalks. Horses love it. People make baskets, hats, bedding, fuel, and much more from straw. But not drinking straws —those are usually plastic.</li><li>Many farm animals have sleeping areas lined with straw. This stiff, dry fiber is also added to animal feed, pressed into bricks that can be burned as fuel, and even made into bales that can comprise the walls of a home. Straw is what's left over when the grain and chaff have been removed from cereal plants like wheat. The Old English streaw literally means ""that which is scattered or strewn."" As a color, straw is light yellowish beige.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1519,"<ul><li>To swell is to expand or grow larger. If your brother's face started to swell after he ate lobster for the first time, you'd probably guess that he's allergic to shellfish.</li><li>You can use the word swell to describe what happens to an injured body part, like a black eye that swells up, or in a figurative way, to describe a feeling of fullness, like when your heart swells with pride at your sister's big music performance. In the 1930s, swell became a popular slang term meaning great or excellent. But it also can describe a wealthy, elegant person, like a group of swells at a fancy restaurant.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U16_1520,"<ul><li>Use the adjective tidy for something that is neat and clean. If your desk were more tidy, you would be able to find your computer.</li><li>Tidy (or tidy up) also means “to clean up” and is also a noun for a container for small objects, like scraps or sewing materials. These senses of tidy have a formal or even old-fashioned note. (We’re more likely to say clean, organize, or bin now in everyday conversation.) Tidy is also an informal adjective meaning ""large or considerable."" If you can put the word tidy before your profit or the sum in your bank account, it’s a good thing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1521,"<ul><li>Affection is the positive feeling you may have or express for other people or things. Your grandma may show her affection for you by pinching your cheek, and you may show your affection for your dog by rubbing her belly.</li><li>Not everybody is good at showing affection to their loved ones, like old-school dads or tough guys in action movies. If people don't get enough affection, they crave it, and will go to great lengths to get it. You might say that affection is what Luke wanted from Darth Vader all along, in Star Wars.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1522,"<ul><li>An agency usually provides a service, like an aid organization or a government bureau. If you're looking for a job, an employment agency might be able to help.</li><li>The Latin word agere means ""to do or manage,"" and it's a fitting ancestor for agency, a word that means an institution that manages or specializes in something. As a secret agent, you might work for the CIA, or Central Intelligence Agency.  I hope you look good in black. The noun agency also refers to the power or ability to do something, as in the William McKinley quote, ""War should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1523,"<ul><li>Ash is what's left after something has been burned by a fire. You need to clean the ash out of a wood stove or fireplace every once in a while.</li><li>After you burn wood in a fire pit or in a bonfire on the beach, there's ash left behind. Cigarette or cigar ash is what smokers tap off the end every so often — the burned part of the cigarette becomes ash. If you use the idiomatic phrase ""it turned to ashes in my mouth,"" you mean that something was a huge disappointment or letdown.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1524,"<ul><li>Confine is all about setting limits. If you are confined to the house, it means you can't leave it. If you're really sick, you might be confined to your bed.</li><li>Confine can be used abstractly as well. In writing a term paper, your teacher might tell you to confine your examples to ones that you can support with direct evidence. In the 19th century, pregnancy and childbirth were often referred to as a woman's confinement—a time when she couldn't get up or out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1525,"<ul><li>At the end of a lesson period, your teacher says, ""class dismissed."" This means that you and the rest of the students are free to go.</li><li>Dismiss means to let go. If a judge dismisses a case, it means he's saying it has no merit, and is throwing it out of court. If you are dismissed from your job, it means you've been fired. And if you've been ignoring your friends' warnings that your boyfriend is cheating, you've been dismissing their concerns. ""Don't dismiss me!"" is something you say when the person you're talking to is not taking you and your comments seriously.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1526,"<ul><li>A rash, a volcano, applause, violence, all of these are things that are prone to erupt, meaning they suddenly become active.</li><li>The word erupt has origins in the Latin word eruptus, the past participle of erumpere, meaning to burst forth. This lively verb can be used to describe anything that is released in a quick, violent burst, such as a bomb exploding or lava spewing forth from a volcano or even laughter. It can also be used to describe the arrival of things that burst through more quietly (but often more painfully), such as a skin condition or a tooth that’s breaking through one's gum.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1527,"<ul><li>Is it your fate to win a fortune in the lottery and retire young? Better hope so. Fate is like destiny, so that means winning the lottery would be an inevitable outcome.</li><li>The word fate traces back to the Latin word fatum, meaning “that which has been spoken,” and something that's your fate is a done deal, not open to revision. If you feel like something is your fate, you feel it's beyond your control. Fate is often referred to directly, as if it were a supernatural power: “fate tore us apart."" It can also describe your lot in life, like if it's your fate to take over the family farm.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1528,"<ul><li>Is lava flowing through your street? Then you'd better run! Lava is the hot liquid rock that pours from an erupting volcano.</li><li>Under the earth's crust is molten rock called magma, along with explosive gases. Under the right conditions, the gases send the magma up through volcanoes, which act as vents in the surface of the earth. When magma reaches the surface, it becomes lava. Over time, the hot molten lava cools and becomes very hard;  layers of lava eventually form mountains.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1529,"<ul><li>Miserable goes way beyond sad — it means absolutely wretched. Someone who's miserable feels absolutely awful.</li><li>If you were caught in the pouring rain, missed your own birthday party, and then got food poisoning, you wouldn't just feel bad. You'd be miserable — which means exceptionally unhappy. Victor Hugo's novel, Les Miserables (""The Miserable Ones""), is the story of people who live a wretched life filled with death and unhappiness. You might want to bring some tissues if you're heading to the musical!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1530,"<ul><li>To navigate is to determine a path or course. If you volunteer to navigate on your family’s road trip to Alaska, be sure you’re the type who’s willing to stop and ask for directions.</li><li>Navigate, like “navy” and “naval,” comes from the Latin word navis meaning “ship.” Without the luxury of modern technology, ancient sailors had to be excellent navigators; they often relied on the stars to chart their course. (We don’t recommend that you try this method of navigation with your family in the car.)</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1531,"<ul><li>Originate is a verb that means to start or create something. You can originate the idea of adding a fancy new coffee machine to your company's break room, and before long, your entire office could be happily drinking mocha lattes.</li><li>Originate is the place or point at which any new thing or idea starts. It usually doesn't end there, though. A carpet that originates in Turkey can travel all the way to an apartment in New York. A rumor can originate during first period, but by lunchtime it will have made its way around the entire high school.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1532,"<ul><li>The remainder is whatever is left after the rest has been used up or taken away.</li><li>In math, if you know the remainder is the number that's left after you divide, that will help you remember the meaning of this word: a remainder is what you have when others things are gone. If you ate all but one piece of a pizza, the one slice left is the remainder. If you spend all your cash except for $4, that's your remainder. Since remaining means to stay somewhere, a remainder is something that stays put.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1533,"<ul><li>When you retrieve something, you bring it back. Lots of dogs love to retrieve tennis balls, bringing them back to you over and over again.</li><li>You might retrieve your cell phone from the car, or the toys a baby throws repeatedly on the floor. You can also retrieve a memory from the recesses of your mind, or struggle to remember someone's name and then suddenly retrieve it. A retriever is a dog that's bred to bring things back — in fact, this is the word's earliest use, from the fifteenth century. The Old French root is retreuver, ""find again,"" from re-, ""again,"" and trouver, ""to find.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1534,"<ul><li>The adjective shallow can describe things that aren't very deep, like a shallow puddle, or people who don't have much emotional or intellectual depth, like shallow people who judge others on their looks and how much money they have.</li><li>Shallow likely comes from the Old English word sceald, which means ""shoal,"" the water near a shoreline. So, shallow describes something that is close to the surface — like the shallow roots of a newly-planted tree or a person whose interest in someone or something isn't very deep. For instance, a shallow person might go to the opening of a new art exhibition not so much to see the artworks as meet the wealthy people on the museum's board of trustees.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1535,"<ul><li>If you find yourself on a slippery slope, watch out: you could be sliding down a hill. Land that is not level is called a slope. Slope can also be a verb, as in land that slopes down to sea level.</li><li>Language experts believe the word slope came from the Middle English word aslope, an adverb that means “at an angle.” The word has a noun form you can use for something that is at an angle — on a slope — like a steep hill or the ramp in a parking garage. It also has a verb form that can be used to describe something that slants, like someone's signature with letters that slope to the left or an angled haircut that slopes to cover one eye.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1536,"<ul><li>Any distance between two things is called a span. These end points can be physical, like the span of a rope between two trees, or they can be more abstract, such as the span of time between five and six o'clock.</li><li>Span comes from the Old English spann, the width of the stretched-out hand, measured from thumb to little finger. It came to refer to various other measurements, such as the distance across an arch. The first reference to a length of time came in the late 16th century, and the phrase ""attention span"" first appeared in 1922 (as ""span of attention"").</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1537,"<ul><li>A superstition is a belief or practice that isn’t entirely based on facts or reality, like carrying a rabbit’s foot because you think it brings you good fortune, or believing that Friday the 13th is a day of bad luck.</li><li>When you pick up a penny, is it because you’re poor or do you think it’s lucky?  If the quickest route makes you walk under a ladder, will you do it even though it’s bad luck?  These are two examples of superstitions, irrational decisions we make for some weird reason.  The Latin roots of the word translate as “standing over,” like how you freeze standing over a broken mirror. Don’t worry, it’s only a superstition, right?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1538,"<ul><li>Sympathy is a feeling of pity or sense of compassion — it's when you feel bad for someone else who's going through something hard.</li><li>The ability to feel sympathy for others is a great part of what make us human, and it's what compels us to reach out and offer help. So have sympathy for people who confuse this word with empathy — they're awfully close in meaning. Feeling sympathy means you feel sorry for someone's situation, even if you've never been there yourself. Empathy is when you truly understand and can feel what another person is going though.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1539,"<ul><li>When you feel something vibrate, it trembles and shakes. A mild earthquake, for example, might make your chandelier vibrate.</li><li>A hummingbird's wings vibrate, and so does an electric toothbrush. That extremely rapid back-and-forth movement is what happens when something vibrates. Something can also vibrate in a more musical, resonant way — the sound of an organ might vibrate through a church, for example. The root is the Latin word vibratus, which means ""move quickly to and fro or shake.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U17_1540,"<ul><li>The verb wander describes something that has lost track. If you're watching a boring movie, your mind might begin to wander. If you don't have a clear goal, you could wander too — meaning you drift aimlessly.</li><li>When you wander mentally, your thoughts get lost. And when you wander physically, you don't have a destination, so it's also possible to lose your bearings and not know where you are — or how to get back. That's why wander is also used to describe someone who drifts from place to place or job to job without a sense of direction or purpose.</li></ul>"

You can still see suits of armor in many museums today.</li><li>These days, soldiers still use armor to protect them from bullets and other weapons, though it's not usually made of metal. Modern armor, like bullet-proof vests, is made of extremely strong, dense fabric, while 13th century armor was typically made of steel. In the 14th century, the word itself meant ""defensive covering worn in combat"" and ""means of protection,"" from the Old French armeure, ""weapons or armor,"" with its Latin root, arma, ""arms or gear.""</li></ul>"

A raging fire is blazing and you can also say other types of shining, like with talent, are types of blazing.</li><li>A fire is a blaze. Fire, when it's going strong and burning bright, is blazing. The greater the blaze, the harder a fire is to put out. You can also use this word for other types of brightness or shining. When Michael Jordan played in the NBA, he blazed across the league. Fashion trends that catch on quickly blaze across the country. If something spreads or shines like wildfire, it blazes.</li></ul>"

The distant boom of fireworks might spook your nervous dog.</li><li>Guns, thunder, drums, deep voices — all of these are capable of a pretty loud boom. When they make the sound, you can also say that they boom: ""I saw the flash of lightning and got ready for the thunder to boom."" Another kind of boom is a prosperous period, like an oil boom or an economic boom. The long pole that holds a microphone or the sail on a boat is yet another type of boom.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1544,"<ul><li>A cliff is a steep and often sheer rock face. If you stand on the edge of a cliff and peer over, you'll be able to see the waves crashing on the rocks below. But if you don't watch your step, you could fall right off that cliff.</li><li>So many action movies feature a scene in which a car chase leads to a car full of villains plunging spectacularly off a steep rock wall, or cliff. As the car hurtles over the edge of the cliff and smashes onto the rocks below, it invariably explodes in a shower of flames and a cloud of smoke.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1545,"<ul><li>The flame of a fire produces light and heat and often flickers or dances. As a verb, to flame is to be on fire or to flare up.</li><li>On the Internet, flame has a different meaning: to post or send aggressive, negative, or insulting messages in a public electronic forum. ""Flame wars"" are exchanges of such messages between individuals or parties and often occur behind a veil of anonymity. It's an appropriate term, given that inflammatory, which takes flame as its root, describes speech or action that tends to incite a heightened and negative response.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1546,"<ul><li>Independence is the state of being free of the control of some other person, country or entity. Revolutions are all about obtaining independence, most famously perhaps the Revolutionary War in America, which led to America's freedom from Britain.</li><li>Independence comes from a nice medieval French word, depenre, meaning ""to hang from,"" or ""to hang down."" The in at the beginning is Latin for ""not,"" so the word originally meant ""not hanging from,"" which is a neat description of what countries achieve by throwing off their colonizers. Teenagers also commonly seek independence from their parents — but perhaps not financial independence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1547,"<ul><li>An invasion is the movement of an army into a region, usually in a hostile attack that's part of a war or conflict.

You can call other mass movements invasions as well, like a horrifying invasion of your kitchen by cockroaches, or the invasion of a stadium by excited soccer fans. A common phrase is ""invasion of privacy,"" which means an unfair intrusion into someone's personal space or private information.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1548,"<ul><li>Traditionally the noun knight means someone born of the nobility and trained to fight, usually in heavy metal armor. If a king decides to knight you, that means the king wants to make you into a knight.</li><li>Real life knights haven’t been around since the Middle Ages, which ended around 600 years ago. These days knight is an honorary title awarded by nations with royal families like the UK. These nations will knight anyone they think is deserving from a rock star to a politician. More casually, you can use knight to describe anyone who acts chivalrously, or bravely. If you are rescued from a burning building, you might call your rescuer, a ""knight in shining armor.""</li></ul>"

You can tell how close the lightning is by how long the delay is between the light and the sound of the rolling roar or crack of thunder that accompanies it. If they're close together, get inside, quick! Because lighting strikes so fast, we use its name for other speedy things, like the lightning-fast service at a good coffee shop.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1550,"<ul><li>When you rebel against your parents by dyeing your hair green and staying out without calling, you are acting in a way that questions both their authority and their rules about what is right and acceptable.</li><li>A rebel is someone who fights authority. The story of a rebel often finds its way into books and movies. In the 1950s film ""Rebel without a Cause,"" a teenager rebels against his parents. In the ""Star Wars"" movies, the Jedi rebel against the Empire. A rebel, whether the cause they are fighting for is just or not, is always the underdog. One pronunciation hint, rebel as a noun has the stress on the first syllable and as a verb on the second.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1551,"<ul><li>The noun retreat means a place you can go to be alone, to get away from it all. A spot under a shady tree might be your favorite retreat from the sun, or your bedroom in the basement may serve as a retreat from your siblings.</li><li>In the military sense, the noun retreat means the withdrawal of troops. The British retreat after the Battles of Lexington and Concord gave the American colonists an early taste of victory during the American Revolution. As a verb, retreat means to back out of something — like a lawyer who is forced to retreat from his argument when the opposing evidence is too convincing.</li></ul>"

In the vegetable world, separate stalks of asparagus are called spears.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1554,"<ul><li>Steep means sharply angled. When hiking trails lead straight up mountainsides, they've got a steep incline. Steep also means ""to soak in,"" as in steeping a tea bag in boiling water.</li><li>You often hear steep used as an adjective to describe cliffs, hills, or even water park slides that have a perilous slope. Steep can apply to curves on a chart––you might say when someone who has a lot to learn that their learning curve is going to be steep. Steep also comes up to describe exorbitant changes in costs or spending. Everyone would love to travel more, but sometimes plane fare is too steep.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U18_1555,"<ul><li>What better place for the mountain-climbing summit than on the summit of the mountain. A summit can mean either a meeting between people who are interested in the same subject or the peak of the mountain.</li><li>Although originally meant to describe a meeting between the heads of state, summit can be used to describe any gathering of people who care deeply about the same topic. If, for example, you are the captain of your chess club, you might attend the upcoming Chess Club Summit, at which new rules of the tournament will be discussed.

Moreover, while summit also means the very top of a mountain, summit can be used metaphorically to mean a variety of heights, such as the summit of a career, an industry, or any kind of major effort.</li></ul>"

This  eventually morphed into the word we know as warrior. The word can also refer to someone fighting a philosophical or political war. Author Carlos Castandeda said, ""Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. We make ourselves into one or the other.”  After ridding the kitchen of ants, you felt like a proud warrior.</li></ul>"

You might withdraw money from the bank or withdraw yourself from an argument if it gets out of hand.</li><li>The word withdraw comes from Middle English and still means to draw or take back, like if you withdraw your hand when you’re done holding hands with someone. A newer definition of withdraw is to stay away from others or stop participating in something. You might withdraw from society by holing up in your house, or withdraw from school by dropping out.

To avoid being tripped, Mary was forced to yield to the children on her way to the brownie plate.</li><li>While these meanings seem quite different, they both essentially mean ""to give."" The recipe gives twelve brownies to those who follow it, and Mary is giving up her right to go first. Yield can also mean the rate of return on an investment. A bond yields an interest rate of 2%, or gives an investor $2.00 for every $100 invested.</li></ul>"

A city park bench is a nice place to sit and eat a sandwich.</li><li>A picnic table often has benches, and a bench is where baseball players wait for their turn to take a swing at the ball. You might have a work bench in your garage for gluing model planes together.

4000EEW_B03_U19_1562,"<ul><li>A daisy is a cheerful white flower with yellow in the center. Drive through the countryside in mid-summer and you can often see whole fields full of daisies.</li><li>Daisies grow wild in many places, and they're also cultivated in gardens as a perennial, a plant that returns year after year. One invasive variation is called a ""lawn daisy"" because it quickly and easily takes over grassy lawns and is notoriously hard to mow down. The word daisy comes from day's eye, an informal name that arose from the flower's habit of closing its petals when the sun goes down at the end of the day.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1563,"<ul><li>If kids can't settle their own argument, they may need someone to mediate their dispute, or conflict. You can often tell this is the case if you hear the loud cry, ""Mom!""</li><li>The noun dispute means any conflict or disagreement. The countries were in the middle of a border dispute; both sides claimed the toxic waste dump belonged to the other. As a verb, dispute can mean to quarrel or argue, but it can also mean to take exception to something. If your boasting friend crows because you lost the trivia game to her by 150 points, you may want to dispute the facts. It was only 145 points.</li></ul>"

If you're a pessimist, you can't help but notice that 50% of your glass is now empty — that is, it contains nothing.</li><li>Empty comes from an Old English word meaning ""at leisure,"" or in other words, ""unoccupied."" Over time, the sense of that meaning changed from ""not at work"" to ""devoid of contents."" By the tenth century, any container that could be filled or full could also be emptied or empty. As the word continued to evolve, it developed a more figurative sense. If you feel sad and lost, you might say that you feel so empty. If you want to go to the movies and your parents say, ""No, but maybe tomorrow,"" you probably consider that an empty promise, one that will never be fulfilled.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1565,"<ul><li>The noun horror means intense fear, so you can use it when you describe the horror you felt when you dreamed you were flying on a bumpy airplane with a bunch of clowns.</li><li>Horror is a powerful word that refers to a powerful feeling, either of terror, disgust, or shock. You might reel back from the horror of a smelly locker room, or gasp in horror at a gory scene in a movie.

4000EEW_B03_U19_1566,"<ul><li>An incident refers to a particular happening, sometimes criminal but always noteworthy. If there was a food fight in the cafeteria, an e-mail might be sent to the parents of all students telling of the incident at school.</li><li>The word incident is quite vague. It can refer to a humorous occurrence or a violent one, something that disturbed one's routine or something unusual that happened. If a child screams in a library, it's not that unusual, but if an adult does, that's an incident! As an adjective, incident is used in the field of physics to describe particles or radiation that fall on a surface. The incident light showed how dirty the windows were.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1567,"<ul><li>Mist is a very dense water vapor, almost as thick as fog. Light rain can sometimes form a mist that makes it hard to see the road when you're driving.</li><li>The mist you see in the air on a damp spring morning is similar to the mist you spray when you water your plants — it's made up of tiny water droplets. As a verb, mist means ""to cover with mist,"" so you might mist your dry plants or watch your windows mist up in the rain. Mist can also refer to a general dimness or cloudiness: ""She watched through the mist of her tears.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1568,"<ul><li>When your younger brother runs around the house with scissors, you should definitely object. Perhaps a less sharp object such as a roll of paper towels would suffice.</li><li>An object (OB-ject) is something that is a visible entity, something that can be perceived by the senses. If you are unsure whether something is an object, test it by seeing whether it can cast a shadow; if it can, it's an object, if it can't, it's not. In court, lawyers will often say, ""I object!"" Here, the verb object (ob-JECT) means to express disagreement.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1569,"<ul><li>An orphan is someone who has lost both parents. Usually, we think of sad little children when we think of orphans, but anyone whose parents have both died is an orphan.</li><li>A home for orphans is no substitute for a house with loving parents, even if they're adopted. Bambi, Annie, and Oliver Twist are probably the most famous orphans. Each lost their parents in different ways, but all of them had their lives similarly changed—they felt adrift without a parent to guide them. Orphans often spend lots of time looking for friends or surrogates to fill the gap left by their deceased parents.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1570,"<ul><li>A plot is a scheme, a story, a map charting progress, or a piece of land (as for a garden). To plot is to devise the secret plan, order the events of the story, or track your movement on the map.</li><li>You could make a whole movie based the word plot. This could be the plot (story): An evil so-and-so hatches a secret plot (scheme) to follow the explorer to a legendary plot (patch) of land with buried treasure. The explorer plots (draws) the best route to the treasure, but the evil so-and-so steals the plot (map) and gets to the treasure first. What a great story. All that's left is to plot (arrange) the sequence of events for maximum suspense.</li></ul>"

If you are pregnant it is important to take excellent care of your health — it's good for tyou and good for the baby.</li><li>Pregnant comes from Latin, and literally means ""before giving birth"" — prae-, like pre- means ""before"" and gnasci is a root that means ""be born."" Pregnant can also mean ""filled with something,"" like inspiration or ""rich in significance or implication,"" like your pregnant pause before answering your friend's question, ""You like my new boyfriend, don't you?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1572,"<ul><li>Rage is a really intense anger. Some frustrated drivers let their emotions boil over into road rage when another car cuts them off, for example.</li><li>If you're full of rage, you're full of anger — powerful, extreme, sometimes even violent anger. Rage can also be a verb: you might rage against something you hate or as the poet Dylan Thomas pleaded, ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" Things that rage are out of control, like a raging, roaring fire or a wild storm. Another meaning involves the latest, greatest trend — you'd say it's ""all the rage.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1573,"<ul><li>Someone seeking revenge is looking to retaliate for a wrong that has been done.</li><li>Sometimes a word can be used as either a noun or a verb, without changing the spelling. That's the case with revenge. You can take revenge (noun) on someone who hurt you, or you can revenge (verb) the hurt, punishing the person who wronged you. While revenge may be sweet, it usually just leads to more revenge from the other side, and so on. While that makes a good Shakespeare play, it can get pretty wearing in real life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1574,"<ul><li>Shame is a painful feeling that's a mix of regret, self-hate, and dishonor. A good person would feel shame if they cheated on a test or did something mean to a friend.</li><li>Feeling shame — or being ashamed — is one of the most miserable feelings of them all. When you feel shame, you feel like a bad person and regret what you did. If you're trying to make someone else feel bad by scolding them, you're shaming them. People also often say, ""That's a shame,"" when something bad happens — meaning it's sad or a pity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1575,"<ul><li>The sound that you make when you exhale loudly to show frustration, boredom, or relief is called a sigh. No matter how much you sigh during your family's annual car trip to the Grand Canyon, your dad won't drive any faster.</li><li>Something that sounds like a human sigh is also called a sigh. The breeze might sigh in the still night air, or a screen door might sigh closed. The word sigh comes from the Old English word of the same meaning, sican, which was probably imitative, echoing the sound of a sigh.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1576,"<ul><li>The word sneak has many shades of meaning, but all involve doing something in a secretive or stealthy way. If you sneak home after midnight, that means you’re quietly creeping into the house so no one will hear you.</li><li>In addition to moving furtively, sneak can also mean doing something secretly or slipping something in. You might sneak a cookie when no one is looking, or you might sneak your brother into a concert. You could even sneak a glance at that cute guy in your math class — you do it when you think no one will notice. Sneak has a noun form that describes a furtive person — someone who does a lot of sneaking.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1577,"<ul><li>Spare describes something that is extra. If you have a spare tire for your bike you can replace a flat, and if there's enough change in your pocket you can spare some to patch a friend's tire.</li><li>As a noun, a verb, and an adjective, the word spare has many meanings. A leftover part is a spare, you can spare a life when you save an animal or person, and you have spare time when you finish a project early. If you ""spare no expense"" you spend lots of money and when you spare a friend's feelings, you keep upsetting details to yourself.

4000EEW_B03_U19_1578,"<ul><li>A stem is a plant's stalk, and it's also a verb meaning ""grow out of."" So roses have stems, and your idea to give roses to your mom for her birthday stems from her love of flowers.</li><li>A stem can be the central root of a word, the supporting structure of a plant, or the thin, cylindrical part of a glass goblet. When one thing stems from something else, it originates or begins growing there: ""His vegetarianism stems from his love of animals."" An older meaning of the verb is ""stop the flow of something,"" as in ""Stem your nosebleed with this tissue!"" or ""Some people think streetlights will stem the graffiti on that street.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U19_1579,"<ul><li>Supper, which is also known as dinner, is usually the third daily meal you eat. Many families try to sit down and eat supper together at the end of the day.</li><li>First comes breakfast, then lunch, and then finally, in the evening, it's time for supper. The word supper is less common today than dinner, although North Americans generally consider the words to be synonyms. Until the early 20th century, the meal we now generally refer to as lunch was called dinner, while the evening meal was supper. It comes from the Old French soper, ""to eat the evening meal.""</li></ul>"

Skip forward another century, and tender could also imply a lack of maturity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1581,"<ul><li>Things that are under something else are beneath it. A star gazer is beneath the night sky, and tropical fish swim beneath the surface of the water.</li><li>When one apple hangs lower on a tree than another, the first apple is beneath the second. You can also use the adjective beneath in a figurative way, to describe something that ranks lower or has a low worth or status: ""He didn't want to play soccer at all, because he thought the Junior Varsity team was beneath him."" The Old English root is beneoðan, combining be-, ""by,"" and neoðan, ""below.""</li></ul>"

A mother fox sometimes carries her cub by the scruff of its neck.</li><li>Use the word cub when you talk about one of a number of meat-eating mammal babies, including bears, foxes, lions, and tigers. While a tiny bear cub looks as adorable and helpless as a stuffed animal, its mother is ferocious and protective of her cubs. In the old days, people also called a young, immature boy a cub — today, a human cub is more likely to be a junior Boy Scout — a Cub Scout.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U20_1584,"<ul><li>If you're dissatisfied, you're not happy — you're annoyed and disgruntled. You probably don't enjoy eating out with your parents if they're always dissatisfied with the food they order.</li><li>You might be dissatisfied with the final episode of your favorite TV show, or dissatisfied with your grades n German last semester. In either case, you're not pleased. A slightly different way to be dissatisfied is to be unconvinced: ""She was dissatisfied with the answer he gave when she asked when he planned to pay back the money he owed her."" Dissatisfied combines dis-, ""not,"" and satisfied, from a Latin root, satisfacere, ""do enough.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1585,"<ul><li>Ease means to lessen or release, often making something possible in the meantime. When you put someone at their ease, you lessen their discomfort. When you ease into a chair, you gently release yourself into it.</li><li>A life of ease means you do not have to struggle to make money. Your dad might be mad if you pierce your nose, but eventually, with time, his anger will ease and he will ease up on you. Your older siblings' behavior will ease the way for you to do things that frighten your parents without their overreacting.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1586,"<ul><li>If something is evident, it's visible. If you blush furiously and start shaking every time your crush comes near, your infatuation will be evident to everyone.</li><li>Evident means conspicuously visible, often the mark of an action or a feeling. If a room is in total disarray, with everything pulled out of the drawers, it's evident that someone has been searching for something. If you leave the room in the middle of a tense meeting, your frustration will be evident. Evident can also simply mean visible. If you look closely at a key hole of your car door, small scratches will be evident in the paint.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1587,"<ul><li>Hail is when chunks of ice fall from the sky.  Also, to hail someone is to greet them or say good things about them. Or it can be a way to tell people of your homeland, as in: ""I hail from the Moon.""</li><li>If twenty third-graders all sent spit-balls up in the air at once, the spit-balls would then hail down on the class. If a presidential candidate has an idea for fixing the nation's woes, many people will hail that idea.  If you see your former prom date walking down the street, you may want to hail them to say hello — or perhaps you'll want to hail a cab and get out of there as fast as you can.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1588,"<ul><li>To howl is to make a long, sad, crying sound. You might howl every once in a while, but it's more common to hear wolves and dogs let loose and howl, especially in the presence of a full moon.</li><li>Terribly sad or fearful people howl, and wolves howl to communicate with each other. Your dog might howl at the sound of a passing fire truck, which also makes a noise with its siren that you can call a howl.

The word can convey a happy feeling, as when William Wordsworth writes, ""My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky."" As a side note, the game of leap-frog appears to have had its beginnings in the 1590s.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1590,"<ul><li>The adjective magnificent describes something that has grandeur, like the magnificent Great Wall of China or the Pyramids, which usually inspire awe in the people who see them.</li><li>The word magnificent comes from the 1510s, from the Old French word of the same spelling, meaning ""doing great deeds."" That's why rulers were often called ""magnificent,"" though this adjective also describes things that are impressively large, like a magnificent volunteer force made up of thousands of people. Magnificent can also mean ""absolutely excellent,"" like the magnificent play that everyone wants to see.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1591,"<ul><li>A good camping knife is a necessity if you’re going to be hiking in a heavily forested region. A necessity is something that you must have in order to complete a task.</li><li>When used in the plural, necessities are items required for a situation but nothing extra. You probably only bring the bare necessities to a sleepover — pajamas and a toothbrush. Sometimes a necessity is a thing you must know how to do. Knowing how to balance your checkbook is a financial necessity. In some cases, necessity simply means ""need."" Do you do your homework out of necessity or because you want to?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1592,"<ul><li>The result of something, or the consequence of it, is the outcome. If your oldest child announces that your youngest child has climbed onto the roof with a handmade set of wings, you should probably not expect a good outcome. Better run!</li><li>The noun outcome refers to the result of a process, but recently, when joined with the word ""based"", it has become jargon within a variety of industries and you'll see uses like outcome-based medicine and outcome-based budgeting. Outcome-based education, for example, rewards schools and teachers whose students meet certain goals on standardized tests, although critics argue this robs teachers and students of creativity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1593,"<ul><li>A pile is a heap of stuff that keeps accumulating, like the dirty laundry in the back of your closet, or Uncle Scrooge’s money.</li><li>Pile can be used as a noun or a verb. If you pile rocks on top of each other, you will eventually have a...pile of rocks. Unlike the word stack, pile implies that your heap of stuff is fairly messy. It can also mean cram. When eight people pile into a car with only five seats, they’re likely to be pretty much squashed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1594,"<ul><li>When you need a word that's deeper than ""deep,"" consider profound. A philosopher is likely to make many profound pronouncements.</li><li>Profundus literally means ""deep"" in Latin, and profound had the same meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it also meant ""figuratively deep"" — that is, very great or intense: ""The new laws have had a profound impact."" Of people, it means ""very knowledgeable or insightful,"" but sometimes when a person tries to sound profound, they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed up with big words.</li></ul>"

After all, everyone will want that solar-powered puppy petter, so you'd better grab the opportunity and buy two!</li><li>You can seize all kinds of things. Seize the day if you are taking advantage of the present circumstances and enjoying life to the fullest. Seize the castle, if you are a feudal lord fighting with your neighbor. Seize the inspiration if you want to tell a moving story. Seize authority if you are overthrowing a small country. Avoid, at all costs, being seized if you are under zombie attack.</li></ul>"

If you squeeze your toothpaste from the bottom up, you'll get the most out of your tube.</li><li>The word squeeze has to do with force or pressure. When you squeeze something, like an orange, you are crushing it to extract juice.  When you squeeze into a pair of jeans, you're forcing yourself into them. When you give someone a squeeze, you're giving them a tight hug.  And when you're in a squeeze, you're in a tight spot, or a bind.</li></ul>"

A supreme being is a god or other higher power. A supreme leader is an all-powerful ruler. Sometimes, when everyone else is driving you crazy, you might daydream about being the supreme leader of your school, office, or maybe the entire country, so you could tell everyone else what to do. Or you might just order a supreme pizza, which usually has every imaginable topping on it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1598,"<ul><li>Something that's terrific is wonderful, like a terrific concert you'll never forget. Terrific can also describe something very intense, like a terrific thunderstorm.</li><li>Anything huge or loud or forceful can be described with the adjective terrific. A marathon runner might put in a terrific effort during the last mile of the race, or a band can make a terrific racket when it practices. Terrific can also mean great, like your terrific new hair cut. Terrific's origin is more scary than wonderful: the Latin root is terrificus, causing terror or fear.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U20_1599,"<ul><li>A trait is something about you that makes you ""you."" When your mother says that you get all your best traits from her, she means you have the same charming smile and the same brilliant mind as she has.</li><li>In science, trait refers to a characteristic that is caused by genetics. Having green eyes or being shorter than average are traits a person might have. In more general use, a trait is an important part of someone’s personality or appearance.

4000EEW_B03_U20_1600,"<ul><li>A patient's vital signs are their important body functions, such as pulse rate, that shows they are still alive. Use the adjective vital to describe something that is important and necessary, or a person full of energy.</li><li>Vital descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Latin vītālis, from vīta, ""life."" If you are vital to the organization you work for, it means they cannot live without you — or at least that you're an important part of the team. If you're a vital force in your church volunteer group, you probably are a leader with lots of energy to give.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1601,"<ul><li>When you attack, you charge or advance violently. It's scary to watch a big dog attack a smaller dog.</li><li>In the military, an attack is an advance of troops or the use of armed force against an enemy. When one little kid attacks another, there usually aren't any bombs or weapons involved, but the idea of force or hostility is the same. You might also attack an opponent in a game, or withstand a verbal attack from a classmate during a debate. The Italian source of attack is attacco, ""an attack,"" from attaccare, ""join battle.""</li></ul>"

The best chance of surviving cancer usually involves finding and treating it early.</li><li>The word cancer actually means ""crab,"" like the zodiac sign. Around 400 B.C., Greek physician Hippocrates is said to have named the disease karkinos, which is Greek for ""crab,"" when he noticed that tumors formed a crab-like shape. The word cancer describes not just a disease, but any sort of evilness that can spread. Hatred and bigotry are cancers that can destroy communities.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1604,"<ul><li>Cancerous describes things that are related to a disease in which abnormal cells grow and spread very quickly. Biopsies are usually done to determine if a suspicious lump or mass is cancerous or not.</li><li>Anything cancerous contains or is distinguished by cancer, like a cancerous tumor or cancerous tissue that has to be treated with radiation. You can also use the word figuratively, for destructive things that seem to multiply and spread the way cancer does: ""The cancerous rumor was all over the school by the next morning, when everyone was whispering about it."" The Greek root of cancerous and cancer is karkinos, which means both ""tumor"" and ""crab.""</li></ul>"

Whether it's in a prison or in your blood (or even in the political landscape), a cell is a small room, space, or unit.</li><li>Blood is composed of countless individual cells, as are virtually all of the organs of the body: skin, liver, lungs, brain, etc. The cell is the basic unit of all biology. A cell  in a prison is the room in which a prisoner lives. But did you know that a cell can also be a small group of people devoted to a larger political cause? The government's security forces are constantly on the lookout for terrorist ""sleeper cells"" and would love to get the members of a sleeper cell into a prison cell.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1606,"<ul><li>A small tube of paper that's filled with tobacco and lit with a match is a cigarette. Because cigarettes take a terrible toll on smokers' health, the number of people who smoke them has declined recently.</li><li>Most cigarettes come in packages, each cigarette a perfect slim cylinder topped with a filter. When a cigarette is smoked all the way to this filter, it becomes a ""butt."" The main chemical in cigarettes is called nicotine, and it's extremely addictive — other additives in cigarettes can cause various cancers and lung diseases. Because of these dangers, cigarettes are regulated and highly taxed. The word itself comes from the French, meaning ""little cigar.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1607,"<ul><li>A code can be a set of principles. Our laws make up our legal code, and many people govern themselves through a personal ""code of honor."" Code can also mean a system for sending secret messages, or programming language for computers.</li><li>In 1303, you could only use code to mean a set of laws, such as a code of conduct. It wasn’t until 1808 that you could use code to describe a system for sending secret messages. The verb form appeared in 1815, meaning to create laws or send secret messages, and gave birth to encode. In the computer programming context, encode was shortened back again to code, meaning to write instructions for a computer program. Soon the lines of text themselves began to be referred to as simply code.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1608,"<ul><li>A cure is a treatment that ends an illness or makes you feel better. There is no cure for the common cold, or for a broken heart. Waaaaa.</li><li>Many researchers focus on finding cures for diseases like cancer and diabetes — while it is possible to recover from incurable illnesses, it's not possible to cure them. You could also say, ""This Florida winter is going to cure me of missing Minnesota!"" When someone cures meat or fish, they smoke or salt it to preserve it. The Latin root is curare, ""take care of.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1609,"<ul><li>Destruction is damage so bad, things must be replaced, not fixed. Tornadoes often leave a trail of destruction, damaging neighborhoods and knocking down houses.</li><li>The Latin word destructionem, ""a pulling down,"" is the root of destruction. When destruction strikes, things do get pulled down — from houses in the case of natural disasters or a big display of canned soups in the case of a careless shopper. Sometimes, destruction refers to death, as when critics of war talk about the resulting destruction of human life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1610,"<ul><li>Your  DNA is what makes you uniquely you. It's that double helix that your genes are made of. Your DNA accounts for why you resemble your parents and it distinguishes you from your pet frog and from everybody else.</li><li>DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, sometimes called ""the molecule of life,"" as almost all organisms have their genetic material codified as DNA. Since each person’s DNA is unique, ""DNA typing"" is a valuable tool in connecting suspects to crime scenes. You can also use the word less scientifically, as in “it’s just not in my DNA to sit through six hours of meetings.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1611,"<ul><li>When something is far-reaching or expansive it is extensive.  When your friend knows every single place and time that his favorite band has played any given song, he has extensive knowledge of that band.</li><li>Use the adjective extensive for something that goes on and on and on.  It works for anything that covers a lot of territory either in physical space, as in ""the gardens at the palace are extensive,"" or conceptually, as in ""her knowledge of the mortgage-backed securities market is extensive.""  If you are a farmer, you would also use extensive to mean that you are able to work a lot of land without too much effort or manual labor.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1612,"<ul><li>The female animals are the ones who can have babies. They’re not males. Girls and women are female humans, but there are male and female animals of all kinds. Just ask Noah.</li><li>Female animals are those that produce ova, which are fertilized by the spermatozoa of males. The main difference between females and males is that females bear the offspring — and that goes for dogs, chickens, catfish, and anything in between. There are even male and female squash flowers. The word female is used equally as a noun and an adjective. For example, the female lead in a play is inevitably a female.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1613,"<ul><li>Just when you think your friend has finished her long list of complaints, she begins a new sentence with, “Furthermore…” a word that signals she has even more to complain about.</li><li>Furthermore is a useful word when you have an additional point to make in an argument or explanation. It is often used at the beginning of a sentence and followed by a comma. You might tell your parents why you think you should go on a Hawaiian vacation and then add, “Furthermore, volcanic ash is excellent for the complexion.” For variety, you can also use words like moreover  or additionally in the same way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1614,"<ul><li>Microscopic, yet powerful, a gene is segment of DNA, the molecule that stores the code for building living bodies.</li><li>A gene is a single unit of genetic information, stored on twisting strands in every cell of every living being. In sexual reproduction, the parents' genes mix together to make the child. Although people would like to think that genes code for discrete traits, like friendliness or mathematical genius, that's not the case. Genes control the color of your eyes and the shape of your toes, not your weird personality.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U21_1615,"<ul><li>When your grandmother dies, you might inherit her tea set. Regardless of her death, you might inherit her sense of humor or rather large nose. To inherit is to receive from a predecessor.</li><li>When you are talking about property, inherit is always used to describe something you get after someone else has died. However, there doesn't have to be a death involved to use the word inherit. When you start a new job, you might inherit less than pleasant tasks from the person who had the job before you. You might also quickly inherit their desire to find a new place to work.</li></ul>"

When there is a link, that means two things are connected — such as ""the link between smoking and lung cancer."" Some people even create links, like butchers who make sausage links and website developers who hyperlink the sites you visit to ensure that you spend far too much time clicking around the Web.</li></ul>"

The population of Wyoming is just shy of 600,000 people, but the population of California is nearly 40 million!</li><li>This word can also be used for subgroups of people. If you plan to start an all-ages ping pong league, you'll want to determine the population of table-tennis enthusiasts in your hometown. Population can apply to groups of animals, too. Because of the worldwide decrease in the panda population, giant pandas are now an endangered species. The word population, like the word populace, derives from the Latin populus, meaning ""people.""</li></ul>"

The result of your practical joke is a puddle of water on the floor and a lump on your cousin's head where the bucket hit him.</li><li>A result is also the answer to some problem, especially one obtained by calculation or experimentation. The result you get for a math problem will be wrong if you add when you should multiply. The verb result means to follow as an outcome of some action.

Sugar isn’t only a food, it’s also an essential part of living cells and a source of energy for all animals.</li><li>There are two main senses of sugar. First is refined sugar — the crystals that sweeten and preserve many foods. This yummy stuff comes from the sugarcane and  sugar beet plants, and really hit the scene in the 18th and 19th centuries when sugar plantations spread and more people could get sugar. The other kind of sugar refers to biochemistry, and these sugars are an important part of the cells of all living things.</li></ul>"

If you accommodate your brother's demand for the attic room, then you give in and let him take over that space.</li><li>Accommodate entered English in the mid-16th century from the Latin word accommodat-, meaning ""made fitting."" Whether it refers to changing something to suit someone's wishes or providing someone with something he needs, accommodate typically involves making something fit. You might change your lunch plans, for example, to accommodate your best friend's schedule. Accommodate can also refer to providing housing or having enough space for something. You might need to open up the extra bedroom to accommodate your out-of-town guests.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1622,"<ul><li>A circus is a group of many different performers, often including clowns, trapeze artists, and animal trainers. When the circus comes to town, you'll see a big, striped  tent being set up for the show.</li><li>The ringmaster of a circus has historically been a kind of narrator, calling for the audience's attention and announcing different entertainers. Traditional circuses have performing animals, clowns, and acrobats, while more contemporary circuses combine elements of theater, dance, acrobatics, and music. You can also use circus to mean ""noisy, confused activity."" In Latin, the word circus means ""ring,"" and the Romans used it to describe the arenas in which performances took place.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1623,"<ul><li>When things happen at the same time, they are said to coincide. Often, this is because they're intentionally coordinated — ""the bake sale coincided with Parent Day"" — but not always.</li><li>Coincide can also mean happen together in other ways. ""My mother's views on appropriate teen fashion do not always coincide with mine"" is a tactful way to say she hates your clothes. You could also describe two roads coming together as coinciding — though it's more poetic to talk about when they diverge.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1624,"<ul><li>The word commission has several very different meanings, but in its most basic meaning, commission is the act of passing a responsibility to someone else. If you receive a government commission, that means you have been assigned a task by the government.</li><li>Another common meaning of commission is the amount of money an employee earns when they sell something: In addition to his salary, he gets a 1% commission on each sale. A commission is also an order for someone to do something and get paid: The artist received a commission for a new painting to hang in the building lobby. And a commission is a high-ranking position in the armed forces, or a special committee that controls or investigates something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1625,"<ul><li>A dose is the amount of medicine you're supposed to take. A bottle of aspirin has the recommended dose printed on its side.</li><li>When your doctor prescribes medication, she tells you what dose you should take, whether it's one pill twice a day or two teaspoons just before bedtime. You can also get a dose of something else: having x-rays gives you a small dose of radiation, for example, and watching the news instead of your favorite cartoon can be said to give you a dose of reality. The Greek root of dose is dosis, ""a portion prescribed.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1626,"<ul><li>Dye is a substance that's used to change the color of whatever it's applied to. You can use hair dye to change your light brown hair to deep, dark purple.</li><li>Dye is used on fabrics, hair, yarn and other fibers, clothing, and food, among other things. When you apply dye to something, you dye it. If you're baking a birthday cake for your friend who loves the color orange, you might use food coloring — a type of dye — to dye the vanilla frosting orange. The Old English root of dye is deah, ""a color or hue,"" which is possibly related to deagol, ""secret, hidden, or dark.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1627,"<ul><li>The extent is the area something covers. That could be physical space or something like being prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</li><li>Use the word extent when you are discussing how far something extends — how far it reaches. If you're an expert, the extent of your knowledge is wide. If you own a lot of property, the extent of your land is huge. The full extent of something is like the limit — that's the end of it. If you've reached the extent of your patience, you're out of patience. If an earthquake destroyed your house, the extent of the damage was severe.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1628,"<ul><li>People use the word gender to indicate your biological sex or your sense of being female, male, or a combination of both. Danica Patrick is someone who has broken many gender barriers by being a successful female race-car driver in a male-dominated sport.</li><li>If you've learned French, Spanish, or Latin, you know these languages assign genders to nouns, such as masculine, feminine, or neuter. Besides this grammatical use, gender and sex are very often used as synonyms in everyday speech. However, while sex refers to biological differences between men and women, gender is much more complicated and changeable, influenced by society, culture, and an individual person's self-identity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1629,"<ul><li>A headline is the title of a newspaper story. You'll know the headline, because it's printed in the largest font on the front of the paper.</li><li>Printed newspapers have headlines, and online journals, magazines, and newspapers also use headlines. A headline is the title of a story in the paper, and it's usually easy to spot by its large, bold letters. Sometimes television and radio news also use the word headline to mean the biggest, most important news stories of the day. The word was originally a printer's term for the title and page number, and by 1890 it meant ""newspaper title.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1630,"<ul><li>If something’s informal, it’s casual and relaxed and doesn’t follow any particular rules or conventions, whether that's a style of writing, or the dress code for your dinner party.</li><li>If you have informal plans to see your friend, that means you’ll get together but you’re not sure when — you’ll figure it out later. Informal also means “casual,” like wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Informal writing or speech is the linguistic equivalent of wearing jeans and a t-shirt, with a relaxed tone and simple words. In an informal football club, you don't pay dues to anyone, you just show up at the park and play with whoever is there.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1631,"<ul><li>The verb inquire means ""to ask for information."" If you wonder about how the world began, you inquire about its origin.</li><li>Inquire comes from the Latin combination of words in, meaning ""into"" and quærere, meaning ""ask, seek."" When you inquire, you look into something. You might ask a question, like inquiring if the bakery is hiring any cake decorators. Inquire can also mean ""to conduct an investigation."" No matter how you do it, when you inquire, you seek answers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1632,"<ul><li>Use the noun messenger to refer to someone who brings you a message. Your mail carrier delivering a postcard and your gossipy friend calling to give you the latest news can each be described as a messenger.</li><li>Delivering messages for others is certainly a time-honored profession, since even the gods of Antiquity needed someone to do it — the Greeks had Hermes and the Romans had Mercury as their messenger gods. A messenger carries a message, and that's where the word itself comes from: the Latin root of message is missus, which means ""a sending away, sending, dispatching"" and is the past participle of mittere, ""send.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1633,"<ul><li>A peer is someone at your own level. If you are a 10th grader, other high school students are your peers.</li><li>Peer comes from the Latin par which means equal. When you are on par with someone, you are their peer. If kids your age are pressuring you to do something you don't want to do, that's peer pressure. In the sport of basketball, Michael Jordan was without peer, no one could equal his talent. When he switched to baseball, he found himself to be among peers again.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1634,"<ul><li>A portrait is a portrayal of a person, usually showing the person's face (but not always). A portrait can be a painting, a photograph, an ink drawing, a sculpture — or even a description in words or in a film.</li><li>Portrait is a term often used when talking about artwork. Go to an art museum, especially one that has a historic collection, and you'll likely see many portraits hanging on the walls. Formal portraits were commissioned by wealthy people throughout history. A portrait can also be a written description of someone's appearance or character. If you describe your Mom in such detail that everyone can imagine what she's like, you've created a portrait of her.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1635,"<ul><li>To pose is to assume a particular stance. Like a runway model strutting to the end of the catwalk, posing with her hands on her hips, and then gracefully walking back.</li><li>The original meaning of pose from the 14th century is ""to put in a certain position."" The sense of pose as ""to assume a certain attitude"" emerged in the 1850’s. When a person poses, he presents himself in a particular way, often with the hope of impressing others. But if you're just posing objects, then the word loses the negative connotation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U22_1636,"<ul><li>A ranch is a large farm that raises animals, generally grazing animals like cows or sheep. If you dream of raising big, strange-looking birds, you could decide to have an emu or an ostrich ranch instead.</li><li>Ranches raise animals for meat, and in the case of sheep or alpacas, for wool. When you work on a ranch, you can say that you ranch. A ranch is also a type of single-story, simple house architecturally influenced by the western, informal style of working ranches, which first appeared in the 1950s in the Western US. Ranch comes from the Spanish rancho, first ""group of people who eat together"" and later ""group of farm huts.""</li></ul>"

It's a bad idea to let your five year-old steer; you might end up in a sandbox. But the use of steer doesn't need to be limited to wheels and handle bars. If you have a friend torn between whether or not to go to college, you can help steer her towards the right decision. The President's job is ""to steer the Ship of State.""</li></ul>"

A circus lion is tame (adjective) because it’s been tamed (verb). A “lion-tamer” beat the wildness out of it.</li><li>Sometimes tame isn’t fun — and not just for the bears who ride bicycles under the Big Top. Tame isn’t appealing when you’re going on a rollercoaster or seeing a fireworks display. If a friend tells you a concert is tame, will you rush out for tickets? Tame, however, is not all bad.

You might tempt your runaway dog back inside with pieces of cheese.</li><li>The verb tempt often has negative implications: ""Don't let those bullies tempt you into picking on smaller kids!"" When something tempts you, it's often with the knowledge that it's not the best idea, however attractive it might be. Tempt was originally a religious term, meaning ""to entice to evil or sin,"" while today it's more likely to be a slice of cake that tempts us than the devil.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1641,
4000EEW_B03_U23_1642,"<ul><li>Cautious, like careful, means you're on guard. You should be cautious crossing a busy street, or cautious borrowing your sister's new shoes without asking.</li><li>A fusing of caution and ous, the adjective cautiousis the opposite of hasty and rash. It actually comes from the Latin word cautus, which means ""careful"" or ""heedful."" Cautious people always take their time, always approach decisions thoughtfully, and never ""throw caution to the wind."" All that wariness may sound tedious, but as Confucius said, ""The cautious seldom err.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1643,"<ul><li>When you confess, you admit to doing something wrong. You might feel guilty about eating the entire platter of chocolate chip cookies and confess to your mom before she notices. If she presses charges, you would confess to the cookie crime.</li><li>Confess can be used to describe admitting to committing a crime. If you watch crime shows on TV, you've likely seen detectives trying to get a suspect to confess. Confess can also be used in a religious context. Catholics confess their sins to a priest on a regular basis. Don't confuse the word confess with apology. An apology involves expressing regret about something. When you confess, you're merely owning up to doing it — you might not be sorry.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1644,"<ul><li>A cottage is a small house, particularly a traditional or old-fashioned house, or one that is used seasonally. Your family might rent a cottage near the beach every summer.</li><li>In the US, a cottage typically has only one story, while in Canada a house can be much larger and still be called a cottage. In the Middle Ages, a cottage was housing for farm workers — sometimes known as cottagers — and the word implied not just a home, but also a barn and land. The first US holiday cottages were built in the 1880s in Bar Harbor, Maine and are credited with introducing the word cottage to North America.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1645,"<ul><li>When the sun is lighting up the sky outside, it's daytime. Most adults are at work during the daytime and come home at nighttime.</li><li>While daytime is defined as ""after sunrise and before sunset,"" it describes this time of day even on dark, gray, days, or in parts of the world that get limited sunlight during the winter. A more accurate way to think of daytime is the hours after you wake up in the morning and before you start to think about going to bed at night. When it's daytime where you are, it's nighttime on the opposite hemisphere of the Earth.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1646,"<ul><li>Desperate means ""having lost all hope."" If you are desperate for food, it means you are starving, possibly about to die. If you are in a desperate situation, it means things are really, really bad.</li><li>Desperate, desparate, or despirate? The word desperate is misspelled often enough that it's the despair of English teachers. Both desperate and despair come from the same Latin verb as despair. Don't mix it up with disparate, a totally different word that means ""distinctive, different, various.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1647,"<ul><li>Something that's exhausting tires or fatigues you. An exhausting hike up the side of a mountain leaves you gasping for breath and so tired you need to sit down and rest.</li><li>Some things, like a rigorous workout or a difficult type of manual labor, are physically exhausting. Others are mentally exhausting, like a long argument with a friend or a tricky calculus exam. The adjective exhausting is rooted in the Latin exhaurire, ""draw off, take away, use up, or empty,"" which perfectly describes how you feel after an exhausting experience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1648,"<ul><li>When things fade, they gradually become less clear or more faint. When you wake up after having a strange dream, its details quickly begin to fade unless you write them down right away.</li><li>Dreams usually fade once you wake up, and sunlight begins to fade toward the end of the day. Sounds can fade too, as when the music you can hear from a passing car begins to fade as it moves down the road. Disappointments in life can make your hopes and dreams fade, and the smell of cut flowers will eventually fade as well. The Old French root word, fader, means ""weaken, wilt, or wither.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1649,"<ul><li>Fierce is ferocious and forceful, like a lion. When you are fierce, opponents fear you. Despite their loss, the talented JV team put up a fierce fight against the varsity squad.</li><li>Fierce comes from the Latin ferus 'wild animal.' It means strong, proud, dangerous and ready to roar. Fierce can also be used to mean intense. The family was known for their fierce pride. If you have a fierce work ethic, you don't rest until you finish the job. And a fierce storm can really devastate a community.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1650,"<ul><li>When you gamble, you take a risky chance on something. When an entrepreneur invests her own money in her business, she gambles on its success.</li><li>If you approach a stray dog, you gamble on its friendliness, and if you turn down a high-paying job to take a more interesting position, you gamble on it eventually paying off. Another way to gamble is to buy a lottery ticket or place a bet on a poker hand: when you gamble like this, you play a game of chance, risking some amount of money. Gamble is from Old English gammlen, ""to play, jest, or be merry.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1651,"<ul><li>A lawn is an area of ground that's planted with grass. Your next-door neighbor might be so overly proud of his tidy lawn that he stands on it, glaring at the dandelions growing in yours.</li><li>Most lawns are neatly mowed — a lawn that's allowed to grow tall might more accurately be called a field,  especially if there are weeds or wildflowers mixed in with the grass. It's difficult to grow a lawn in places that don't get much rain, since it needs to be watered regularly to stay green and lush. Lawn was laune in the 1500s, meaning ""open space between the woods,"" from the Old French lande, ""heath, moor, or clearing.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1652,"<ul><li>When you clip grass or other plants, you mow it. If you realize your front lawn is taller than your dog, it might be time to mow it.</li><li>People with grassy lawns usually mow them throughout the growing season, keeping them neatly trimmed and green. Farmers mow some food crops and hay as well, when they're ready to be harvested, although they use different tools to do it, including a curved blade called a scythe. An old-fashioned meaning of mow is ""a stack of hay,"" or ""a place where hay is stored.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1653,"<ul><li>An outlaw is a criminal who's on the run. Historically, the word outlaw was used for Western criminals like Billy the Kid or Jesse James, not so much for contemporary drug lords or serial killers.</li><li>Because they didn't need to be arrested by a police officer or other official, pursuing outlaws was once a way to earn reward money. The outlaw figure became popular due to the almost romantic image of nonconformity they had — outlaws are common characters in Western books and movies. You can also use outlaw to mean ""ban or make illegal."" If you had your way, you might outlaw spinach, long lines, and stinky perfume.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1654,"<ul><li>A prospect is the possibility that something fabulous will happen. After you graduate top of your class at Harvard, for example, your job prospects look great.</li><li>Prospect is from the Latin word  prospectus  which means a ""view or outlook."" A prospect is still a way of looking ahead and expecting good things. It's like potential in that it's something that might be but isn't yet. There is also the potential for something bad to happen, but prospects usually look good. In the 1800s, when men in floppy brown hats started saying ""There's gold in them there hills!"" the noun became a verb — to prospect is to search for gold. Either way, when you have prospects, you have a golden future.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1655,"<ul><li>Though purses are mostly carried by women, this is the kind of purse anyone would love to bring home: it's a prize, usually consisting of money.</li><li>The most common meaning of purse, as a woman's bag, can definitely help you remember the ""prize"" meaning of purse, because a woman who won a purse could carry her winnings in a purse. The non-bag type of purse is usually associated with sporting events: boxers and jockeys win purses. Other times, purse is used to describe money won in another context, like a photography contest. Another meaning is totally different: if you pucker or contract your lips, you're pursing them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1656,"<ul><li>A rod is a bar or a stick, like the curtain rods in your windows or the steel rods inside the structure of a building that help make it sturdy.</li><li>A rod can be a staff, like a walking stick, or a metal bar used in construction projects. In tarot card decks, rods are are a suit that's also known as ""wands"" or ""batons."" You fish with a rod too, a long flexible pole. Most parents today disagree with the old-fashioned saying, ""Spare the rod and spoil the child,"" which basically means ""your kid will be spoiled if you don't hit them with a stick now and then.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1657,"<ul><li>If you seldom see your grandmother because she lives far away, you might be grateful for the opportunity to visit her over the summer. Use the adjective seldom to refer to things that don't happen very often.</li><li>A near synonym is rarely. Seldom is a Middle English word, from Old English seldum, a spelling alteration of seldan ""strange, rare."" In Old English, the spelling seldum came about by analogy with forms such as Old English hwilum ""formerly, at one time,"" from hwil ""time, while.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U23_1659,"<ul><li>When you're terrified, you're so scared you can hardly move. Some people keep fuzzy spiders as pets, and others are truly terrified of them.</li><li>Certain situations cause almost anyone to be terrified: nearly falling off a tall building, seeing someone you love get very sick, or being chased down a dark alley by a lumbering monster. Other things that make you feel terrified might be your individual fears, such as speaking in public or riding in elevators. When you're terrified, you're full of terror, or a panicked fear. The root word is Latin, terrificare, which means ""to frighten.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U23_1660,"<ul><li>A wizard is a kind of magician. A wise man who can perform magic spells in a fairy tale or fantasy novel is often described as a wizard.</li><li>One of the most famous fictional wizards is Harry Potter, who first learns of his magical abilities when Hagrid says, ""Harry — yer a wizard."" Sometimes wizards are described as male versions of witches, while other stories use the term as a gender-neutral name for anyone with magical powers. Colloquially, you might call someone a wizard if they're truly amazing at what they do (even if it's not magic): ""She's a wizard at dog training!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1661,"<ul><li>If you study abroad in your junior year of college, you are going to school in another country. Use abroad when you are talking about going to or from a place across an ocean.</li><li>Abroad really just means in a different country, but it is almost always used interchangeably with ""overseas."" You almost never hear an American say, ""She lives abroad; she's studying in Canada."" You might be eager to take a trip abroad. If so, get your passport ready. They won't let you board a plane going abroad without one.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1662,"<ul><li>An airline is a company that owns and operates a fleet of planes. You might pick an airline for your trip to Hawaii based on who sells the least expensive tickets.</li><li>The airline is the business that maintains airplanes for commercial and business travel. Some people have a strong preference for one airline over another — you may enjoy flying with the airline that provides homemade cookies to its passengers, for example. Baggage handlers, flight attendants, and pilots all work for an airline. The original, 1813 meaning of airline was quite different: ""a straight line between two points on the earth's surface.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1663,"<ul><li>An audience can be people watching a performance, or an opportunity to speak with someone important, like an audience with your favorite actor at a ""meet and greet"" event.</li><li>The noun audience can describe all the people watching a performance, or the part of the general public interested in a specific type of information or entertainment. For example, the audience for a show about raising children might be parents or other care-givers. Finally, an audience can be a meeting or interview, like an audience with your school's principal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1664,"<ul><li>The table you bought at a yard sale for five dollars might seem like a bargain until you get it home and realize it only has three legs. A bargain is a good deal.</li><li>Inexpensive items are one type of bargain, and another kind of bargain is an agreement you make with someone — a deal or compromise. Two countries might strike a trade bargain, or you could make a bargain with your friend that you'll drive to the mall if she buys you a giant cinnamon roll. Bargain also means to negotiate the details of a purchase, which makes sense because the root word is bargaignier, French for ""haggle over the price.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1665,"<ul><li>Something brief is short and to the point. If you make a brief visit, you don't stay long. If you make a brief statement, you use few words. If you wear brief shorts, you are showing a little too much leg.</li><li>As a noun, a brief is a condensed summary or abstract, especially a legal summary of a case. Lawyers submit pretrial briefs to the court outlining the witnesses for the prosecution or defense. As a verb, brief means to give essential information to someone — like the President gets briefed on important matters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1666,"<ul><li>Currency is the paper and coin money that a country uses to conduct business. The United States uses a currency that's made up of dollars, quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies.</li><li>Just about every country has its own currency — the money its people use to pay for their groceries, clothes, and other goods. Paper currency in the United States is all green and can confuse people who use bills with different colors for different denominations. In addition to describing a country's monetary system, currency means something that is accepted or used. The slang word ""daddy-o"" was the currency in the 1950s, but people who say it today can expect to receive strange looks.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1667,"<ul><li>Data is information such as facts and numbers used to analyze something or make decisions. Computer data is information in a form that can be processed by a computer.</li><li>Data is the plural of Latin datum, ""something given."" In scientific use, the word data is often considered to be a plural noun meaning ""pieces of information"": The data are reliable. But most people think of data as a mass noun meaning ""information"" and use the word with a singular verb and pronoun: The data is reliable because it was tested by experts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1668,"<ul><li>Domestic generally means relating to someone's family, home, or home country. Domestic work is work done in the home — a domestic is someone who works in a home, such as a nanny or a maid.</li><li>Domestic is also used to refer to products that are produced in your country, or policies and affairs that relate to your country. And domestic animals, such as cats and dogs, are used to living with people. Domestic derives from Middle English, from Old French domestique, from Latin domesticus, from domus, ""house.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1669,"<ul><li>Draft means to draw, both in the sense of sketching an image onto paper, but also in terms of pulling — a draft horse draws a wagon, a draft of air is drawn into your lungs when you take a breath.</li><li>A cold draft is a current of cold air being drawn indoors. To draft someone into the army means to draw them into service, or make them serve. When you are drafting, or writing, a draft of a paper on the military draft in the U.S., you want to let your ideas flow freely. Then, in your next draft, you can work on filling in holes and edit the language down to what you really want to say.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1670,"<ul><li>Gather is a verb with many related meanings, most involving drawing together or assembling something. You may gather your socks into the laundry bag, or you may gather your thoughts by making a list.</li><li>Gather often is used to describe bringing people together for some purpose, like the students who gather in the hallway awaiting an announcement. Gather can also refer to an increase or gain, like when you gather speed and go faster on your bike. Gather can describe coming to a conclusion or an understanding. After listening to your brother's comments and watching him pack up his video games, you may gather that he isn't going to be around for dinner.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1671,"<ul><li>A hobby is an activity that you do in your spare time for fun. Your hobby may be putting together model train sets and driving your mom crazy from all the noise.</li><li>In the 13th century the word hobby referred to a small horse or a pony. It later came to describe a toy horse — a hobbyhorse. It’s from the hobbyhorse that the word’s modern sense of “favorite pastime” evolved. A hobby is something that you do for fun — not money — and you typically do it fairly regularly. Collecting stamps, growing roses, reading — any of these can be hobbies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1672,"<ul><li>What could be simpler than to remember that income basically refers to money that ""comes in,"" or is earned. Your income is the money you make in a given time period, for example weekly, monthly, or annually.</li><li>Your income might come from many sources — salary, investments, interest or annuities. Today income is used as a noun, but the Old English word incuman was first a verb that meant ""to come in,"" and referred to the money earned through one's labor or business dealings. The first income tax was attempted in Britain in 1404, but was so unpopular it was ended. In the United States, the Federal Income Tax became law in 1913, and, unfortunately, is still in effect.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1673,"<ul><li>A jet is an airplane that can rapidly travel long distances. To jet is the act of getting somewhere quickly, by jet or any other way, as in, ""Do you see what time it is? We better jet!""</li><li>A jet is an aircraft that gets its power from jet engines rather than propellers. Jets are fast — that's probably why as a verb, jet means ""to move quickly,"" either by taking a jet, like the celebrities who jet around the world, or the more ordinary ""if I don't jet, I'll be late for school."" Dishwashers and certain kinds of tubs have jets, tiny openings that push water out with great force. The streams of water are also called, you guessed it, jets.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1674,"<ul><li>Both a noun and an adjective, maximum takes it to the max: it means the most, the fastest, the biggest.</li><li>""The most you can have is the maximum"": that's the noun. In ""the maximum amount is the most you can have,"" it's used as an adjective. You might be familiar with the shortened version of the word: the ""max."" If you take something ""to the max,"" you're doing as much of it as possible. You take it to the limit. You take it to the maximum.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1675,"<ul><li>Official is the real deal. If you want the latest news from Graceland, check the official Elvis Presley website. But you’ll have to look elsewhere to find the unofficial, unapproved, and highly unlikely scoop on Elvis sightings.</li><li>If something is official, it's authorized and approved by somebody. If Gatorade is the official drink of the Olympics, somebody with authority has signed some papers and a deal has been made. When you're playing soccer or other sports, the official is the person who makes the calls; he referees (or officiates) the game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1676,"<ul><li>If you recommend a person or thing is to vouch for them. Recommend can also be to advise. If your doctor recommended an exercise program to you that's changed your life, you might recommend your doctor to your friends.</li><li>Recommend is connected to the verb commend ""to praise."" They are both spelled with one c and two m's, reflecting the prefixes re- and com-. These verbs overlap in some uses: you can  recommend or commend an applicant for employment. But commend is used for special or public praise: ""He was commended for bravery.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1677,"<ul><li>If you refer to something, you consult it. To check your spelling, you refer to a dictionary. If you want to know when your spring break starts, you can refer to your class schedule.</li><li>Refer is made up of two very useful Latin roots: re- ""back"" and ferre ""carry,"" and when one thing refers to another, one meaning “carries back” to the other — there’s some kind of connection. ""The term “Spaghetti Western” refers to a kind of Western often filmed in Italy by Italian filmmakers, in Italian."" If you have a mysterious rash, your doctor might refer you — send you — to an allergist.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1678,"<ul><li>Remote describes something far, far away, like a campsite way out in the woods, a distant planet, or the chance you'll win the lottery.</li><li>The Australian outback is remote, since it's hard to get to and there aren't many people there. It's also remote in the sense that it's far away from civilization. Someone with a faraway look in her eye, not answering your questions is also remote. Remote can describe something unlikely, like that lottery win. You might win, but your chances are so remote you shouldn't count on it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1679,"<ul><li>If something is sleepless, it's wakeful or restless, like a sleepless night spent in an unfamiliar house listening to spooky noises.</li><li>You might be sleepless the night before an exciting trip, or sleepless in your sleeping bag because the ground feels cold and hard beneath you. Whenever sleep won't come—because of worry, excitement, or discomfort—you can describe yourself (and the night) as sleepless. It's used in a literary way as well, to mean ""restless"" or ""constantly moving,"" like a sleepless willow tree swaying in the breeze.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U24_1680,<ul><li>Volume can mean how much space something takes up. You could measure a bean's volume by placing it in water and measuring the water's rise.</li><li>You can also use volume as you measure sound or the number of books in a series. Your mom might demand that you turn down the volume on your stereo as she reaches for the next volume of Dante's Divine Comedy. She would rather read about Hell in silence.</li></ul>
4000EEW_B03_U25_1681,"<ul><li>To circulate is to move continuously in a specific circuit, often in a circle. A ceiling fan circulates cool air around the room on a warm day.</li><li>Blood circulates through your body, pumped from your heart through veins and arteries — your circulatory system — and delivering oxygen to your tissues. This system is closed, meaning the blood stays in your body, bringing oxygenated blood back to your heart. People circulate when they move around a room at a party, chatting with different people, and rumors circulate when they're passed in a circle, from person to person. Circulate comes from the Latin circulare, ""to form a circle.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1682,"<ul><li>Something that happens as a result of something else can be described as consequent. Rapidly melting snow often causes consequent flooding, for example.</li><li>A politician might talk about raising the minimum wage and consequent improvements in workers' lives — in other words, she believes the positive changes for workers would be a direct result of higher minimum pay. One thing would follow the other. You're most likely to come across the adjective consequent in formal speech or writing. The Latin root word is consequi, ""to follow after.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1683,"<ul><li>If you want to talk about something that comes from something else, but you want to sound sophisticated and maybe financial or scientific, use derive, like so: That scent? It's derived from a solution of roses boiled with toothpicks.</li><li>The word derive derives from (see how we did that?) the Latin rivus or stream, as in water. That image of the stream may help you remember the meaning of derive; you may picture tracing tiny streams back to their main source. Derive is a verb, as you can see, but it's often in the news in the noun form derivative: something that is derived from something else, as in ""juice is a derivative of an orange.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1684,"<ul><li>The verb drown means to die from inhaling water into the lungs and being unable to breathe. It is possible to drown in even a small amount of water, so it's important to learn proper water safety.</li><li>You can also use this verb with a direct object: for example, a flash flood might drown animals that live near a river.  You can drown things in a less literal way as well. If you drink alcoholic beverages to forget your troubles, for example, you can say you're trying to ""drown your sorrows."" If you're submerged in a tidal wave of school assignments, then you are ""drowning in work.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1685,"<ul><li>A dynasty is a series of leaders in the same family, like the British Royal Family, or a local business dynasty, in which four generations have made their fortune at the family store.</li><li>The word dynasty, pronounced ""DIE-nas-tee,"" comes from the Greek word dynasteia, meaning ""power, lordship, sovereignty."" If you are part of a dynasty, you probably do have power — and also wealth, privilege. But there is also pressure to achieve as much as your parents, grandparents, and other relatives. Another kind of dynasty is found in sports — a team that wins many championships is a dynasty.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1686,"<ul><li>A fraction is a part of a whole. If two of you split the take from a bank heist, you would each get half. If you had a getaway driver, then the money would be split three ways, into fractions of one-third each.</li><li>The quotient of two numbers is called a fraction, as is the action of performing division. Most of us, however, think of a fraction as a small part of an item — as in: ""You only use a fraction of your actual brain power in the course of your life."" Just think of a whole as a pie, and a fraction as a slice of that pie.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1687,"<ul><li>Frost is a thin, icy coating that forms on very cold, damp nights. During a New England winter, you'll have to scrape frost off your car windshield almost every morning.</li><li>Frost is made of tiny crystals of ice that appear white and tend to form on windows, the ground, trees, and cars. While frost can be lovely on a window, with its snowflake shapes and patterns, it can also be dangerous for farm crops if it forms unexpectedly early or late in the year. Frost comes directly from the Old English, and it has a Proto-Germanic root.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1688,"<ul><li>An illusion is something that isn't real. It may look real, but it's actually fake — just a crafty construction or fantasy. Like the old rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick practiced by magicians around the globe.</li><li>An illusion is an act of deception. Some optical illusions are pretty cool to watch, but an illusion can also point to an erroneous belief or false perception of reality, which is where you start getting into hallucination territory — seeing things that aren't there. You can give the illusion that you’re fascinated by your professor’s lecture by chewing on your pencil, furrowing your brow, and making sure to nod enthusiastically every so often.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1689,"<ul><li>When you Invade, you aggressively take over or occupy a place. If a country's leader wants to gain more land, the military might invade a neighboring country.</li><li>Not everything that invades is militaristic. Some things that invade are cultural, such as the phenomena of young, stylish people moving into a neighborhood that had never been thought of as cool before. In an instant, new restaurants and shops catering to the newcomers open and soon the area is overrun with people wearing, say, skinny jeans and complicated eyewear. Natives to the area lament, ""This place has been invaded by hipsters.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1690,"<ul><li>A lieutenant is a commissioned officer in the armed forces or the police who can take command if her higher-ups aren't around.</li><li>Lieutenant is pronounced ""loo-TEN-unt."" If you're confused about all those vowels, blame the French, because the word comes from the French words lieu, meaning ""place,"" and tenant meaning ""holding."" A lieutenant is someone who holds the place of authority for the person who really has it. If you start a super secret club, you should choose someone to be the lieutenant who can run meetings when you're not there.</li></ul>"

Your friend in the U.S. Armed Services who is a Marine probably spends a lot of time near the ocean.</li><li>Marine life is everything that lives in the water: plants, fish, sharks, algae, crabs, seahorses, giant squid, and the list goes on and on. When you study things that live in or near the sea, you are either a marine biologist or just really excited about ocean life. If you work in a field that deals with the ocean, boats, sailors or the navy you could be, for instance, a marine meteorologist.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1692,"<ul><li>Merit means ""worthiness or excellence."" If you receive a certificate of merit in school, you are being recognized for doing a good job. As a verb, merit means ""deserve."" Your certificate might merit a prominent place on your bulletin board!</li><li>You will often hear the phrases ""merit-based promotion"" and ""merit-based pay,"" which come up when employees are pushing against a system in which time on the job — and not job performance — determines when workers are promoted and how much they are paid. Using the word merit suggests impartiality and objectivity — such as when you swear off a prejudiced approach to something and vow to ""judge it on its merits.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1693,"<ul><li>A navy is a military force made up of boats and ships that are equipped for defense and fighting. If you always get seasick, you might think about joining an army instead of a navy.</li><li>During a war, a country's navy does the important job of protecting its shores, as well as attacking the enemy's coasts. A navy is made up of battleships, submarines, and smaller vessels, as well as planes that can land on aircraft carriers or on water. The color that's also called navy, a dark blue, was the original color of the British navy. The Latin root of navy is navis, ""ship.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1694,"<ul><li>The idea of polar suggests equal opposites. For example, the North and South Poles are at opposite ends of the planet, and both are equally glacial, or very cold, which, by the way,  is another meaning of polar.</li><li>The English word polar derives from the Latin polus and the Greek polos, which means ""axis."" (See the connection with the North and South Poles?) The discovery of polar bears was first recorded in the mid-18th century, while the idea of ""polar opposites"" came about in 1832. The adjective polar is also used to describe something vitally important, an idea that came from the importance of Polaris, the North Star, which has always been a voyager’s guide.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1695,"<ul><li>A ray is a beam of light or radiation. Even on cloudy days, you sometimes see a ray of sunlight shine through the clouds.</li><li>In physics, a ray is a line or column of light, heat, or electromagnetic radiation (like an x-ray), while in math a ray is a line that passes through a specific point. A marine biologist would define a ray as a big fish that's related to sharks and has a wide, flat body and a long tail. The root of the first two kinds of rays is the Latin word radius, ""spoke"" or ""staff.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1696,"<ul><li>To resign is to quit or retire from a position. You can also resign yourself to something inevitable, like death — meaning you just accept that it's going to happen.</li><li>When people resign, they're leaving something, like a job or political office. Congressmen resign after a scandal. Coaches resign after a really terrible season. Regular folks simply resign when they're ready to go. In those cases, resign is a nicer way of saying quit. Being resigned is another sense of this word — it's a type of acceptance. If your team is losing 80-20, you might as well resign yourself to losing. That just means you aren't in denial.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1697,"<ul><li>Suicide is killing yourself on purpose, dying at your own hand.  Some people kill themselves by accident, but that’s not suicide, it’s just clumsy and unfortunate.</li><li>The word suicide breaks down into the Latin words sui and caedere, which together translate to “kill oneself.”  However, not all suicides are about the final end of life.  For example, a righteous politician can commit political suicide by speaking publicly about an unpopular topic.  We call a person who has killed himself a suicide, and a police report might tell how many suicides happen in a city each year.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1698,"<ul><li>To tremble is to quiver or shake without meaning to. Your hands probably tremble when you're nervous.</li><li>Trembling is a movement, but it's not one that anyone intends to make. Someone who is extremely scared or cold might tremble all over. Older people tend to tremble more often than younger people, sometimes because of serious disorders like Parkinson's disease. The root word of tremble is the Latin tremulus, ""trembling or tremulous."" Certain honey bees perform a wiggly, shivering movement called a ""tremble dance,"" which scientists believe inspires speedier nectar collection.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U25_1699,"<ul><li>The obvious meaning of underlying refers to something beneath something else. But the word carries a more subtle meaning, that of something hidden but important, something that shapes the meaning or effect of something else, without being explicit itself.</li><li>Consider the adjective underlying as referring to a ""subtext,"" which is something hidden. An example is sarcasm, when a person says one thing but means the opposite. In theater, an actor develops subtext for his or her character to establish an underlying reason for what that character says and does. Life is full of underlying reasons we do things. Worry over a grandparent's illness might be the underlying reason a child fails a test. (Then again, maybe she just didn't study.)</li></ul>"

It looked pretty much the same.</li><li>The verb alter can also mean to neuter or spay. Think of a cat that has just been spayed: the cat you pick up from the vet is the same cat that you dropped off there, only perhaps a little groggy and unable to reproduce. While the cat has been altered, it's not a different cat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1702,"<ul><li>If something's aside, it's not in the middle of things — it's off to the side, either literally or figuratively, as with the papers and books you push aside on the couch, to make room to sit.</li><li>When you ignore your conscience, you're pushing your best instincts aside. You can put money aside, to save it for the future. In a play, when an actor steps out of character and speaks directly to the audience, that's an aside. The expression ""all joking aside,"" means ""stop kidding around and get serious"" as in, ""All joking aside, you're not really going bungee jumping, are you?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1703,"<ul><li>Autumn is the season after summer, when leaves fall from trees. It's also the season when the days get shorter and colder, and everything turns brown and drab, but people like it anyway, for the cocoa and cider, probably.</li><li>Autumn is the third season of the year, coming after summer and before winter, and coinciding with the dropping of leaves from the trees as they go into a winter rest, which is why it's also called fall. We also use autumn metaphorically to talk about the seasons of a person's life, like that luminous older actress in the autumn of her career: she's not yet playing roles in nursing homes, but neither is she scampering around in bikinis.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1704,"<ul><li>If you blend red and blue, you get purple. To blend is to mix together thoroughly. If you put this color in your hair, you'll blend with the people at a punk rock concert!</li><li>Used as a noun, the word blend means the thing you mixed together or the act of mixing something together. Purple is a blend of red and blue. When you see this word, picture the blender on your kitchen counter. If you use it to give ice cream, fruit and fruit juice a blend, it'll mix things together well to make a very tasty blend.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1705,"<ul><li>To collapse means to fall over, cave in, or totally crumple. After finding out that the stock market has collapsed and your investments along with it, you'd probably collapse to the ground and sob uncontrollably.</li><li>From the Latin collapsus, meaning “fall together,"" comes our English collapse, a word that functions as both noun and verb. Empires collapse after revolutions, and your dog will eventually collapse from exhaustion if he keeps chasing his tail in circles. But if a company falls apart after the boss retires, or you have a total breakdown cramming for exams, that's a kind of collapse, too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1706,"<ul><li>When you crush something, you break it into tiny pieces or crumple it. If you crush the cans in your recycling bin, you'll make more room for more.</li><li>A train can crush a car that's stalled on the tracks, and a person can crush an insect between her fingers. A figurative meaning of crush is to subdue or stop, like when a military dictator's forces crush a rebel uprising. You can also use crush as a noun to mean ""an overwhelming number,"" like a crush of bodies on a packed subway car, or to describe infatuation, like your crush on your attractive neighbor, who also can be called your crush.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1707,"<ul><li>A curve is an arched or bent shape, like the curve of a smiling mouth or the curve of a road that twists and turns as you drive along the coast.</li><li>As a noun, a curve can be any shape that deviates from being perfectly straight. You can trace a curve on a graph, throw an arcing pitch in baseball called a curve ball, or just admire the curves of the rolling hills in the distance. And as a verb, curve means to make or form this non-straight shape: ""When she's happy, my dog's tail curves up over her back.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1708,"<ul><li>Something disgusting is awful in a way that makes you want to throw up — it's really, really yucky. Nobody likes disgusting things.</li><li>Stepping in dog poo is disgusting — in other words, revolting and gross. Some people think spiders are disgusting; others find meatloaf disgusting; it just depends on what your tastes and tolerances are. If a politician is caught taking bribes, people say ""That behavior is disgusting!"" If your favorite team loses 20 games in a row, that might seem disgusting. Pretty much anything horrible, terrible, or nasty can be called disgusting.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1709,"<ul><li>Most commonly found at the bottom of sinks and bathtubs across the globe, a drain is the hole through which water is carried away.</li><li>If it rains on the day you decided to go to the beach, you could say your plans went right ""down the drain."" When used as a verb, to drain means ""to gradually empty,"" whether it's a man-made lake that's got to go or some financial obligations putting a strain on your wallet. And that obnoxious guy who's sucking the life out of the party? He's a real drain too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1710,"<ul><li>To embrace something is to welcome it with open arms, hold, hug, accept completely. You might embrace your sweetheart, or even changes in technology.</li><li>Embrace is from the French verb embrasser, which started out meaning  ""to clasp in the arms"" (but now includes kissing). You embrace someone by giving her a giant hug, and when you embrace a new idea, it's like your brain gives it a hug. The noun and verb form are similar: If you embrace someone who isn't your sweetheart, you might get caught in an embrace. In Henry IV, Shakespeare writes about a really, really tight embrace: ""I will embrace him with a soldier's arm/That he shall shrink under my courtesy.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1711,"<ul><li>Wanting what someone else has and resenting them for having it is envy. If your best friend comes to school with the silver backpack you’d had your eye on all summer, you want to be happy for her, instead you feel bitter envy.</li><li>Envy comes from the Latin word invidere, which literally means “look upon.” You know when you say something funny or smart and someone gives you the evil eye? Envy all the way. Envy can be used as a noun or as a verb: Envy (noun) is the feeling you have when you envy (verb) what someone else has.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U26_1713,"<ul><li>Flour is a fine, powdery ingredient that's used to bake bread and cake and is made by grinding wheat or other grains. A traditional pound cake is made with a pound of flour.</li><li>You'll need flour when you bake almost anything, and while flour is usually made from wheat, you can also buy rice flour, corn flour, and may other kinds. When you sprinkle flour on the counter before kneading bread dough, you flour it. Flour comes from its homophone, flower, from the sense of ""the finest or loveliest part of the meal,"" just as a flower is the finest part of a plant.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1714,"<ul><li>A fuse is something that burns in order to ignite a bomb. Do you see anything near you that resembles a bundle of dynamite sticks with a fuse burning down? If so, stop reading this and GET OUT OF HERE!</li><li>Figuratively, if you say that someone has a short fuse, it means they get angry easily. If someone gets so angry they lose their temper, you can say that they blew a fuse. But this comes from another meaning of fuse — a device that interrupts the flow of electrical current so the system doesn’t get overloaded. If you use the toaster, microwave and dishwasher at the same time, you might literally blow a fuse. As a verb, if two things fuse, they blend or stick together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1715,"<ul><li>Ginger is a plant with a thick root that's used to spice food. You can make homemade ginger ale using grated ginger.</li><li>Ginger is an important spice all over the world, appearing in things like ginger beer, ginger bread, many Indian dishes, Chinese food, and ginger tea. Since ginger is native to South Asia, it's most commonly found in countries on that continent. Many people use ginger as a home remedy or medicine, as well as a food. In Britain, and increasingly in the US, it's common to describe red hair as ginger.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1716,"<ul><li>If you're jealous of someone, you want what they've got. This is one of the most basic human emotions, and it is not pretty. Don't be jealous of my good looks: you're cute too.</li><li>Being jealous is among the least attractive things you can be. The word jealous is actually derived from a Middle English word related to zealous, which means emotionally intense. It conveys a sense of emotional pain at someone else's good fortune. Jealousy is a close cousin of envy, but it can also mean ""fiercely guarding"" — as in ""I am jealous of the little money I've managed to make, so I'm not likely to blow it on a cheap toy.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1717,"<ul><li>Paste is like glue. If you paste something, you stick it onto something else. You might copy and paste info from one document to another on your computer, or literally paste posters all over town. Just don’t use tomato paste.</li><li>Some foods take the form of a paste, like cake frosting or pâté. There's also the kind of paste you can use for gluing paper — like wallpaper paste, for example. Costume jewelry, which resembles gemstones but is relatively inexpensive, is made from another, harder kind of paste. To paste something is to stick it together, to patch it, or to cover it with paper. The Late Latin root is pasta, or ""dough.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U26_1718,"<ul><li>You know that slim, white piece of paper the grocery store clerk gives you that lists everything you bought, how much you paid, and the change you received? That's a receipt.</li><li>A receipt is proof you bought and paid for something. At most stores, you need it if you're going to return what you bought. People collect receipts on business trips, so their employers will pay them back for what they purchased while away. Less commonly, receipt can be used as a verb, as in, ""The clerk receipted my purchases,"" meaning that the clerk gave written proof that the items were paid for.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U26_1720,"<ul><li>A thin piece of metal that you can bend is a wire. Wire is used for carrying phone signals and electricity, and also to make Slinky toys and abstract sculptures. If you wear braces, you might even have wire in your mouth.</li><li>Most wire is a tubular strand of metal, like the wire in jewelry or in the fence around your chicken coop. There's also braided wire coated in protective plastic to make cables for connecting electronic equipment or transmitting signals. In the old days, you might've sent a wire, or telegram, to a friend. And if you wear a wire, that's a secret recording device. As a verb, wire originally meant ""adorn with gold wire."" Today it means ""install wires"" like when you wire a new house for electricity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1721,"<ul><li>To show that you know something is to acknowledge it. Waving ""hello"" to acknowledge a friend and nodding your head ""yes"" to acknowledge that you agree with what's being said are both acts showing knowledge or acceptance of someone or something.</li><li>Dictionaries acknowledge that the word acknowledge has roots in the 15th and 16th centuries and is a combination of roots meaning ""accord,"" ""recognize,"" and ""understand."" Whereas ""knowledge"" is what you know, acknowledging is showing that you know. You might acknowledge that the world is round and that the moon is not made of cheese. You also can acknowledge, or give recognition, to the people who discovered these truths.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1722,"<ul><li>An ambassador is an official representative for his or her country, stationed in another nation, like Benjamin Franklin, who was an ambassador to France.</li><li>Ambassador usually describes the official diplomatic envoy who represents one country to another. These ambassadors work to promote understanding, perhaps by settling differences or clearing up misunderstanding. Used less formally, an ambassador can be anyone who represents something, like a pop singer who is a ""brand ambassador"" for a cosmetics company.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1723,"<ul><li>Blonde (with an ""e"" at the end) is usually used to describe the yellowish-colored hair of a female. Marilyn Monroe had famously blonde hair, but only from bleaching — she was naturally a brunette.</li><li>Marilyn Monroe's hair was so famous she actually starred in a movie called Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. There the noun blonde is used to mean a person (a woman) with light-colored hair and skin. So you can either say, “She is blonde,"" or “She is a blonde,” and they mean the same thing — that she has fair hair. When describing a male's yellowish hair or light-colored stained wood, you will more often see blond without the silent ""e"" at the end. The addition of the ""e"" in the feminine form of blonde is of course a holdover from its French origin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1724,"<ul><li>To conquer is to  defeat someone or something, usually with force, like army troops that conquer enemy territory, or your lunchtime hunger which you conquer with a sandwich and cup of soup.</li><li>To correctly pronounce conquer, accent the first syllable: ""CON-kur."" It comes from the Old French word conquerre, meaning ""defeat, vanquish."" Use conquer to show you've gained control over something, like doing breathing exercises as the airplane takes off to help you conquer your fear of flying. You'll hear people say they've conquered Mount McKinley, or the Appalachian Trail. It means they've hiked and climbed the whole route, not declared the place theirs alone.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1725,"<ul><li>To drag something means to physically pull it, like when you drag your sofa to the other side of the living room in order to get a better view of the TV.</li><li>Drag can also mean to prolong something. In this case, drag is often followed by the words ""out"" or ""on."" You could describe a class that drags on for hours, or try to drag out your homework to get out of doing the dishes. You can also drag someone unwillingly into a discussion or other situation. Anything that's boring and tedious can also be called a drag — like lunches with your great aunt Martha or cleaning the bathroom.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1726,"<ul><li>When you exaggerate you stretch the truth. Fishermen tend to exaggerate the size of their fish. And children tend to exaggerate the seriousness of their cuts in order to get cute Band-Aids.</li><li>We all have a tendency to exaggerate. It makes our stories funnier, or more dramatic. After all, when you exaggerate, you're not really lying — you're just overstating things. The word exaggerate can also suggest that a particular characteristic is overdone or almost larger than life. If you describe someone as having an exaggerated limp, he or she might be walking like a gorilla.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1727,"<ul><li>Heritage can refer to practices or characteristics that are passed down through the years, from one generation to the next. Researching your family tree would help you gain a sense of your personal heritage.</li><li>Heritage is often used to discuss a cultural aspect or tradition that has been passed down through generations. For example, one might speak of an area’s ""rich musical heritage.” Heritage can also refer to a person's ethnic or cultural background. In a legal sense, heritage is property that you inherit, like a silver teapot your great aunt Sally left to you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1728,"<ul><li>If you insult someone, you have offended that person — either intentionally or unintentionally — through your actions or words. You might insult your host if you refuse to try the dessert he made from pasta, nuts, and chocolate sauce.</li><li>As a noun, an insult means rude words or actions. If you tell the umpire he needs glasses, then you've made a verbal insult. If, after the umpire calls your team out, you make an obscene gesture in his general direction, you've made another kind of insult. Either insult can potentially get you thrown out of the game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1729,"<ul><li>Use the adverb meanwhile to mean ""at the same time."" For example, you might have a great evening at the bowling alley, but meanwhile, your parents are home wondering why you never showed up for dinner.</li><li>The word meanwhile is handy when you’re telling a story because sometimes it’s funny to realize what two things are happening at the same time. You might be frantically searching for your cat, meanwhile, he's lounging under your bed. Meanwhile can also refer to the time before something happens, as in ""I have an interview in an hour, but meanwhile I'm going to take a nap."" The word meanwhile is rooted in mean, with its meaning of ""middle"" or ""intermediate.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1730,"<ul><li>A necklace is jewelry you wear around your neck. You might decide your sparkly faux-diamond necklace is a bit dressy for your cousin's baseball game — but perfect for a fancy dinner out.</li><li>A necklace can be a simple gold or silver chain, a length of beads or gems, or a pendant hanging from a cord. As long as it's worn around the neck, it's a necklace. The word, which dates from the late 1500s, combines neck with lace, meaning ""cord,"" from the Old French laz, ""string, cord, or snare."" The Latin root, laqueum, means ""noose or snare.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1731,"<ul><li>A noble is a titled peer of the realm or an aristocrat. As an adjective, noble describes someone with high or elevated character, or who is impressive in appearance.</li><li>From feudal times, we have known nobles as the heirs to thrones or as the holders of aristocratic title. British aristocracy, for example, produces many people of various noble titles, including dukes, earls, princes, kings, and queens. As various royal histories tell us, however, many of these nobles in title weren't quite so noble in character.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1732,"<ul><li>To call something precious is to describe it as highly valued. Think of a gemstone when you call your baby sister precious.</li><li>Diamonds, emeralds and rubies are all precious stones and gold and silver are precious metals. If it is something valuable and treasured, it can be called precious too. Fresh water is a precious resource especially in desert countries. Many precious books and painting have been destroyed through fire and war. On a more personal note, guard your memories as they will always be precious to you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1733,"<ul><li>If you have a negative attitude towards someone based on race or ethnicity rather than personal experience, you might be accused of prejudice.</li><li>Prejudice is remarkably similar to its Latin root in form and meaning; the Latin praejudicium means ""judgment in advance."" A racial prejudice is a negative attitude towards a group of people based on race — not on direct knowledge or experience. If you prejudice someone, you cause them to have a negative attitude towards someone else. Lawyers are not allowed to bring certain types of evidence such as rumors into a trial because it might prejudice the jury.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1734,"<ul><li>A rumor is a story which may not be true. Everyone may be talking about the rap superstar who stopped for ice cream in your town, but until there's proof that it really happened, the whole thing is just a rumor.</li><li>Are rumors ever true? Of course — sometimes word gets out ahead of time, like when a student overhears teachers talking about the early dismissal before it is announced. When the school closes early, the rumor is confirmed. But many other rumors can never be confirmed, so they stay just that, rumors. True, false, semi-true: who knows? 
The Latin word rumorem, or noise, is the origin; noise is often all that a rumor is.</li></ul>"

Get on top of your desk at work in your underpants while playing the kazoo and you're making a spectacle of yourself.</li><li>The word spectacle comes from the Latin spectaculum meaning ""public show,"" an apt translation because a spectacle, like a public show, is something worth watching. A ballet is a spectacle, or an elaborate production worth watching. Often the word is used to describe something that has a particularly exciting visual element to it — like an acrobatic display or a magic trick. It's something you have to see to really appreciate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1737,"<ul><li>A stack is a tidy pile, like the stack of books on your nightstand or the stack of pancakes on your plate at breakfast. You can also use stack as a verb meaning ""to arrange in piles.""</li><li>If you stack the dollar bills you earned from your lemonade stand, you'll eventually have a stack of dollar bills. Unlike the similar word pile, stack implies a neat, orderly bundle, rather than a messy, haphazard one. When someone ""stacks the deck,"" they cheat in order to achieve the outcome they want—sometimes literally, by arranging a deck of cards unfairly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1738,"<ul><li>Suspicious behavior inspires distrust. Prancing around your backyard in a trench coat and fake mustache during daylight might elicit weird looks from your neighbors; do it at night, though, so that your silhouette glides past their windows, and what appeared innocent enough hours before will quickly transition to suspicious.</li><li>Use this adjective to describe a behavior or event that arouses doubt or mistrust. How to avoid appearing suspicious? Well, for one, stop pausing mid-conversation to take covert notes in that little journal of yours. And two, don’t wear sunglasses indoors, and don’t try to walk without making a sound. That will make people cagey, which is a synonym for suspicious.  Other synonyms include apprehensive, doubtful, wary, and watchful.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U27_1739,"<ul><li>Tin is a kind of metal that is soft and silver-colored. The most common use of tin today is in solder, the hot, liquid metal that holds pipes and other metal pieces together.</li><li>You may think of common items like tin foil and tin cans when you contemplate the uses of tin. Actually, so-called tin cans and tins are made of steel or other metals that are coated in tin. Before the middle of the 20th century, the foil used for covering food was made of thin sheets of tin. It was stiffer than today's foil (which is made of aluminum), and left food with a metallic, ""tinny"" taste.</li></ul>"

Thanks for the enormous bouquet of daisies — I'll need to find a large enough vase to fit them in!</li><li>A vase is a glass or ceramic container that serves only a decorative function — in other words, you're unlikely to serve a guest a big glass of lemonade in a vase. Vases are generally tall and narrow, to accommodate flower stems. Some vases are curvy and others are straight. In North America, vase usually rhymes with ""face,"" which was its original English pronunciation, though modern British speakers say it so it rhymes with ""blahs"" instead.</li></ul>"

An ache in your calves after your morning jog might mean you didn't stretch enough before you started running.</li><li>You might describe your discomfort as a head ache or a stomach ache — in either case, there's a throbbing or continuous pain. A non-physical hurt can also be called an ache, and you can use the word as a verb in either case: ""It feels like my heart will ache forever, since my sweet cat died."" The Old English root is acan, ""to suffer pain,"" possibly from an imitative Proto-Indo-European word that sounds like a groan.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1742,"<ul><li>If the weatherman warns of arctic conditions, get out your thermal underwear, hats, and gloves. It's going to be cold. The word arctic describes frigid and inhospitable weather.</li><li>The word arctic refers to the Arctic Circle — the North Pole and the land that surrounds it — which is the northernmost major circle of latitude on the Earth. When you think of the word arctic, imagine the weather at the North Pole, cold and windy, suitable only for hearty animals and mythical toy-making elves. Bundle up for the arctic blast heading down from Canada towards the U.S.!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1743,"<ul><li>A canal is a long, man-made strip of water used for irrigation or boat access to a bigger body of water, like the famous Erie Canal, which connects the Hudson River to Lake Erie.</li><li>Canal is related to the word channel, and all its different shades of meaning have to do with tunnel shaped spaces that carry liquid from one place to another. Besides man-made irrigation canals, canals that connect boat docks to rivers and oceans, or street-like canals in boat cities like Amsterdam, there are canals in your body, like your nasal canal, or the birth canal you came out of. It's also a verb meaning ""to dig a canal.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U28_1745,"<ul><li>A sharp burst of cold air or icy temperatures is a chill. The chill of a January day in New England might make you dream of moving to New Mexico.</li><li>You'll feel a chill when someone opens a window in the winter, or notice a chill in the air on a cool day in September. Another kind of chill makes you shiver, but it's caused by illness and fever rather than a cold breeze: ""Symptoms of the flu include chills and headache."" A cold attitude is also a chill, as when a chill in the room makes you realize your friends are angry at each other.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1746,"<ul><li>A congress is a formal meeting where people come together to discuss issues or questions. It often refers to the legislative branch of a nation's government, such as the US Congress, but it can also refer to any important meeting or official organization.</li><li>While the word congress inevitably brings to mind the governing Congress with a capital C, there are many different kinds of congresses. The potato farming community, for example, convened the first World Potato Congress in 1993, and the United States Bowling Congress formed in 1995 when the men's and women's bowling organizations joined forces. Congress comes from the Latin congressus, which fittingly means both ""friendly meeting"" and ""hostile encounter.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1747,"<ul><li>A dairy is a farm that specializes in milk and products made from milk. Cheese, yogurt, cream, and ice cream are all things that might be produced at a dairy.</li><li>While one kind of dairy is a farm where cows or goats are kept and milked, other dairies focus only on making products from milk that farmers sell to them. These items themselves can also be called dairy products. Dairy comes from the Middle English daie, ""dairy,"" which is rooted in the Old English dæge, ""kneader of bread,"" or ""female servant.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1748,"<ul><li>In its simplest sense, descend means to go or move downward, but there are a couple of subtle variations on this theme. Yes, a bird can descend from the sky, but also, humans are descended from prehistoric ancestors.</li><li>If you've ever heard a pilot say ""prepare for our descent"", then you know that only one letter separates the noun descent from the verb descend. They both derive from the same Latin components de, meaning ""down,"" and scandere, ""to climb."" Similarly, if someone condescends to you, they are said, derogatorily, to be coming down to your level.
All Americans are descended from peoples from other continents, such as Europe, Africa, and Asia. We've all ""come down"" from our ancestors.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1749,"<ul><li>Someone who sells food in a supermarket or convenience store is a grocer. If you can't find your favorite kind of cereal on the shelf, you should ask the grocer to help you.</li><li>The owner or manager of a grocery store is a grocer. This word once meant ""one who buys and sells in gross,"" or in large quantities, from the Anglo-French grosser. By the 16th century, grocer also meant ""merchant selling food,"" but earlier that person would've been called a spicer. Your neighborhood grocer might sell fresh produce from local farmers, unlike that big box supermarket out by the mall.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1750,"<ul><li>To hesitate is to pause before doing something, often out of concern or worry.</li><li>If you're playing basketball and have a wide-open shot but don't take it right away, you hesitated. Maybe you felt too much pressure to shoot the ball. When people are nervous or worried, they tend to hesitate. Hesitating while speaking is common. In class, if you're not sure you have the right answer, you'll hesitate. When giving bad news, people often hesitate. Sometimes it makes sense to hesitate and sometimes you just need to do what you have to do.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1751,"<ul><li>Universities, banks, and hospitals are all institutions. Until you arrived at the bank, you'd forgotten that financial institutions were closed for the holiday.  Thank goodness for the ATM!</li><li>The noun institution also refers to a long held custom or practice in society. Even if your parents divorced when you were young, you might strongly believe in the institution of marriage.  Or you might believe that once you enter the institution of marriage, your next stop will probably be a mental institution.  Institution can also describe the act of putting something in place.  The institution of new traffic rules — green means stop and red means go — caused a bit of confusion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1752,"<ul><li>When you jog, you run at a moderate pace, usually to get exercise. If you jog down the street, you'll pass people who are walking and be passed by people who are sprinting.</li><li>Jog can be a verb, or a noun meaning a slow-paced run: ""She moved at a lazy jog around the track, in no hurry to improve her time."" A jog is slower than a flat-out run. Yet another way to use the word is to mean ""nudge one's memory."" A courtroom attorney might hold up a piece of evidence in front of a witness and say, ""Perhaps this will jog your memory.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1753,"<ul><li>A merchant is someone who works in or owns a retail business and sells goods. In Paris you can stroll from merchant to merchant, buying a loaf of bread in one shop and a wedge of cheese in another.</li><li>The noun merchant has its Latin roots in the word merchari, meaning to trade. Other words from the same root include ""market,"" ""merchandise,"" and ""mercantile."" In some areas, independent merchants have banded together to combine advertising dollars and compete against malls and big box stores. You should ask your neighborhood book merchant if they've considered joining a group like this.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1754,"<ul><li>A poke is a jab or a sharp push, usually with something thin or pointed, like a finger, a stick, or even an elbow.</li><li>The main idea behind a poke is a prodding action that creates a depression or hole, as when you poke someone in the ribs with your finger. It can also mean a quick, sharp movement, like when a turtle  pokes its head out of its shell. Still, the word often has a less-than-pleasant feeling to it, like something not really dangerous but still annoying. We often say a tolerable experience is ""better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick."" It can also take on a more figurative meaning — when you ""poke your nose into someone else's business,"" it means that you are intruding in another's private matters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1755,"<ul><li>To postpone something is to put it off until later. You can postpone an appointment today and reschedule it for tomorrow.</li><li>Anything you're putting for is being postponed: people postpone things they don't have time to do or just don't want to do. Since doctor and dental appointments are no fun, people postpone them a lot. You can postpone small things, like going to the store or watching a video. The government can postpone big things, like the passing of bills or the invasion of another country. People who procrastinate are constantly postponing. When you see the word postpone, think ""Later!""</li></ul>"

You might, for example, prefer your coffee with just a splash of cream.</li><li>A splash can be wet, like a splash of lemonade in your tea, or it can be bright, like a splash of yellow across the oil painting you're working on. You can also use splash as a verb, as when you splash your sunbathing brother with swimming pool water. Splash first appeared in the early 1800's as a variation on the word plash, which had the same meanings and is most likely imitative — in other words, it sounds like its meaning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1757,"<ul><li>Use the adjective stubborn to describe someone who is not open to new ideas or ways of doing things, like your uncle who refuses to listen to any music made after 1990. Stubborn is the opposite of flexible.</li><li>The Middle English version of stubborn carried the sense of “untamable, implacable,” and there’s still a hint of that in how it is used today. A stubborn person holds on to a view or an attitude, refusing to change — to the point of being unreasonable. Things can also be stubborn, like a stain that no amount of scrubbing can clean or a medical condition that, even with treatment, doesn't improve.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1758,"<ul><li>A suburb is a residential district located on the outskirts of a city. If you live in the suburbs, you probably travel to the city for work.</li><li>Suburb comes from Latin: sub means ""below or near"" and urbis means ""city."" You also will recognize this root in urban. Suburbs have more single-family homes than apartment buildings, and living there, you are more likely to have a yard with trees and grass. The downside is, if you work in the city, you might have a long commute that adds to the time you are away from your family.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1759,"<ul><li>The tide is the daily rise and fall of the sea level. You can count on the regular changing patterns of the tide, unless of course a tsunami is headed your way.</li><li>In a figurative sense, tide can mean a rising swell of support or unified feeling about a certain opinion or topic. So you may surf at high tide but also enjoy the rising tide of enthusiasm about surfing. If there is a wave of anything — immigration, inflation, terror — it can be referred to as a tide. No surfboards can navigate those tricky waves.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U28_1760,"<ul><li>Tragedy is a noun that indicates disaster or bad fortune. It would be a tragedy to lose your job, but an even greater tragedy to fall ill while unemployed and without health care.</li><li>First recorded in the late 14th century, the noun tragedy originally referred to a play with an unhappy ending. About a century later it also came to mean an unhappy event or a disaster.  The playwright George Bernard Shaw wittily observed, ""“There are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart's desire. The other is to gain it.”  The comedian Mel Brooks defined tragedy as follows: ""Tragedy is when I cut my finger.  Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.""</li></ul>"

Your most prized possession might be the certificate you got when you became a black belt in karate.</li><li>Your fastidious friend might need to check the health inspection certificate before she'll agree to eat in a restaurant, and you'll need a copy of your birth certificate before you can apply for a passport. A certificate certifies or documents the fact that you are who you say you are, that you're licensed to drive, or authorized to practice dentistry, for example. You can trace the word certificate back to the Latin certus, ""sure, fixed, settled.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B03_U29_1764,"<ul><li>The long wooden box in which a dead body is kept for burial or cremation is called a coffin. At a graveside funeral, you'll see the coffin lowered into a grave.</li><li>Most coffins are made of wood, though they can also be steel, fiberglass, or bamboo. A coffin is generally thought of as the same thing as a casket, although some people distinguish between a six-sided coffin and a four-sided casket. The earliest meaning of coffin, from the 14th century, was ""box for valuables,"" from the Latin cophinus, ""basket or hamper,"" and the Greek root kophinos, ""a basket.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1765,"<ul><li>If you are able to cope with something, you are able to deal with it. If you can cope with waiting in long lines, you'll get the best seats. If you can cope with the stress, you will be excellent at defusing bombs.</li><li>From the Old French couper, cope means “come to blows with."" Coping can imply struggle, but it’s usually met with success or at the very least, not failure. Another word to describe the balancing act of a mother who takes care of three children while also working part-time and pursuing a graduate degree is coping. “Understanding does not cure evil, but it is a definite help, inasmuch as one can cope with a comprehensible darkness,” warns Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1766,"<ul><li>If you dye your hair bright blue, you're likely to get some criticism from people who just don't understand your personal style. When you're on the receiving end of criticism, you are being judged in a disapproving way.</li><li>The noun criticism is most often used to describe negative commentary about something or someone, but it's just as correct to use criticism to mean ""an examination or judgment."" Critics who review books and movies consider their reviews to be criticism, whether they're positive or negative. So the criticism you receive doesn't have to be all about your faults; it can actually be a pleasant experience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1767,"<ul><li>If a storm devastates your town, it comes pretty close to destroying it. To devastate is to cause destruction to or overwhelm.</li><li>Really bad news can devastate a person, or leave them devastated. They are so upset, they feel crushed. A basketball team can devastate an opponent by running roughshod over their defense. The root of the word is the Latin vastare which means to lay waste, which comes from vastus meaning desolate or empty. Imagine a city laid waste after a major earthquake and you've got the picture!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1768,"<ul><li>If you frown at someone, you look at them with disapproval, and if you frown on something they do, you don't approve of that either. Because you frown on smoking, you probably frown at smokers too!</li><li>The distant ancestors of frown, the ones that came long before Old French, meant ""nose."" Think about the expression, to look down one's nose at someone or something, which means ""to disapprove of."" If you have a frown on your face, you definitely don't like what you see! Sometimes when you're thinking hard about something, you might frown, but that is probably more of an expression of concentration than disapproval.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1769,"<ul><li>When someone lays eyes on you and keeps looking, it is a gaze or a stare. You can gaze back or just say, ""Take a picture; it lasts longer.""</li><li>Gaze is both a verb and a noun. When people daydream, they often gaze off into the distance without focusing on anything. Another type of gaze, though, is to look very intently at something, as when you gaze at the sky making pictures out of clouds. A contest to see who will blink first means taking a long gaze into someone's eyes, and this type of gaze (the noun) will leave your eyes in a bit of a haze when you're done.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1770,"<ul><li>Glance involves quick contact. When you glance at someone you take a quick peek at them. When a knife blow glances off you, it doesn't penetrate, but hits at an angle.</li><li>When you glance at someone, it's often because you don't want to be caught staring. Remember: ""Strangers in the night/exchanging glances..."" In certain circles, if someone is caught glancing at someone else's girlfriend, he'll find himself in a fist fight, praying only that his beefy opponent will deliver only a glancing blow.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1771,"<ul><li>Grief means intense sorrow. You feel grief if something terribly sad happens, like if your dog dies or if your childhood sweetheart breaks up with you.</li><li>The word grief comes from the Latin word gravare, which means to make heavy. Gravare itself comes from the Latin word gravis, which means weighty. So think of grief as a heavy, oppressive sadness. We associate it most often with mourning a loved one's death, but it can follow any kind of loss.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1772,"<ul><li>To groom means to take care of the appearance, whether it's plucking eyebrows or combing hair. When you spend over an hour grooming in the bathroom, combing your mustache and buffing your nails, you drive everyone else who needs to use the bathroom crazy.</li><li>You can groom something besides a person. Resorts groom their golf courses and ski runs. If you own a horse, you groom it every day. Animals groom each other by picking off insects and licking at fur. You can also use groom in regards to the mind. If you are being groomed for a certain spot or position, you are being prepared to take over its activities and responsibilities. Let's hope that you will someday be groomed for a spot on an executive board. And last but not least, the man getting married at a wedding is the groom.</li></ul>"

If you’re in England, the noun ends in “c,” as in driver’s licence.</li><li>When you have a license, you have official permission to do something, like drive a car. Bars need a liquor license to serve alcohol. Doctors need a medical license to practice medicine. You can also say people have license to do something, which means they're free to do it, like if you give yourself poetic license to misspell your own name. In Britain, license is only a verb, meaning ""allow,"" and the noun form is spelled with two cs: licence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1774,"<ul><li>A microscope is a mechanical instrument that magnifies the image of small objects. You would use a microscope to look at something tiny, like an amoeba.</li><li>First used in the 1650s, microscope is descended from the Modern Latin microscopium, meaning ""an instrument for viewing what is small."" In science, microscopes are essential for examining material that can't be seen with the naked eye, like bacteria and viruses. In the same vein, you might feel like you're ""under a microscope"" if you're being very closely observed and scrutinized, like a star in the limelight or a politician in front of the media.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1775,"<ul><li>Nuclear describes something that has to do with the nucleus — the central part — of an atom. If you're a nuclear physicist, you do a lot of work with that part of the atom.</li><li>Nuclear power, which comes from nuclear fission — the energy released when the nucleus of an atom is split — is a controversial source of renewable energy. The word nuclear is sometimes used broadly to refer to the core of something. Your nuclear family is you, your parents, and your siblings — in a sense, the central part of your world, kind of like the nucleus of an atom.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1776,"<ul><li>When you paint a picture of someone, either in words or in paint, you portray them. Actors portray characters too.</li><li>Whether you're talking about acting or another art form, the idea is the same: representing a person and bringing to light their most important qualities. To portray a person is to show who that person is, giving a sense of their personality or character. Often, famous people don't like how they're portrayed. For example, Presidents usually hate how they're portrayed in editorial cartoons. When you portray someone, you can be positive or negative, accurate or inaccurate. It's up to you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1777,"<ul><li>Rotate means to circle around a center point. Wheels on a car rotate, planets rotate, and if you're an ice skater, you rotate on the blade of a skate when you do your spins.</li><li>Rotate can also mean that you take turns performing a job. If you, Jim, and Shelia all got the same amount of votes in the class election, you could rotate the role of treasurer, meaning the position would pass from one to another in a regular pattern. Rotate can also refer to other things that are passed along in a regular order. You might rotate lawn duties with your brother — that means you mow the lawn one week and he mows it the next.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1778,"<ul><li>A souvenir is a keepsake or a remembrance. A telltale sign that someone has visited Paris is the tiny, metal Eiffel Tower hanging from her keychain as a souvenir.</li><li>First recorded in 1775 as meaning “a remembrance or memory,” the noun souvenir stems from the French souvenir “to remember, come to mind.” A few years later, it took on the sense of “a token” of an event or experience. A song by Tears for Fears goes, “Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.” Here, souvenir refers to a feeling, but more often it refers to something tangible, like a memento, gift, or trophy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1779,"<ul><li>If you're in the Navy, a submarine is a military ship that goes under the water. If you're hungry, it's a type of sandwich.</li><li>This word mainly refers to a vessel that travels underwater and is armed with torpedoes — also known as a U-boat. But you can submarine someone by attacking them with a submarine or bringing them down with a blow to the legs. A disappointment can submarine — or sink — your hopes and dreams. In the kitchen, a submarine is what you call a long, crusty sandwich filled with meats and cheese — also known as a sub, grinder, hero, or hoagie.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U29_1780,"<ul><li>A trace of something is just a hint or suggestion of it, a very small amount left behind — like the sad cookie crumbs at the bottom of an empty cookie jar.</li><li>There are more meanings we can trace to this word trace. As a verb, trace means to follow the course or trail of something, sometimes even chasing or hunting it. It also means to draw or sketch over a picture on translucent ""tracing paper."" So you could say that Sherlock Holmes traced criminals throughout London, following even the smallest traces of evidence and tracing copies of the villain's notes for his files.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1781,
4000EEW_B03_U30_1782,"<ul><li>Deter means to discourage, or literally “to frighten away.” Halloween decorations that are too scary might deter trick-or-treaters, and the risk of being expelled deters kids from cheating in school.</li><li>Deter comes from the Latin de meaning ""away"" and terrere meaning ""frighten."" Something that deters isn’t always scary, though: citronella plants deter mosquitoes, and fines deter people from littering. Teddy Roosevelt's foreign policy dictum ""speak softly and carry a big stick"" was meant to deter other countries from attacking the United States.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1783,"<ul><li>To devise is to figure out a plan. Men twirling long mustaches might devise a plan to tie someone to the railroad tracks.</li><li>To devise a plan is more than just making one; there's a lot of figuring out to do, such as: ""Phoebe devised a bus route that picked up kids in alphabetical order."" There's a method to the madness of devising. The chemistry class devised a plan to make the fire alarm go off. Devise can be positive, too, meaning to find a creative solution: ""The design team devised a plan to make the trailer home look like a medieval castle.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1784,"<ul><li>Distance is an amount of space between things. From a distance, it's hard to tell if someone's wearing a vampire costume or just a chic black outfit.</li><li>The noun distance usually refers to physical space in between two objects, like the distance between your parking spot and the entrance to the mall. It can also mean an interval in time, like a distance of two years since you graduated. Another meaning of distance is remoteness, like the distance between you and a close friend who doesn't talk to you much these days. The Latin root is distantia, ""a standing apart.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1785,"<ul><li>When you're an expert at something, you show expertise — or an exceptional knowledge of the subject. ""He had expertise in accounting, having excelled in math, but he had even more expertise in dancing, his hobby since a small child.""</li><li>Expertise has obvious roots in the word expert. Just about any interest or field has a place for experts. Just as one individual has expertise in world religions, another may have expertise in computer gaming. Working hard or immersing yourself in a specialty leads to expertise, and it comes through both study and hands-on experience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1786,"<ul><li>Think of something hard breaking in a crisp, snapping manner, and you've just imagined a fracture. The word is most often applied to a broken bone, but it can used to describe any sharp, sudden break of something solid.</li><li>The Latin frāctus means ""broken,"" and its descendant fracture can mean any break, though it's most often associated with a hard — maybe even brittle — material, such as a bone, a rock, or the earth’s crust. When something softer is split we say it is torn. For example, when we say someone broke an arm, we are referring to the bone, not the muscle; we'd say the muscle is torn. When someone funny ""breaks us up,"" we might say ""you fracture me!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1787,"<ul><li>A headache is a pain or ache in your head, especially one that lasts longer than a few minutes. You might get a headache after a day of staring at a computer screen.</li><li>There are many reasons for getting a headache, from staying up too late to a stressful day to skipping your morning cup of coffee. A more serious type of headache, like a migraine, might keep you home from work for a day, but most headaches are just a nuisance. You can also describe a problem or struggle as a figurative headache: ""Learning Danish is turning out to be a real headache."" In Old English, the word was heafodece.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1788,"<ul><li>Apply the noun implement when you want to use a fancy word for ""tool."" A knife and fork are implements for handling food.</li><li>The noun implement is a very useful word for just about anything you want to describe as a tool or a thing that helps you do something. An implement can be as simple as chimpanzees using a stick to eat ants with or a bulldozer that moves huge amounts of earth in building. The word relates to something that ""fills up"" a house, as in all sorts of things that allow a house to work properly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1789,"<ul><li>When you have an insight, you have a feeling or emotion or thought that helps you to know something essential about a person or thing.</li><li>Insight isn't based on hard facts or evidence. And it doesn't have anything to do with using your senses such as sight or smell. When you gain insight, you are using your intuition, or sixth sense. Insight is formed from the prefix in- plus the English word sight, so this word literally means seeing inward.</li></ul>"

Then you're willing to give up two of your limbs for the season's biggest baseball games.</li><li>Arms, legs, wings, flippers — these are all examples of limbs. But we shouldn't leave out the trees. They've got plenty of large branches or limbs as well. In fact, when you expose yourself to potentially negative consequences in order to help someone else, it's called ""going out on a limb"" — like crawling out on a big tree branch. Not a flipper.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1791,"<ul><li>Might is physical strength or power. If you try with all your might to climb a difficult rock wall, it means that you try as hard as you can to get to the top.</li><li>The noun might means a person's power or strength, like the might it takes to get a stuck lid off a jar of salsa, or the impressive power of a group, like a country's military might. Might is also a verb used to express possibility, like when you might go for a walk if it doesn't rain.</li></ul>"

If you think it’s going to be a great day, even though the bills are due, you lost your wallet, and you forgot your lunch, then you're full of optimism.</li><li>Optimism is expecting that the best will happen. It comes from the Latin word optimus, which means ""best."" Even if you don’t think the very best thing will always happen, if you're generally given to optimism, you think things will get better instead of worse. The opposite of optimism is pessimism, which is the expectation that everything will go wrong, or is wrong.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1793,"<ul><li>When someone has become good at something, they are proficient. After all those hours playing video games, you must be very proficient at them.</li><li>Proficient comes from the Latin for making progress, so if someone is proficient, they have made so much progress that they've become good at something. Use proficient to talk about improvement through practice instead of natural ability; even a person with no inherent skill at language can become proficient in Latin. If you're proficient at tennis, you're good, but it doesn't imply the kind of mastery for which the expert is used.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1794,"<ul><li>A raft is a vessel or structure that's made to float on water. You might have an inflatable raft you use for floating around your backyard pool.</li><li>Rafts come in many forms, from soft and squishy to wooden and permanent, like the rafts built on lakes for swimmers to rest on and dive off. Other rafts are mobile — they're small, flat boats meant for transporting people or goods across a river, for example. If you raft, you travel by raft. Experts guess that raft comes from the Old Norse word raptr, ""log.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1795,"<ul><li>A ridge is a long, narrow, elevated strip of land or any raised strip or band. A ridge is a line that rises above what it is attached to.</li><li>Think of a ridge as a combination between rim and edge. From the Old English hrycg, meaning “back of the man or beast” or “the top or crest” of something (combined, the senses mean “backbone”), ridge is often used for the beam that joins the parts of a sloping roof. Ridge also refers to the line formed by hills or mountains, as in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is made up of mountains that lie underneath the Atlantic Ocean.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1796,"<ul><li>Your shoulders are at the very top of your arms, where they meet your neck. When you shrug your shoulders, you lift them to convey indifference or the fact that you don't know the answer.</li><li>Human shoulders are versatile ball-and-socket joints that are flexible but sturdy enough to allow for lifting heavy objects. Another kind of shoulder is the strip at the side of a road where you can pull your car over in an emergency. This word is also used as a verb, for literally or figuratively carrying heavy burdens: ""You shoulder so much responsibility at work — they should give you a raise!"" Give someone ""the cold shoulder,"" and you're deliberately being unfriendly to them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1797,
4000EEW_B03_U30_1798,"<ul><li>A spouse is your companion, your mate, your partner. In ye olden times, spouse was used as a verb meaning “to marry,” but nowadays, it functions as a noun referring to either husband or wife.</li><li>Your spouse is often called ""your better half."" What we call adultery used to be referred to as spouse-breach in the early 13th century. American pediatrician Benjamin Spock said, “The surest measure of a man's or a woman's maturity is the harmony, style, joy, and dignity he creates in his marriage, and the pleasure and inspiration he provides for his spouse.” So, avoid that spouse-breaching at all costs, and till death do you part.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1799,"<ul><li>To thrust is to push forward quickly and forcibly, like the way a pirate would plunge or thrust a sword into his enemy.</li><li>Thrust is often used when you're talking about knives or swords or jabbing someone with something. In fact, a thrust refers to a sharp blow or stab. Violence aside, thrust can be any kind of forceful push or driving force. Aggressive street vendors thrust their wares on you and young movie stars are thrust into the limelight at an early age — which may be disconcerting, but certainly is not as frightening a knife thrust in your direction.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B03_U30_1800,"<ul><li>The verb tolerate means ""to put up with or allow."" You can tolerate your sister's love of Broadway musicals but really, you prefer dramas.</li><li>Think of tolerate as the open-minded verb. It means you allow something to happen or exist, even if you don't really like it. For example, you don't like your neighbor's loud music but you tolerate because he only blasts it on Saturday afternoons. Scientifically speaking, when your body can tolerate a drug, poison or even pollution, it means you aren't harmed by it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1801,"<ul><li>If you're responsible for your own actions, you are accountable for them. You are accountable for your behavior in school. So even if your friend throws pudding at you at lunch, you don't have the right to fling mystery meat back.</li><li>Accountable comes from the word ""account,"" which is itself from the Old French word acont, meaning to count (as in money). While you can be accountable for monetary damages, you're most likely to be held accountable for your actions and behavior, and the actions of your children and pets. If your dog bites another dog, you may be accountable for any vet bills incurred by the other dog's owner.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U01_1803,"<ul><li>An agenda is a list of things to do. If you're going to attend a meeting with a long agenda, you'll want to take your coffee mug along.</li><li>The word agenda is the plural for of the Latin word agendum, which literally means ""something to be done."" The noun retains this meaning  because an agenda is a plan — organized by time — of events or things to do. You might have a meeting, a lunch date, and a doctor's appointment on your agenda for the day. And when you run for office, you better have a political agenda — or a plan for what you want to get done if elected.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1804,"<ul><li>If you coin a phrase, that means you come up with a new way to say something, like the person who coined ""webizens"" to describe people who constantly use the Internet.</li><li>The verb coin literally refers to making coins, the change you probably have in your pocket. The word can be used in a broader sense — creating something new, usually something related to language. For example, you could coin a phrase or a new word for “joke.” The language authorities would be proud — unlike federal authorities if you tried to coin money. That kind of coining is a criminal offense.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1805,"<ul><li>If you notice that crumbs appear on your little brother's shirt whenever the cookies disappear from the cookie jar, you can say that you've correlated two facts, meaning that you've established or revealed that they're linked in a way that explains both of them.</li><li>Detectives correlate pieces of evidence in order to solve crimes. For example, they might correlate a suspect’s bandaged hand with a shattered third-floor window.  Correlate can also be used as a noun. Some companies promote products by suggesting that their products increase “happiness correlates,” or factors that have been shown to have a relationship with happiness, like health and friendship.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1806,"<ul><li>The act of pressing down on something is called making a depression, and when people suffer from psychological depression that is often what it feels like — the world itself is pressing down on them.</li><li>Depression can be a persistent mood (rotten), an economic situation (the worst), or just the geography (low). The Great Depression was when poor policy and economic circumstances combined to create a long period of time everyone struggled to even get food on the table.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1807,"<ul><li>While digital refers to something that can be manipulated by the fingers (called ""digits""), it also is a type of electronic signal that uses a binary code (a system using numbers, or ""digits"") to transmit information.</li><li>The Latin digitus means ""finger or toe,"" so it makes sense that by adding the suffix -al, which means ""being like,"" we get the adjective digital, ""fingerlike.""  The idea of the word referring to numerals began around 1938, soon becoming vital in computers. It's easy to imagine the connection between fingers and numbers, as the first mathematical ""calculators"" were probably fingers and toes.  Digital recording appeared in 1960 to challenge analog, soon becoming the broadcasting standard for clearer signals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1808,"<ul><li>Importance is the state of being greatly significant. If you're invited to your cousin's wedding and your friend's circus-themed birthday party on the same day, you'll have to decide which event has more importance to you.</li><li>Something or someone that is particularly notable can also be referred to with the noun importance. The historic and symbolic importance of the ""Declaration of Independence"" means that most kids learn about it in history class. In your history class, you'll also learn about the people who had positions of importance in drafting the ""Declaration,"" like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1809,"<ul><li>What do pianos and computers have in common? They both have keyboards! A computer keyboard has numbers and letters, but a piano keyboard has musical notes. The keyboard is the part that you press with your fingers.</li><li>Besides the rockin’ keyboard of a synthesizer, piano, or organ, there is also the computer keyboard. This keyboard is used for typing, with the earliest examples being the keyboards on typewriters. Occasionally, the word keyboard is used as a verb, meaning ""to type on keyboard."" It’s also, literally, a board with little hooks to hang the other kind of keys on. The musical instrument meaning came first, around 1819.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1810,"<ul><li>Loneliness is the state of being alone and feeling sad about it. Your loneliness might lead you to sit at home listening to depressing songs, or it could inspire you to go out and meet people.</li><li>You can be alone — and enjoy every minute of it. But from time to time, most of us experience loneliness. It's a feeling of sadness or even anxiety that occurs when you want company. On the other hand, it is possible to feel loneliness in a crowd, especially if you aren't interacting with others, like in a crowded subway car or busy grocery store.  Even a place can have a sense of loneliness, like an empty room just after all your guests have left.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1811,"<ul><li>All the various communications you use to get your news — magazines, websites, radio, and TV, among others — are collectively known as media. Many public figures thrive on media attention.</li><li>This word is frequently used as a mass noun: ""I wish the media would focus more on local news than on celebrity gossip!"" You can use it for the system of news organizations that put important stories in front of the public, as well as for the journalists themselves. Philosopher and theorist Marshall McLuhan is credited with the first use of this word to mean ""communication channels,"" in 1954.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1812,"<ul><li>A platform is any raised surface you can stand on, like the platform beside subway tracks where you wait for the train to arrive.</li><li>When you're standing on something that's higher than the surrounding area, you can call it a platform, like a train platform or a viewing platform at a historic site. A platform is also the official stance of a politician or a political group, like a platform of improving public education. Also, there is the footwear known as a platform shoe, which has a very thick sole which makes the wearer appear taller, like standing on a platform.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1813,"<ul><li>Poor describes having little of something. If you lack needed food and shelter, you're poor, and if you fall below a standard or don't even try, you're giving a poor performance. Empty pockets and empty efforts both mean poor.</li><li>Rich or wealthy often serve as opposites of poor. If you have material things, you're rich, and if you don't, you're poor. You can be full of knowledge but get poor grades if you're not studying, or you might be poor in terms of money but rich in friends and kindness. Poor can also be used as a noun, as in ""Charity is aimed at helping the poor.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1814,"<ul><li>Presence is the state of being somewhere.  When you get an invitation that reads ""Your presence is requested,” you are being asked to show up. Your style of being there — your demeanor or bearing — is also your presence.</li><li>Usually, presence is a physical thing.  Since the 1600s, the word has also meant something otherwordly, a spiritual or divine presence.  If you suddenly feel a weird presence in the room, perhaps it's a ghost . . . or just the cat.  Use the phrase ""presence of mind"" to indicate when someone is quick-witted or just paying attention.  While your job washing skyscraper windows doesn't require a lot of brain work, it's a good idea to keep your presence of mind while working.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1815,"<ul><li>Subject can mean ""topic,"" as in ""Let's change the subject."" It can also mean ""to make someone do something,"" as in ""Don't let your dad subject you to an hour-long lecture on fishing."" It can also mean everyone in a country who is not the ruler, as in ""The king greeted his subjects when he returned from abroad.""</li><li>A subject could be a broad branch of knowledge, like Biology, or a very narrow focus, like the effects of drought on avocados. If you are painting a portrait, the person posing for you is your subject. Subject can also mean beholden, or subordinate. If you are traveling in England, but not an English subject, or citizen, then you are still subject to English law.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1816,"<ul><li>A surge is a sudden strong swelling, like a tsunami wave that engulfs the land. Although a surge offers a fluid image, anything can experience a sudden surge, including emotions, political support, or an angry mob.</li><li>The original Latin word surgere, meaning “to spring up or rise,” serves as the basis for the word surge, which refers to a great sudden growth or swelling.  If you are watching a sad movie and you experience a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a tissue, pretend something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with reckless abandon?  Yeah, me too.  Christmas shopping can be dangerous when there is a surge of interest in one toy and desperate shoppers surge into stores trying to grab it up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1817,"<ul><li>The verb survey means to look something over. When you buy your first home, it's a pleasure to stand on the porch and survey your property.</li><li>Survey has several meanings, all of which come from Medieval Latin and Anglo words for looking over. As a noun, survey can mean a detailed study of something, but it also means a short summary with a broad view. A survey course gives an overview of a particular subject area, but doesn't make you an expert. Survey is also a verb. If you survey an area hit by an earthquake, you look closely at it to measure the damage.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1818,"<ul><li>A target is something to shoot at, either real or figurative. If you're an archer, you're aiming for the bull's-eye on the target. If you're selling cars for a living, then you likely have a sales target you need to hit.</li><li>You can hit a target, which is usually a good thing, or, less happily, you can be a target, such as a target of ridicule when you wear that goofy Swiss cheese hat and you aren't even from Wisconsin. As a marketing ploy, you could target Green Bay Packer season ticket holders when you decide to unload that hat. You might find a buyer among them, someone who wouldn't worry about being a target for those who object to silly hats.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1819,"<ul><li>A trend is what's hip or popular at a certain point in time. While a trend usually refers to a certain style in fashion or entertainment, there could be a trend toward warmer temperatures (if people are following trends associated with global warming).</li><li>A trend simply reflects what seems to be going around at any given time. A trend can be in any area and doesn't only reflect fashion, pop culture and entertainment. There can also be a trend in the stock market to be bullish or bearish, depending on economic indicators, or  a political trend reflecting a nation’s current mood. Some trends are fun, some fabulous, some appalling, but however long they last, you can be sure there will always be a new trend coming along to replace the old.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U01_1820,"<ul><li>To validate is to prove that something is based on truth or fact, or is acceptable. It can also mean to make something, like a contract, legal.</li><li>You may need someone to validate your feelings, which means that you want to hear, “No, you’re not crazy. It’s acceptable to be angry about that.” Or you may need someone to validate your parking ticket — which means you have to prove that you bought something, so you can get parking for free. Whatever it is you are seeking to validate needs the added support or action from someone else to make it valid.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1821,"<ul><li>Carbon is an element that takes the solid form of either graphite or diamond. Carbon is one of the basic elements of any living thing.</li><li>Carbon is known as the most essential element for life, and it's the second most abundant — after oxygen — in the human body. Carbon paper was an early method of making copies, using a sheet of paper coated with wax and, originally, carbon soot. The copy that results from writing or typing on paper that's placed on top, with a blank page beneath the carbon paper, is called a carbon copy. The Latin root of carbon is carbonem, ""charcoal.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1822,
4000EEW_B04_U02_1823,"<ul><li>Dust is the fine, powdery substance that settles on surfaces over time or is blown around outdoors. A junk shop might be full of beautiful old furniture and books, all covered with dust.</li><li>There's the dust you clean with a feather duster, and then there's the verb ""to dust."" You can dust your bookshelves, cleaning the dust from them, but you can also dust the surface of a cake with powdered sugar, covering it lightly. Informally, when something ""gathers dust,"" it goes unused, and when ""the dust settles,"" a situation calms down.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1824,"<ul><li>To emit means to give off or let out, and it usually has a lot to do with gases, smells and noises. All of which could be potentially embarrassing, depending on where they're coming from.</li><li>Lots of things can be emitted: body heat from your hands, high-pitched sound waves from a dog whistle, nasty odors from your mouth after a garlic-heavy lunch. Coming from the Latin emitter, it simply means to “send forth.” Since climate change is such a hot topic, you've probably heard people talking about how much CO₂ cars emit or how many greenhouse gases factories emit into the air.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1825,"<ul><li>When you make something possible, you enable it. Your good grades might enable you to get into your first-choice college. And a great teacher enabled you to get such good grades.</li><li>Enable has taken on the meaning of allowing or even helping someone continue to do something they really shouldn't. If your mother writes note after note to get you out of school for no good reason, she is enabling your habit of playing hooky. While you might think she's being cool, a therapist might call her an enabler and give her part of the blame.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1826,"<ul><li>If you like to grind your own coffee beans, it means you prefer to buy whole beans, put them in an electric grinder, and pulverize them into tiny bits before you brew your coffee.</li><li>When you grind something, you mill or crush it into smaller pieces, the way you grind pepper or grind a grain into flour. Two things that rub up against each other also grind together, which is what your teeth do if you grind them in your sleep. Informally, grind also means boring, tedious work, often in the sense of ""grind away"" or ""the daily grind."" This sense of grind was invented in the 1800s as college slang.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1827,"<ul><li>To heal is to recover or become healthy again. You'll need to wait until your blisters heal before you put your hiking boots back on and climb Mt. Everest.</li><li>They say time can heal, or cure, a broken heart, while you can be sure that rest, an ice pack, and propping your foot up will heal your twisted ankle. The Proto-Germanic word khailaz, which means ""to make whole"" is the root of both heal and the closely related word health. Don't confuse heal with heel, which is the back part of your foot or the command that makes a dog stop.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1828,"<ul><li>To integrate is to make parts of something into a whole. It also means to become one unit, or to make a place (like a school) open to people of all races and ethnic groups.</li><li>One of the results of the Civil Rights Movement was the decision to integrate the schools of the American South. Before this point, African-American students went to different schools than white students. After the decision to integrate the schools, students of all races went to the same schools. Integrate also means to make into a whole or to incorporate into a larger structure: ""If your school is missing a unit on thermodynamics, your science teacher could integrate it into the curriculum.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U02_1830,"<ul><li>Use the adverb moreover to add information that supports what’s already been said. You have to go shopping on Saturday to buy new tube socks, and moreover, you need to get a birthday present for your mom.</li><li>Breaking moreover into more and over helps you remember what it means: more information over what has already been said. When you hear someone use moreover that tips you off that whatever follows is going to relate to what came before. You can think of moreover as a formal way of saying besides. You may be sick of your brother always getting out of doing the chores, and, moreover, the guy has a really bad attitude about taking on responsibility.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1831,"<ul><li>When your younger brother runs around the house with scissors, you should definitely object. Perhaps a less sharp object such as a roll of paper towels would suffice.</li><li>An object (OB-ject) is something that is a visible entity, something that can be perceived by the senses. If you are unsure whether something is an object, test it by seeing whether it can cast a shadow; if it can, it's an object, if it can't, it's not. In court, lawyers will often say, ""I object!"" Here, the verb object (ob-JECT) means to express disagreement.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1832,"<ul><li>Any substance that makes the environment dirty or contaminated is a pollutant. Soot is an example of an air pollutant, and chemical pollutants can make their way into the water supply.</li><li>Trash that doesn't quickly biodegrade is one kind of pollutant—think of plastic bags floating around in the ocean. Chemicals that find their way into the air we breathe and the water we drink are another kind of pollutant. Pollutant comes from pollution, from the Late Latin pollutionem, ""defilement,"" and its root polluere, ""to soil or defile.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1833,"<ul><li>Powder is a loose substance made up of extremely tiny, dry, solid grains. Think of the baking powder and cocoa powder you use when you make your famous chocolate layer cake.</li><li>Powder is usually made by grinding a hard material until it's the consistency of flour, fine sand, or light snow — in fact, freshly fallen, fluffy snow is often called powder. There's a fine line between a grain and a powder, but generally powders have the characteristic of clumping together, while grains are more loose and separate. When you powder something, you apply powder to it. The Latin root, pulverem, means ""dust.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1834,"<ul><li>If you're prompt, you're on time. Go ahead and be prompt to class. Also, to prompt is to inspire or make happen. Getting in trouble for being late should prompt you to get a better alarm clock.</li><li>The adjective prompt can mean ""as scheduled,"" or simply ""quick."" When you prompt someone, you motivate them in some way: you might offer a reminder, assistance, or even inspiration to do something. For example, honking your car horn prompts your friend to get moving, and speaking up in defense of your classmate might prompt a bully to change his ways. If a director prompts an actor who's forgotten his lines, she reminds him what comes next.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1835,"<ul><li>When you reject something, you rule it out or dismiss it. If you're trying to pick a fancy restaurant to go to for your birthday, you'll probably reject the diner you went to just yesterday.</li><li>The verb reject has several shades of meaning. Reject can mean to refuse to accept or agree with something. If you don't believe space aliens are living on earth, you reject the idea — you just don't believe it. Reject can also mean to treat someone with contempt: ""My former best friend rejected me to hang out with a different crowd — but I found new friends with whom I had more in common.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1836,"<ul><li>A skeptic is a person who doesn't believe something is true unless they see evidence. As a skeptic, you refuse to believe your sister saw a ghost — after all, she can't prove it.</li><li>Skeptics are doubters — they need to see proof before they will believe. If you're a skeptic, you're probably dubious about things like astrology and magic. Some skeptics feel the same way about religion, preferring facts that can be scientifically and historically proven. Coming from the Greek word skeptikos, which means ""thoughtful or inquiring,"" it's no surprise that a skeptic is someone who asks a lot of questions — and isn't easily convinced.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1837,"<ul><li>Any material that possesses physical properties is called a substance. The word also refers to the gist or main idea of something. If you remember the main point of a lesson, you've got the substance.</li><li>The meaning of the noun substance has evolved over time, yet it has always been related to something sound and solid — from the Latin root substare, which means ""to stand firm,"" to the Middle English definition as an ""essential nature."" Nowadays, we use the word to define someone who possesses honesty and intelligence, or when we examine a message to find its essence. To be thought of as a ""person of substance"" is a good thing, but to be thought of as a ""substance abuser"" is not so good.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1838,"<ul><li>Substantially means ""to a great extent."" Your college fund was substantially increased by your grandfather's generous gift.  What the heck, I'll throw in a quarter, too.</li><li>Substantially is a good word to know any time you want to establish something's extent. It basically suggests ""a large part."" Your raise made your life substantially easier.  The word also suggests an essential nature, as in ""Nothing was substantially changed by the new law."" The word carries a great deal of weight, as can be seen in this quote by Albert Einstein: ""We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1839,"<ul><li>The ton is a unit of measurement. In North America, a ton is 2,000 pounds. Elephants weigh several tons — and blue whales can weigh up to 200 tons!</li><li>Although a ton is a specific way to measure weight, the word is often used more generally to mean ""a whole bunch"" or ""a lot."" So if your friend promises that her dad made a ton of cupcakes, don't be disappointed when you get to her house and discover only a few dozen. The original ton, spelled tun, was ""enough to fill a tun (or cask) of wine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U02_1840,"<ul><li>Transport means to move something, often large quantities of commercial products, over great distances. Container ships transport goods made in China to the U.S., where they will be sold.</li><li>A pipeline can transport oil. A school bus transports children. Soldiers get their postings but then must wait for news of their transport. If you are in a hurry to get something to market, you might consider using air transport, though that's expensive. Transport is from Latin words meaning ""carry across.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1841,"<ul><li>To align means to bring something into a straight line, or an easy agreement. If you always park on an angle and people are leaving mean notes on your windshield, learn to align the car with the parking space.</li><li>Align comes from the French a, meaning ""to"" and ligne meaning ""line,"" and it means to bring something into line with something else. This can be literal. If you are hanging a painting, you'll want to align it with the window frame. The line can also be metaphorical. If you run for office, your political opinions will need to be aligned with those of your supporters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1842,"<ul><li>If you have the authority to do something, you have the right or power to do it. You are the big cheese. Or, if you know more about a topic than most, you are an authority on that topic.</li><li>Giving someone authority grants them the power to make important decisions or have accepted opinions. When you leave your kids with a babysitter, you give her the authority to put them to bed at 7 p.m., no matter how much they insist you let them stay up until midnight. You'll feel more confident leaving the babysitter in charge of bedtime decisions if she's written two books on the subject and is an authority, or renowned expert, on children's sleep habits. Being an authority on children's sleep habits helps your babysitter enforce that 7 p.m. bedtime, but it may not convince the kids.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1843,"<ul><li>A barn is an outbuilding on a farm used to keep animals or crops safe and dry. A farmer might store hay in the upper part of a barn, and have stalls for horses in the main section.</li><li>In rural areas there are many barns, often built from wood and standing near a main farmhouse. Some barns have wide doors with stalls for animals inside, and a hayloft at the top, where hay or other crops can be stored. In Old English, a barn or bereærn literally meant ""barley house,"" from bere, ""barley,"" and aern, ""house.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1844,"<ul><li>When you betray someone or something, you provide information whether you mean to do it or not, like the loud growling of your stomach that betrays your hunger or the secret you tell about your friend that betrays her trust.</li><li>When you betray someone or something, you reveal something, like a secret or your true feelings. You may betray your impatience, for example, if you sit at your desk tapping your fingers. There is another meaning of betray that is just the opposite: lie. You betray your friend if you pretend that something is true just to trick him into doing what you want. In this case, betray means the same thing as deceive.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U03_1846,"<ul><li>When capitalized, Catholic refers to the Catholic Church. With a lower-case ""c,"" catholic means ""universal"" and ""inclusive."" If you listen to anything from hip-hop to Baroque, you have catholic taste in music.</li><li>When it entered the English language in the sixteenth century, catholic simply meant ""general"" or ""common."" Applied to the Western Church, it essentially meant ""the Church universal,"" or the whole body of Christian believers, as opposed to separate congregations. After the Reformation, the Western Church called itself the Catholic Church to distinguish itself from communities of faith that were no longer obedient to Rome. This usage remains the most common, although you can still use catholic to mean general.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1847,"<ul><li>When you cooperate, you work together. You can cooperate with the police by telling them everything you know about your neighbor’s pet leopard, or your preschooler can cooperate with you by doing everything you tell him to do, now!</li><li>The verb cooperate is originally from the combination of The Latin prefix co-, meaning “together,” and operari, meaning “to work.” The term “co-op” is a shortening of cooperative and is used when people work together (or cooperate) to run a preschool, health food store, or a residence. When you start or join a co-op, be prepared to cooperate with your partners, and remember: somebody has to clean the bathrooms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1848,"<ul><li>When you detain someone, you hold them back, slow them down, or stop them from moving on. If you are detained by the police, you may be late for the big football game, even if you were speeding to get there by the kickoff.</li><li>There are lots of words that contain the root tain, like contain and retain. These come from Latin tenere, which means ""to hold."" Detain is specifically used when you're talking about holding someone so they can't go anywhere. It's often used in discussions involving the police who detain people who they think might be guilty. But you can use detain, say, when you're explaining why you were late: ""I was detained at the office by a conference call that wouldn't end. Sorry.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1849,"<ul><li>To exit is to go out of or leave a place. When an actor exits, he moves off the stage and out of sight of the audience.</li><li>You can literally exit a room or a building, or exit in a more figurative way: ""She decided to exit politics after two terms as Senator."" The door or passage through which you exit can also be called an exit, like the emergency exit on a train or airplane. The stage direction, as in ""exit, stage left,"" is the original English use of the word, from the Latin exitus, ""a leaving, a going out.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1850,"<ul><li>Generally, exceptional is a compliment––""the concert was exceptional"" means it was better than what could have been expected. But it can also just mean unusual. ""Maria gets to skip gym, but hers is an exceptional case.""</li><li>Exceptional begins with the Latin prefix ex- 'out,' because something exceptional stands out in some way. In certain cases, exceptional can mean under-performing. Children with special educational needs are sometimes referred to in this way, as exceptional or special.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1851,"<ul><li>If you bolt, scram, skedaddle, or get the heck of out Dodge, you flee. You run away fast. Don’t confuse flee with ""flea."" They sound alike, but the second kind is an insect whose bites make you itch.</li><li>We get the word flee from Old English fleon. When you flee, you get away as quickly as you can. You might even take flight to escape — usually from a dangerous place or situation. In a moment of panic after stealing a cookie from the cookie jar, you might decide to flee the scene of the crime.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1852,"<ul><li>A network is any interconnected system. The Internet is a network of computers all talking to one another. A subway is a network of interconnected train lines running underneath the city.</li><li>A wise man once said that if the atom was the symbol of the 20th century, the network should be the symbol of the 21st. Increasingly our world relies on networks, the vast interconnected systems of people, electronics, ideas and even resources. To put pressure on any one part of a network is to put pressure on all parts, because, by definition, a network is interconnected. Whether the network is a television network, a cellular network, or a social network — each is a vast system of interconnected parts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1853,"<ul><li>If you consider how people are treated in airports an outrage, you get really angry over airport security or the price of airport food. Six dollars for a piece of pizza? What an outrage!</li><li>Something is an outrage when it is shocking and makes you angry. Stealing from an orphanage? That's an outrage. Sometimes outrage leads to action. Public outrage over the latest political  scandal often makes the news.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1854,"<ul><li>A parish is a local church community that has one main church and one pastor. Parish members do more than just attend church. They organize community activities, social events, and — very important — coffee and donuts on Sunday mornings.</li><li>A parish is technically a piece of land. It’s a section of a diocese that has the right number of churchgoers to have its own church. But when you refer to a parish, you’re usually talking about more than the space itself. You're describing the people who attend the church, as well as the church property. So if someone says, ""Our parish is thriving,"" it means there's a full congregation and enough funds to maintain the church in good condition.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1855,"<ul><li>Passage describes the act of passing or traveling from one place to the next.</li><li>People often use the word passage to specifically refer to a journey by ship, as in, ""The passage to America was long and hard."" A section of written work or music can also be called a passage.  You can think of a passage of music as moving the listener from one part of the piece to the next. And, finally, you can call a path a passage or passageway, especially when it's narrow. A street is not a passage, but the little tunnel behind the secret door in your closet is certainly a passage.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1856,"<ul><li>A pastor is someone with the authority to lead religious services. Pastors lead church services and help others worship.</li><li>Pastor is a religious title used mostly in Christian churches. The pastor is a leader within a church who has been ordained and therefore given the authority to conduct religious services. The pastor leads Sunday mass and other types of rituals, such as funerals. Members of the congregation may seek a pastor for advice. Within a religious community, a pastor is someone respected very much.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1857,"<ul><li>When a person or a group monitors a specific area, that's a patrol. A police officer's night patrol might involve walking a beat on certain city streets.</li><li>A patrol is the activity of watching a neighborhood or region, and also refers to the person or group doing the watching. And when you join such a group, you can say you patrol. Your neighborhood watch group might patrol the town in groups of three, driving up and down the streets keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. The French patrouille, ""a night watch,"" comes from patrouiller, ""go the rounds,"" and originally ""tramp trough the mud.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1858,"<ul><li>A raid is a military attack, especially a quick surprise attack. The word comes from the military but has spread out — police might raid a shady nightclub to find bad guys, or a babysitter might raid the refrigerator.</li><li>When an army launches a raid, you can say they raid, or attack abruptly. This verb can also be used to mean ""search"" or ""enter unexpectedly,"" as when police officers raid a suspect's home or summer campers' raid a neighboring cabin. The military meaning is the oldest, and the word comes from the Scottish rade, ""a riding"" or ""a journey,"" from the Old English rad, which is also the root of road.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1859,"<ul><li>The verb rail means to criticize severely. When you rail against increased taxes at a town meeting, you speak openly and loudly about how wrong the increase is and point out the problems it will cause.</li><li>Rail can also mean ""to complain.""  When your mom asks you to vacuum the house, you might rail against this chore by saying that you ALWAYS do the vacuuming, that vacuuming is SO hard, and that you hate the stupid vacuum! Rail can also mean to spread negative information about someone in an abusive way. If your ""friends"" rail against you to everyone in school, they're spreading nasty rumors about you, and you should find new friends!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U03_1860,"<ul><li>A tunnel is a passage that runs underground or through something, like a train tunnel that cuts through a mountain. Some theme parks have networks of underground tunnels so that employees can move around out of sight of visitors.</li><li>Some tunnels, like New York's Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel, which connect New York City to New  Jersey, are large and solid enough to drive cars through. Others are much smaller, like the tunnels small animals dig through snow or soil for safety and shelter. As a verb, tunnel means ""dig a tunnel"" or ""force through,"" the way your neighborhood groundhog tunnels under your dad's vegetable garden.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1861,"<ul><li>The adjective comfortable describes something that makes you feel relaxed, like a comfortable couch that makes you want to curl up on it and take a nap.</li><li>In addition to describing things that feel good, like shoes that don't hurt your feet, comfortable can mean ""feeling free from stress or worry."" If you are comfortable around people, you can be yourself. It can also mean ""secure"" — a family that, though not rich, lives a comfortable lifestyle, meaning they have considerable savings, or you feeling comfortable speaking Spanish in Chile, meaning you trust your ability to communicate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1862,"<ul><li>Whenever you learn something new, you are getting some amount of education. You might get your education in school, where you're learning to speak French, or in your garage, where you're learning how to repair your bike.</li><li>Back in the 1500s, the word education meant ""the raising of children,"" but it also meant ""the training of animals."" While there are probably a few teachers who feel like animal trainers, education these days has come to mean either ""teaching"" or ""the process of acquiring knowledge.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1863,"<ul><li>When you help someone by offering positive words of support and approval, that's encouragement. It must have been the words of encouragement you gave in the airport lounge that helped your friend board the plane.</li><li>Within the word encouragement we see the word ""courage,"" which means the ability to face danger and deal with it.  To encourage, then, is to help develop that ability in someone, while the ""ment"" at the end makes that development into a noun, the act of giving courage or support to another.  You needed a little encouragement to try horse riding again, after your injuries healed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1864,"<ul><li>To endorse is to give support to someone or something. ""I endorse this!"" means ""I think this is a good thing, and so should you.""</li><li>People endorse in many ways. When someone endorses a politician, it means ""You should vote for this person, and I'm putting my reputation on the line to say so."" When someone endorses a product in a commercial, it means ""Go buy this! You'll like it."" To endorse is to give support. You can also endorse a check, which means writing your name or someone else's on the back so that you or the other person can cash or deposit it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1865,"<ul><li>Things that are the same size or have the same traits are said to be equal. When it comes to people, being equal means everyone has the same rights and opportunities — and responsibilities.</li><li>When two or more things are level or balanced, they are said to be equal. This balance can refer to volume, weight, or quantity, or any other trait being compared. In a contest in which each side has the same chance of winning, the match is said to be equal. And when a person is considered at the same level with another in some respect, he or she is said to be that person's equal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1866,"<ul><li>If you have a mirror above your bed, the first thing you see each morning might be your own face. Once you've seen that your nose is still there, you're ready to face the day!</li><li>When you face someone you are across from them, maybe looking them in the eye. If you make a funny face, the person across from you might laugh. Or, if the person is your mother, she might tell you to stop it unless you want your face to stay that way. If you want to “save face,” then it's important to you not to look foolish in front of others.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1867,"<ul><li>This word has many meanings — such as a field of daffodils, a field of study, or a field of battle in a war. Think of a field as an area, either physically or subject-wise.</li><li>A type of business or area of study is a field. All the subjects you study in school are different fields of study. Baseball players field a ball, and you need nine players to field a team. All the horses in a race are the field. Your field of vision is what you can see. Researchers go into the field to collect data — for an education researcher, that’s a school. Most fields are specific areas of one sort or another.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1868,"<ul><li>To foster is to nurture something. A teacher could foster creativity by providing crayons to every student. You can also foster a child, which means the child lives in your home for a time.</li><li>You may have seen photos of a cat taking care of a baby rabbit, or a pig nursing a litter of puppies: those are little foster families. Foster can be a verb (to foster someone or something) or an adjective used to describe a foster family, child, or parent. The word is from the Old English fostrian meaning ""to supply with food, nourish, support,"" which sounds like what those mama hogs were doing. Unlike adopt, foster has a time limit.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1869,"<ul><li>Guidance can mean steering (like the navigation system in a satellite) or the act of providing direction (like a guidance counselor does).</li><li>Back in the 1530s, guidance started out meaning ""the process of directing conduct,"" similar to what we think of when we think of parents, mentors, or counselors. If you've ever asked a friend for advice on what to wear, you were seeking their guidance. But guidance also applies to physical direction. We might use a global positioning system (GPS) for guidance when we drive. Years ago, sailors relied on the stars for guidance. Sherpas provide guidance to climbers hiking Mt. Everest so they don't get lost.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1870,"<ul><li>If you grasp something in your hands, you hold it. Be careful when you hold the puppy — he's so wriggly, and you wouldn't want to drop him!</li><li>Hold also means to keep from exhaling. If you forget to hold your breath when you go underwater, you're sure to come up sputtering. The noun hold means the cargo area on a ship or airplane. When you check your bag, it's stored in the hold of the plane during the flight. If you packed your book and your snacks in it, it might make more sense to hold onto it instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1871,"<ul><li>Inclusion is the act of including someone in something, like a school, club, or team.</li><li>If you are familiar with the word include — meaning to make someone or something a part of something larger — then inclusion should make sense. You might be happy at your inclusion on the school's volleyball team. The inclusion of an actor in a movie is exciting. When there's a new President, people wait and see who will earn inclusion in the cabinet. In biology, an inclusion body is a very small body found within another on the cellular level.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1872,"<ul><li>The Olympics often inspire people to take up a sport, but they can also inspire patriotism. Inspire means to excite, encourage, or breathe life into.</li><li>Inspire comes from the Latin word that means to inflame or to blow in to. When you inspire something, it is as if you are blowing air over a low flame to make it grow. A film can be inspired by a true story. Studying for your test will inspire confidence in you. Successful people often have a role model who inspired them to greatness. Who inspires you?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1873,"<ul><li>Mere means pure and simple, nothing more and nothing less. If the mere mention of someone's name makes you happy, then just hearing his name — and that alone — is enough to make you smile.</li><li>Mere can have a little irony attached. If you introduce yourself as ""a mere student,"" when you’re announcing your astounding invention, you're contrasting your lowly status with the enormity of your invention. This kind of mere comes from the Latin for ""undiluted."" Mere has a homograph — a completely different word that's spelled the same — and this mere means a lake or a pond. It’s related to the Dutch word meer — there’s lots of water in Holland.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1874,"<ul><li>A position is the point where something is located, as on a map, or the posture it's arranged in, such as an ""upright position.""</li><li>Position has many meanings. As a noun it can be a job or post in an organization (an ""open position"" is a job opening); the role assigned to the individual player of a team sport (guard, forward, and center are basketball positions); a view or perspective on a particular issue; or the place an item occupies on a list or sequence (in racing, ""pole position"" is first, on the inside). As a verb it can mean lay, place, pose, or set.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1875,"<ul><li>Someone with power has physical strength or they're in control of things. So a weakling who's in charge of a business still has a lot of power.</li><li>Power comes from the Latin word potere, which means ""to be able."" But things with power are much more than able — they're able to exert a lot of force. ""The powers that be"" are those who hold authority, and ""the power behind the throne"" refers to the people who exert influence without being formally in charge. When used as a verb, power means ""to supply with mechanical or electrical energy,"" as in a nuclear-powered submarine.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1876,"<ul><li>A responsibility is something you're required to do as an upstanding member of a community.  If you're in a band, it's your responsibility to learn the songs and show up to practice on time.</li><li>Responsibility comes from the Latin responsus, which means “to respond.” There are actually a few different definitions of the noun.  It can be another word for trustworthiness, as in, ""He demonstrated his responsibility by showing up to practice on time.""  And it can be used to describe the social force that motivates us to take on individual responsibilities, as in, ""A sense of responsibility drove him to memorize all of the songs.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1877,"<ul><li>To soar means more than just to fly; it means to rise swiftly, to feel the wind slipping below you as you ride it higher, higher, higher. Flying is just moving through the air. Soaring, though, suggests exhilaration, even joy.</li><li>Think about the anticipation you feel when you buy a lottery ticket — your hopes soar as you contemplate the possibilities. It's the same wonderful feeling you get when someone you have a crush on notices you, when you land that perfect job, when you hold your child. The word soar comes from the Latin, ex-, which means ""out,"" and aura, meaning ""breeze, air,"" together meaning ""out of the air,"" which is precisely how it feels to soar.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1878,"<ul><li>A tool is an instrument that you use to help you accomplish some task. If you are going to build a bookcase, you'll need the proper tools, like a saw, a drill, and a tape measure.</li><li>A tool is also something that you use to perform the duties of a certain profession. The tools of a kindergarten teacher's trade include construction paper, glue sticks, and safety scissors. As a verb, tool can mean to drive aimlessly just for fun, the way you might tool around town in your convertible on a beautiful summer day.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1879,"<ul><li>Anything vocal is related to speaking or singing, like your math class's vocal objections to a pop quiz or the vocal warm-ups that a jazz singer does before a big performance.</li><li>The word vocal comes from the Latin vocalis (""sounding, sonorous, or speaking"") and its root meaning of ""voice."" As a noun, it refers to a section of music that's sung, rather than played on an instrument: ""The vocals in that song were beautiful, but the guitar was out of tune."" There's also a figurative way to be vocal, by expressing your ideas passionately and freely: ""She was vocal about her environmentalism.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U04_1880,
4000EEW_B04_U05_1881,"<ul><li>Something that is academic is related to school. Your parents might want to spend less time playing video games and more time focusing on academic pursuits. The noun academic refers to a professor or scholar.</li><li>As a noun or an adjective, academic relates to book learning and not always in a good way. An academic discussion back in Plato's Academy was probably something better than what it has more recently come to mean: a discussion that's academic has no place in the real world; it's not practical. An academic might have a PhD in Robotics but not know how to work the TV.  It doesn't have to mean stuffy, though, just related to college — like when you need an academic gown for graduation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1882,"<ul><li>Acceptance is taking something given to you. You might be relieved by your friend's acceptance of your apology for accidentally riding your bike over his foot.</li><li>An acceptance of someone or something is also an indication that you approve of or believe in it (or them). If you dye your hair green and wear a suit made of bear fur, gaining your grandmother’s acceptance may prove difficult if she's a conservative dresser and an animal lover. In legal terms acceptance is language signifying consent to the terms of an offer, leading to the creation of a contract.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1883,"<ul><li>An array is a display of something — usually something varied. You might encounter an array of cereal brands in the cereal aisle of the grocery store. Your head says to choose the Crunchy Oats 'n' Bran, but your heart wants the Sugar-Coated Chocopuffs.</li><li>Although the word array comes from the Old French areyer, ""to put in order,"" an array often just comes together. It can be an intentional design of people or features — everything from software packages to fashion shows can have an ""impressive array"" of components. Or, an array can fall together in nature or by chance: ""the clouds became an array of beautiful shapes after the storm.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1884,"<ul><li>To blur is to make or become unfocused and fuzzy. Crying hard can cause your vision to blur until you wipe your tears away.</li><li>Heavy smog or early morning fog can blur your view of the city, and two candidates' similar views can blur the differences between their political parties. In both cases, things become indistinct and hazy. You can also call the haze itself a blur: ""The whole day was just a blur after the exciting news I got in the morning."" In the 16th century, blur meant ""smear on the surface of writing.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U05_1886,"<ul><li>Canvas is a heavy, coarse fabric artists paint on. It's also used to make sails, shoes, tents, or comfy director's chairs. It's a full-service fabric!</li><li>The noun canvas comes from the Latin cannabis by way of the Greek kannabis, meaning “hemp,"" which it was originally made of. It usually refers to the canvas we paint on, but you could carry a canvas bag while wearing canvas Converse high-tops. Henry David Thoreau, the poet and philosopher, said, “The world is but a canvas to our imaginations.” Don't confuse it with canvass, with the extra ""s"" — that's when people try to chat to get your vote.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1887,"<ul><li>A cinema is another word for a movie theater. If you love films, you probably spend a lot of time at the cinema.</li><li>It's more common to say cinema in Britain than in the United States, but any English speaker will know what you're talking about if you ask, ""Want to go to the cinema?"" You can also use cinema to talk about the film industry and its history: ""This is my favorite film in all of American cinema."" The word was first used in 1899, from the French cinéma, which was a shortened form of cinématographe, ""motion picture projector and camera.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1888,"<ul><li>If you attend school, you probably have a favorite class — a series of lectures or discussions where you can learn about a particular subject, like English, math, or economics.</li><li>The characteristic of being high quality or displaying elegance is also called class. Your snobby friend might glance around your favorite diner and say, ""Let's go somewhere else. This place has no class."" In society, class refers to a ranking system based on socio-economics, birth, education level, or a combination of those things. Your ancestors might have been working class, until your grandfather struck it rich.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1889,"<ul><li>Her big eyes and plump lips are distinctive features that make her a great model. These are just some of the special features that distinguish her.</li><li>You might recognize the Latin prefix dis in the adjective distinctive. Dis often means ""apart"" or ""away."" Think of this when trying to remember the word distinctive. Someone with distinctive features has features that set them ""apart"" from others. Yes, its stepped-back architecture and distinctive spire are among the Empire State Building's distinctive features, but its most distinctive feature has to be its height: for decades there wasn't another building in New York that came close!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1890,"<ul><li>A key is a piece of metal that fits inside a lock and turns to open it. You might have a key ring with a house key, a car key, and maybe several more keys.</li><li>A key is typically cut from metal, although many hotels use plastic keys for their guest rooms. If you are told that your attendance is key, you know you have to go. Another meaning of key is a button or lever you press with your fingers, like a piano key or a typewriter key. A key is also an explanation, like the answer key for a test or the key to success. And when you sing in key, you have the correct pitch.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1891,"<ul><li>The noun movement means a change of position or location. If you're watching a play, you might notice that an actor's repeated movement from one side of the stage to the other shows her character's nervousness.</li><li>A campaign to create some change or achieve a goal is another kind of movement, like the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s. A major section of a musical piece is also called a movement. Each movement of a symphony can have a different tempo and feel, working to build the piece toward a dramatic finish. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony has four movements.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1892,"<ul><li>Practice can be a noun or a verb, but either way it's about how things are done on a regular basis.  You can practice shotput every day because your town has a practice of supporting track-and-field events.</li><li>One can practice the tuba for hours on end, repeating the same song over and over, serving to both get better at the tuba and to convince the neighbors they should move to Florida.  You could learn the common practice of offering a guest a beverage when they arrive at your party, if you care to be polite.  One can also practice a profession or a religion, as in “I practice Buddhism and I have a booming international law practice.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1893,"<ul><li>If your friend says she is going to fly on wings made of wax, you might tell her to ""be realistic!"" What you mean is, ""In the real world, that is not going to happen.""</li><li>While you might really want to go to an Ivy League college, it's probably more realistic to apply to state schools if your grades aren't that good. A movie can be called realistic if it seems to represent life as it is. Do you ever wonder if reality TV is more realistic than scripted television? The jury is still out on that, but most people agree that if you're being realistic, what matters most about a TV show are its ratings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1894,"<ul><li>Your reflection is what you see in the mirror. Other things that bounce back at you are also reflections — light waves, sound waves, even your thoughts.</li><li>Reflection comes from the Latin reflectere, made up of the prefix re-, ""back,"" and flectere, ""to bend."" So it's bending something back: your reflection in the mirror is the light waves that bounce your image back at you. When you pause for reflection — serious thinking, that is — your thoughts are bending inward. Reflection can also be a consequence of something: the way your dog mopes around when you're away is a reflection of how much he misses you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1895,"<ul><li>A rule is a regulation or direction for doing some particular activity. If you have a ""no shoes"" rule at your house, it means everyone has to take them off at the door.</li><li>Other than laws or conditions about what can't and can't be done, rules can be tried-and-true tips like a grammar rule about subject-verb agreement or a spelling rule about making a singular noun plural. Rule can also pertain to power — how someone handles it or how long it lasts, like the peaceful rule of a king whose rule lasted 50 years.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1896,"<ul><li>It's a stroke of luck, or chance event, to find a terrific parking space on a rainy day, but no one feels lucky when their grandfather has a stroke, a sudden debilitating loss of oxygen to the brain.</li><li>Stroke is a high value word — many meanings, yet rarely misunderstood in context.  You can swim a certain stroke (or just doggie paddle), you can stroke a cat's fur, you can figuratively stroke your boss's ego by flattering him, or you can have a stroke of brilliance and solve world hunger. Hopefully you won't suffer a stroke and need hospitalization. Its origin as a medical term goes back to the 1500s when it was shortened from ""the Stroke of God's Hand.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U05_1898,"<ul><li>Traditional can describe anything that follows tradition, or a usual way of doing things. Traditional Mexican food includes tortillas and beans. A bag of corn chips with chili and fake cheese sauce, on the other hand, is not traditional.</li><li>A tradition can be personal or national, and the adjective traditional has tons of uses. Traditional football might require a brown pigskin ball or a white soccer ball, depending on where you live. Your traditional national costume could be a sari, while your friend's is a kimono. And that walking taco? It's traditional carnival food for some.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U05_1899,
4000EEW_B04_U05_1900,"<ul><li>The noun width means the measurement of an object from one side to the other. The width of your twin bed is less than the width of your parents' queen-sized bed.</li><li>When you're talking about the dimensions of something, specifically how wide it is, you're discussing its width. The width of your backyard might not lend itself to a full croquet court, but you can still play horseshoes back there. And the width of the streets in some Midwestern cities might surprise you if you're used to narrow New England roads. Before the word width gained popularity in the 1620s, people used the now less common wideness instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1901,"<ul><li>Rousing, reverential, sometimes even revolutionary, an anthem is a song that represents the ideals of a group of people.</li><li>Anthem comes from Old English antefn. The original word meant a song sung antiphonally, or in turns by two groups of singers. Today, anthem has little to do with the way the vocals are arranged and more to do with the content of the message. When a group of people sing an anthem, whether it’s the national anthem, or the anthem of your third-grader’s beetle-collecting club, they express their devotion to a cause they identify with.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1902,"<ul><li>Beyond is an adverb that means “in addition” or “farther along."" If you’re headed to the silo beyond the barn, that means you’re going to the silo that’s on the far side of the barn.</li><li>Beyond is related to the word yonder, which you might have heard in expressions like, “Over yonder hill, you’ll see a picket fence.” Yonder kind of means “that one over there, in the distance.” Beyond is past yonder. If you’re going above and beyond, it means you’re doing more than was expected. If you’re beyond Kelly in your math homework, it means you’ve done more than she has. And if the show was beyond your expectations, it was better than you had hoped.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1903,"<ul><li>Determination can be a decision, or the focus you need to get something done.</li><li>The sense of determination, as making up your mind about something, finds its roots in an Old French word meaning “decision,"" such as the judge's determination that the man was guilty, or the panel's determination that the chocolate was too bitter. Usually the decision comes after much consideration and research, like when Copernicus made the determination that the earth revolves around the sun. The word has come to mean also grit, gumption, pluck, persistence: ""With hard work and determination, they were able finish the school project on time.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1904,
4000EEW_B04_U06_1905,"<ul><li>Whether it’s the bones making up a skeleton or the wooden sections on your breakfast table, the point where two things come together is called a joint.</li><li>The noun joint came into English through the French word joindre, meaning “to join.” Use joint to describe the point where two things connect, or join. A joint on your body allows for movement — you can look at your finger to see how that works. As an adjective, joint means ""combined,"" like a joint gift to someone that was purchased with money combined from two or more people.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U06_1907,"<ul><li>A mark is some kind of dot, line, or figure that emphasizes or distinguishes something. You might make a mark on your calendar to remind you of your best friend's birthday.</li><li>There are many kinds of marks, from punctuation — like quotation marks — to spots or scars on skin — ""The bee sting left a mark on his cheek."" When you mark something, you leave a mark on it, check it off, cross it out, or label it. You can also mark something by noticing or acknowledging it: ""Let's mark your birthday with a big party!"" Shopkeepers mark prices on goods, and a ""mark down"" is a reduction in price.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1908,"<ul><li>Use the verb mobilize to describe preparing something — or someone — to spring into action, or to be put into use. You might mobilize the troops, or even your classmates, into action.</li><li>A busy mother might mobilize her kids to grab their lunches and head out to the bus stop on time, and a detective might mobilize her resources before tracking down a wily criminal. Mobilize literally means ""make mobile,"" and the Latin root is mobilis, ""movable, pliable, or flexible.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1909,"<ul><li>A nation is a country and its people. It's also the word used for the Native American tribal federations in the US — the Cherokee Nation, for instance — which have their own governments and territories.</li><li>Nation comes from the Latin root nat-, which means ""born"" — the neonatal unit in a hospital is where the newborn babies are cared for. You can also use nation more loosely for ethnic or religious groups: you might speak of ""the Jewish nation,"" meaning not just the country, or nation, of Israel, but Jews all over the world. The Nation of Islam is an African-American Muslim group.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1910,
4000EEW_B04_U06_1911,"<ul><li>A sudden or abrupt onset of something really bad is an outbreak. You could experience an outbreak of measles or an outbreak of violence; either way, try to protect yourself.</li><li>When you talk about an outbreak of something, it's almost always something terrible, or at least unwanted. You might hear about an outbreak of war in a distant country, or an outbreak of violence in a big city, or an outbreak of disease among farm animals. Outbreak started as a Middle English verb around 1300, becoming a noun meaning ""eruption"" about three hundred years later.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1912,"<ul><li>To pray is to talk to a deity or god. Some people pray by asking for help or guidance.</li><li>Most religious believers pray in one way or another — some pray out loud, thanking God for the things they have. Others pray silently when they're afraid or worried, or in a group of worshipers at a church or temple. You can also pray in a non-religious way, by begging for something: ""I pray you'll really listen to my explanation."" Pray comes from the Old French preier, ""to pray,"" with its Latin root word, precari, ""ask earnestly, beg, or entreat.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1913,"<ul><li>A prisoner is a person being held in prison as a punishment. During wartime a prisoner is someone held captive by the enemy. Alternately, if you’re so attractive you can’t leave the house, you’re a prisoner of your own good looks.</li><li>Someone who's caught robbing a bank or stealing a car will probably become a prisoner, locked inside a prison for as long as the sentence specifies. If you feel stuck or confined in some way, you may consider yourself a metaphorical prisoner, like an actor who whines that he’s a prisoner of his own success, since he’s not able to go anywhere without cameras flashing and fans screaming.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1914,"<ul><li>A sacrifice is a loss or something you give up, usually for the sake of a better cause. Parents sacrifice time and sleep to take care of their children, while kids might sacrifice TV time to hang out with mom and dad.</li><li>Though no longer used only in a religious context, sacrifice comes from the Latin sacra and facere, meaning ""to perform sacred rites."" If you've studied ancient cultures like the Incas, you've probably heard of ""human sacrifice,"" where a person is killed in a sacred ceremony to please the gods. But thankfully those kinds of sacrifices don't happen anymore.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1915,"<ul><li>Silence is quietness, or a lack of sound. When you silence a noisy movie-goer, you shush her.</li><li>When there's silence, nothing is heard. Silence is empty, the opposite of a noisy racket. A library is one place where there's supposed to be silence so people can concentrate. To silence someone is to hush him up or tell him to be quiet. Silence also has a more disturbing meaning: if someone threatens you to keep you from saying something, she's trying to silence you. Censorship silences free speech.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1916,"<ul><li>Use the adverb thus in place of words like therefore or so when you want to sound proper.</li><li>Use thus interchangeably with words like consequently, ergo, hence, and just like that. For example, if you want to sound fancy you could say no one showed up for water aerobics, thus the class was cancelled. It had to be thus. Thus is also, rarely, a noun that means a good-smelling gum resin from trees that we don't really use anymore.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1917,"<ul><li>A tribute is a sign of respect or admiration, an award to honor a person's accomplishments. A famous director receives a lifetime achievement award as a tribute to his many successful films.</li><li>We're most familiar with the use of the word tribute meaning to honor someone with words or an award. You can hear a tribute if you're lucky enough to attend an entertainment awards ceremony, or need to attend a funeral. Students will give a retiring teacher flowers as a tribute to her years of service in education. Tribute can also mean a kind of payment that's given from one nation to another.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1918,"<ul><li>A victory is a win. In sports or war, one side usually achieves victory.</li><li>If you've ever won anything, you've achieved a victory: being successful in some kind of contest, sport, or battle. The winners of elections, football games, chess matches, debates, and scholarships all have won impressive victories. In war, there's victory too. People who overcome a disease such as cancer also consider that a victory. The opposite of victory is defeat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1919,"<ul><li>Something that's wild lives in nature and isn't tamed. Your pet poodle isn't wild, but the groundhog that lives under your garden shed is wild.</li><li>An animal or plant in its native habitat is wild, like a wild dingo or a wild strawberry. An untamed bit of nature, like your overgrown back yard, or a stormy ocean, is also wild. If a person is wild, he might be unrestrained, crazy, or even enthusiastic — like someone who's wild about cabaret music. The term ""to run wild"" means to grow unrestrained, undisciplined, like a wild animal or an imagination that isn't held back by rules.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U06_1920,"<ul><li>A wound is a serious injury, especially a deep cut through the skin. But things like pride and feelings can also get wounded.</li><li>Wounds are serious: we're talking a lot worse than just a scrape or booboo. Just about all the meanings of this word have to do with being hurt. If you got stabbed, you got a stab wound. Soldiers in battle get a lot of wounds from enemies. If someone told you to shut up, they might wound your feelings. If you slipped in a puddle in front of your friends, that might wound your pride.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1921,"<ul><li>If you are trying to fit in, you are trying to assimilate.</li><li>Imported from Latin, assimilate has the word similar within it and in fact, means ""to become like something else."" If someone moves to another country, he or she will need to assimilate by adapting to and taking in the language, culture and customs of the new place. You can also turn the phrase around to say that a country assimilates immigrants, which means that a place accepts immigrants and allows them to adapt easily. In scientific use, the body assimilates nutrients as a part of digestion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1922,"<ul><li>To attempt is to make an effort. You may attempt to read a book, but if you fail, no harm. If you attempt to jump from one building to the next and fail . . . . Ouch.</li><li>The word attempt can also be used as a noun. It's an honest effort to do something. Your attempt to bake a birthday cake may look like a disaster, but the birthday boy will appreciate the effort anyway. The noun attempt can also mean an attack on a person or place, but in this case, it's best to hope that the attempt is not on your life. And never, ever attempt that sort of thing at home!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1923,"<ul><li>A case is a specific instance or example of something. Your teacher might say, ""In your case, I think you should go right into the calculus class.""</li><li>A case is one particular situation — and it's also a legal term for a court proceeding, and a medical term for the details of one specific patient. Another kind of case is a bag that holds or covers something, like a laptop case or a cellphone case. When case is a verb, it means ""to scope out a location for burglarizing it later."" These various meanings come from two Latin roots: casus, ""chance or occasion,"" and capsa, ""box.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1924,"<ul><li>To cease is to stop or end. Your gym teacher may have trained the class so well that all chattering will cease every time she blows her whistle.</li><li>Cease comes from the Old French cesser, which means ""come to an end,"" ""go away,"" ""give up,"" or ""yield."" Although cease often appears in the past tense with ""-ed,"" cease is common for talking about things as they come to an end. A dead plant has ceased living, and if you cease watering the rest of the plants, they will cease to exist too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1925,"<ul><li>When you're in danger, it seems likely that you might get hurt. Your mom might warn you that if you don't wear your bicycle helmet, you're in danger of getting injured.</li><li>A baby bird teetering on the edge of its nest is in danger, and a driver whose car stalls on railroad tracks is also in danger. When something unpleasant might happen,  you can also use the word danger: ""We were in danger of running out of guacamole before the party ended."" Danger can also be a precarious or perilous place, as when you step up on the curb on a busy street, out of danger.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1926,"<ul><li>Something that's shocking and distressing is devastating. Watching the local ice cream shop burn to the ground would be devastating to many neighborhood kids.</li><li>Incredibly destructive events like earthquakes are devastating, although anything that's tragic, even on a personal level, can also be devastating. It's also used informally to mean incredibly affecting or impressive, like a photographer's devastating images of urban poverty. This meaning came into use in the late 1800s — before that, devastating came right from the Latin word devastare, ""to lay waste completely.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1927,"<ul><li>When there's diversity, there's variety. Often, this word is used for diversity of race, class, or gender.</li><li>To have diversity, you need a mix of whatever you're talking about. If you like science fiction, romantic comedies, cartoons, and action movies, then you like a diversity of types of films. If you like nothing but kung fu films, then you don't like a diversity of films. No matter what kind of diversity you're talking about, there needs to be a real mix, kind of like a huge box of Crayolas.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1928,"<ul><li>If you're visiting your friend in California and her house starts to shake, you might be experiencing an earthquake, which is the shaking of the surface of the earth that happens when there's movement deep underground.</li><li>Earthquake is one of those words that means exactly what it sounds like: the earth is quaking. Earthquakes happen along ""fault lines,"" the places where the big plates of the earth meet and rub up against each other during volcanic activities. We also use earthquake metaphorically, to talk about something that causes a violent upheaval.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1929,"<ul><li>An animal that is endangered is close to extinction — meaning there aren't very many of that type of animal left in the world.</li><li>This word is used mostly to describe animal species that are not doing very well: animals usually become endangered because of over hunting or the destruction of their habitat. Environmental groups and animal-lovers try to help endangered species survive. Outside of the animal kingdom, you can say anything that seems to be dying out is endangered, like good manners, phone booths, or the art of letter writing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1930,"<ul><li>Extinction is when all members of a particular group die. Most often, we use it to discuss animal species. Many fear that the tiger is headed for extinction because of development and hunting.</li><li>People are still trying to figure out what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs: many think it was because of an asteroid. When people cut down rain forests, it can lead to the extinction of many species. Although extinction can be natural or unintended, the word can also mean forced, planned killing. Many people refer to the Holocaust as Hitler's attempt to bring about the extinction of the Jews. Languages also face extinction when no one speaks them anymore.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1931,"<ul><li>Things that last forever never come to an end — they continue endlessly. An experience that changes you forever alters you in ways that will last the rest of your life.</li><li>The adverb forever literally means ""eternally,"" so when you promise, ""I'll love you forever."" you mean it. You can also use forever in a less literal, more exaggerated way: ""It is taking forever for the bus to get here,"" or to mean ""without stopping,"" as when you comment that the rain can't continue forever. The word combines for and ever, which stems from the Old English æfre, ""always.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1932,"<ul><li>Generally means ""usually"" or ""broadly."" If something is generally true, it is usually true. If you generally dislike birthday celebrations, don’t be mad when no one throws you a party.</li><li>If something is right generally, then it's right most of the time, though perhaps not in every case. Generally, dogs are more playful than cats. Generally, young people are healthier than old people. Generally, people like music. This word is handy when you need to say something that is true for most, but not all, people or things. This word helps you to generalize.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1933,"<ul><li>Genocide refers to the systematic destruction of a race or cultural group. In the Rwandan genocide of 1994, members of one ethnic group, the Hutus, killed some 850,000 Tutsis in an attempt to wipe them out completely.</li><li>Genocide was coined in 1944 by a Polish-Jewish scholar named Raphael Lemkin in response to the Holocaust.  In 1948, the United Nations defined genocide as any of several acts (including murder) ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group...""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1934,"<ul><li>When you hit someone, you smack or strike them — either with an object or with your hand. If you're frustrated about how slowly the traffic is moving, you might hit the dashboard of your car with your fist. Ouch.</li><li>A boxer can hit a punching bag, and you can slip and hit your head on a chair. Other kinds of hits include bombs, bullets, or missiles striking targets; assassins or ""hitmen"" killing someone for pay; and reaching a certain goal, like when you hit a high note or your income hits six figures. You can also colloquially ""hit the road,"" or get going; and ""hit up"" your friend for five dollars, or ask to borrow it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1935,"<ul><li>The verb to lose means something has gone missing. Maybe it's your car keys. Maybe it's points in a game. Maybe it's the love of your life. Sorry about that.</li><li>You can physically lose something by misplacing it, or you can lose your pride in a competition. You can lose a game, you can lose your library book, you can lose money, you can lose your business, you can lose sight of your child, you can even lose your mind — basically, you can lose just about anything. Losing something is usually not a good thing, unless it's that annoying boyfriend or weight.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1936,"<ul><li>The word native has to do with where you're from. You're native to the country where you were born, and places have native plants and animals too.</li><li>Things that are native are indigenous — they were born there. This is where the term Native Americans comes from — they were on this land before Europeans came over. Native plants were originally in a place — they weren't transplanted. The same is true of native animals. Sometimes people born in a place are called natives, as in ""You are a native of Cleveland."" When you see the word native, think ""born there.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1937,"<ul><li>A percent is part of something, split into a hundred pieces. For example, fifty percent of forty is twenty.</li><li>You'll hear a lot about percent and percentages in math. A percent can go from 0 percent to 100 percent. A percent is calculated by comparing a part of something compared to the whole. A baseball player's batting average is a percent. Athletes are known for talking about numbers that are impossible, like ""I gave 110 percent!"" You can do that in slang, but don't try it in math class.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1938,"<ul><li>A reason explains why you do something. The reason you go to school is to learn things (and because it's the law).</li><li>Reason usually has to do with thought and logic, as opposed to emotion. If people think you show good reason, or are reasonable, it means you think things through. If people think you have a good reason for doing something, it means you have a motive that makes sense. Reason can also be a verb. You might reason something out, which means that you look at all sides of the issue and then and decide what to do.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1939,"<ul><li>If you are writing a report for school, you are probably relying on a few references, or sources, for information. Or, if you are applying for a job, you may count on a reference from a previous boss to help you get the job.</li><li>Good references are sometimes necessary to either get a job or to get a job done well. A reference is someone you can rely on to put in a good word for you when applying for a job. Or, a reference might be an outside source you use in a research paper. Don't  forget: if you reference outside work, be sure to mention it in your bibliography or ""list of references"" so you don't get accused of plagiarism. Give credit where it's due.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U07_1940,"<ul><li>Use the adjective urban to refer to cities or people who live in cities. It carries a suggestion of grittiness––urban style involves darker colors.</li><li>The terms city and town are sometimes used inconsistently. If it is large enough, a town is considered to be an urban area. Communities where people live outside cities are called suburban. Urban is from a Latin adjective formed from urbs ""city.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1941,"<ul><li>When things burn, they're on fire. People who live in the country sometimes burn leaves and brush, setting big piles alight until they're reduced to ash.</li><li>A house can burn to the ground, and you can burn a stick of incense or a candle with a tiny flame. Another way things burn is from the heat of the sun, as your pale skin burns if you lie on a beach in your bathing suit with no sunblock. Yet another thing that burns is energy, whether it's a motorcycle that burns too much gasoline or a child who burns excess energy by jumping on a trampoline.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1942,"<ul><li>Check: Small word, loads of different meanings. One of the most common is ""to inspect or verify."" You might check the oven to see if your cookies are done.</li><li>A few of the many meanings of check: As a noun: the act of restraining power or action; a pattern of squares resembling a checkerboard; a restaurant bill; a financial instrument payable to the named bearer (from your checkbook); a mark indicating that something's been noted or finished. As a verb: to crack on the surface; to slow or delay growth; to obstruct your hockey opponent; to hand over for inventory and safekeeping, especially baggage on a plane.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1943,"<ul><li>A coconut is a large, nut-like fruit that grows high in trees. Coconuts have very hard shells and sweet, white flesh inside.</li><li>The white, flaked coconut you can buy in a bag at the grocery store is a processed form of the coconut fruit. Coconuts are large brown balls that must be cut or sawed open — inside the shell is the coconut meat, and clear coconut water. To use coconut for baking, it has to first be grated and, often, sweetened. The word comes from coco, ""grinning face,"" in Portuguese, which may refer to the three face-like holes in a coconut shell.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1944,"<ul><li>If you have epilepsy, you have a central nervous system disorder that may cause you to lose consciousness and have convulsions.</li><li>The noun epilepsy comes from the Greek word epilēpsia, which itself means seizure. Not all seizures are caused by epilepsy, but an epileptic seizure occurs when a strong electrical disturbance occurs in the brain. The severity and intensity of the seizures depend on many factors and are unique to each person. It may be possible to control seizures through medication, although not everyone with epilepsy will respond to medication. People with uncontrolled epilepsy should not drive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1945,"<ul><li>Fat is a form of body tissue on animals. It’s a squishy layer that stores energy and protects organs. Fat is also an adjective meaning chubby or thick, as in a fat piglet or a fat wallet full of money.</li><li>Some foods, like butter or avocado, have fat. Deep fried chocolate bars have a lot of fat. Humans, and other animals, need to consume some fat to maintain optimal health and absorb certain vitamins. The word fat can be applied not just to people, animals, or deep-fried food, but to any inanimate object that is notably big. Your brother likes reading comics, while you prefer fat books like War and Peace and The Complete Works of Shakespeare.</li></ul>"

You gain knowledge by attending philosophy lectures and reading books.</li><li>When you gain something, you acquire it or add to what you already have. You can gain friends by joining clubs, and you can gain weight by eating ice cream every day. Gain is also a noun, which you can use to talk about what you've gained, like the health gain you get from cutting back on that ice cream. The root of gain is the Old French gaaignier, ""to earn, trade, or capture.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1947,"<ul><li>Glucose is simple sugar. It's all kinds of sugar, and it's in your blood, and your body needs it for energy. Most Americans sadly consume far more glucose than necessary, and have enlarged gluteus maximus muscles to show for it.</li><li>The word glucose is based on an ancient Greek word gleukos which meant ""sweet delightful wine."" When you're popping one glucose-laden Girl Scout Cookie after another into your mouth, you certainly do feel that delight. You'll probably see the word glucose plenty in biochemistry textbooks. Glucose needs to be in your blood, and a healthy balance of it in your body is indeed as delightful as wine to those ancient Greeks.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1948,"<ul><li>Use the adjective high to describe something with a great elevation. If you want to see a really high mountain, you should visit Mount Everest.</li><li>You can also use high to describe a sound or musical note that is elevated in pitch. Some stores use a high-pitched buzzing sound to keep teenagers from loitering. The noise drives teens crazy, but it doesn't bother their parents, because adults can't hear the high frequency. High also means a state of euphoria. After you win a first place medal at the swim meet, you might be on a high for days.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1949,"<ul><li>To keep means to have and hold on to something — like to keep your wallet in your pocket. It also means to continue; if you keep hula hooping you’ll break the world record!</li><li>Keep has many senses in English, and shows up in a lot of our common expressions, like “keep out!"" and ""keep your shirt on!"" The word generally has the senses of hold onto, maintain, stay, continue, or protect from harm. Food that will not spoil yet will keep. You can keep a secret, keep a diary, or keep your little sister safe. You can also keep a ritual or religious custom by practicing it –- like to keep kosher. Whatever you do, “just keep going.”</li></ul>"

Don’t ask a known thief to walk your dog while you’re out of town, especially if she is known as the “Poodle Poacher.”</li><li>When you know something, it’s in your memory and awareness. When something is known, you know it! Technically, known is the past participle of know. Cigarettes are known to cause cancer. Martin Luther King is known as a hero to Americans. Cassius Clay is known as Muhammad Ali.  If you stay out late and get in trouble, you should’ve known better. Something known is established, and people don't have reason to doubt it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1951,"<ul><li>Your liver is an internal organ that does the important job of filtering toxins out of blood as it flows from your digestive tract to the rest of your body. All vertebrates (animals with spines) have a liver.</li><li>In humans, the liver sits in the upper right-hand side of the abdominal cavity, nestled just above the stomach. Livers are powerful organs, able to break down harmful substances and remove them from your system, produce bile that allows you to digest fat, help your blot to clot, and much more. Many people consider the livers of certain animals to be a delicious delicacy.</li></ul>"

Something that's low is short or shallow.</li><li>Things that are less than usual can be described with the adjective low. You might be low on gas in your car, for example, or wake up with a low amount of energy. A low ceiling can be dangerous for a very tall person, and a low voice can barely be heard. You can also talk about a gloomy mood as being low. And when cows moo, whether they're feeling low or not, you can cay that they low.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1953,"<ul><li>The noun management means ""the act of directing or controlling things,"" like your management of five-year-olds that included fun time, quiet time, and clean-up time.</li><li>Management can be the people in charge of running a business, who have employees who report to them, or the work those leaders do. Good management is a combination of people skills, shrewd business plans, and probably a little luck, too. Outside of business, management can describe anything you direct, like the management of your health by eating right, exercising, seeing your doctor regularly, and getting enough sleep.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1954,"<ul><li>The adjective metabolic describes anything relating to the processes in the body that change food into energy. The high metabolic rate of an endurance athlete requires them to eat enormous meals.</li><li>Metabolic processes are incredibly complicated, and they happen at the cellular level in human (and non-human) bodies. Turning calories from food into energy which keeps a body moving is just the simplest way to think about metabolic activity. When you consider the change that occurs (a peanut butter and jelly sandwich transforming into energy you use to play a soccer game), the root of metabolic makes total sense: it's the Greek metabole, ""a change.""</li></ul>"

You might dress your salad with olive oil and use motor oil in your car's engine; just don't confuse the two!</li><li>There's the oil you put in your car or use to oil a rusty lock — then there's the oil you heat to stir fry vegetables or whisk with vinegar to make salad dressing. Chemically, these oils have a lot in common, from their tendency to avoid water to their slipperiness to the ease with which they catch on fire. Still, you'd never want to toss a bowl of spaghetti with motor oil — stick to olive oil instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U08_1956,"<ul><li>An olive is a very small fruit, although you probably think of it as a savory snack. You might find an olive on a salad, on a pizza, or even on a toothpick in your martini.</li><li>Olives are so naturally bitter that they're basically inedible unless they've been treated — cured with lye or salt, and then fermented. In addition to the olives you see in jars on grocery store shelves, olive trees yield an expensive, durable wood; and of course, olive oil. You can also describe the yellowish-green color of an unripe olive as olive. And when someone offers ""an olive branch,"" they are trying to make peace or come to an understanding.</li></ul>"

You could praise an actor's performance in a movie, but this word extends to other kinds of work and accomplishments as well. If you're failing math, your performance is below par. An athlete can get in trouble for taking performance-enhancing drugs: drugs that make their performance better.

Your neighbor who just finished training to be a fireman probably looks much more powerful than he used to.</li><li>We use powerful for many different senses of ""strong."" A powerful medicine is very effective. A powerful politician has more influence than most politicians. A powerful dog could probably knock you down.

You can starch your shirt by adding starch, which is a white powder, to the rinse water. You can also get the kind of starch that comes as a spray, which you squirt on your shirt while you're ironing it.

The end.""</li><li>Summary is a noun, and ""summery"" is an adjective, but they sound alike and both describe something short. A summer feels like a short piece of a long year, and a summary is a short statement about a longer piece. When a long speech or writing needs retelling in a short amount of time, a summary conveys the meaning in fewer words. Often a book cover has a summary of what's inside, and an introduction has a summary of the main points in a chapter.</li></ul>"

Doctors are trained to think in this way, as are scientists and engineers.</li><li>Analytic derives from analysis, which means a thorough and detailed dissection of an object or an idea. Being analytic means that you think things through carefully and thoroughly. It may be more fun to fly by the seat of your pants and make all your decisions based on your gut instinct, but in the end, being analytic is safer.</li></ul>"

Any people outside of these criteria are some other word.</li><li>The origins of bachelor are unclear, but some similar Latin words are baccalāris (“farm hand”), baccalārium (“dairy farm”), and bacca (“cow”).  Maybe some bachelors spent a lot of time milking cows before getting married in the olden days.

Anxious parents might defend using flashcards with toddlers as ""nurturing their cognitive development.""</li><li>The adjective, cognitive, comes from the Latin cognoscere ""to get to know"" and refers to the ability of the brain to think and reason as opposed to feel. A child's cognitive development is the growth in his or her ability to think and solve problems. Many English words that involve knowing and knowledge have cogn- in them such as cognizant ""aware of"" and recognize ""to know someone in the present because you knew them from the past.""</li></ul>"

You shouldn't give yourself a pedicure while driving because it might result in a collision, wrecking your car and spoiling your toenail polish to boot.</li><li>Collision comes from the Latin col-, ""together,"" and lædĕre, ""to hurt by striking."" When a train hits a car, that's a collision. An asteroid hurtling toward earth is on a ""collision course"" with our planet. Collision also works for abstract conflicts that get violent or hurt your brain somehow, like the collision between two politicians during a debate, or the collision of colors in your outfit.</li></ul>"

If you can carry a heavy tray of food and store a table's worth of orders in your head, you are probably a competent waiter.</li><li>The opposite of competent is incompetent — an incompetent travel agent might send you to Bahrain when you requested Britain. But competent on its own can sometimes be a veiled criticism, with the implication that someone competent is just going to through the motions — you'd rather have someone inspired on the job. In legal language, competent describes someone who has the mental capacity to take part in a trial or sign a contract.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U09_1967,"<ul><li>A diploma is a document people receive when they graduate from a school or program. It is a symbol of academic success.

People receive high school and college diplomas, which they usually receive during a graduation ceremony. You could also get a diploma for a shorter series of classes in something like pottery, skydiving, or marksmanship. Even a dog could get a diploma for passing obedience school. Any time someone gets a diploma, you can be sure they finished a course or program of learning.</li></ul>"

You might even be moving so much faster than the rest of your class, you're put into a special, accelerated math program.</li><li>Excel derives from the Latin excellere, which is all about going beyond the high. Someone who excels at the violin might practice five hours a day because they are striving for excellence, meaning outstanding-ness. You could describe their performance as excellent, or fantastic. That doesn't mean you yourself want to practice five hours a day. Excel means to stand out, and some of us are pretty happy standing right where we are.</li></ul>"

Geology tells us where lakes once were, where volcanoes erupted, where glaciers pushed up mountains and then melted. Geologists — people who study geology — tell us where to find oil, coal and diamonds and then they explain how they got there. If you find the natural world beautiful and interesting, you might enjoy studying geology.</li></ul>"

If you are an integral part of the team, it means that the team cannot function without you.</li><li>An integral part is necessary to complete the whole. In this sense, the word essential is a near synonym. In mathematics, there are integrals of functions and equations. Integral is from Middle English, from Medieval Latin integralis ""making up a whole,"" from Latin  integer ""untouched, entire.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U09_1971,"<ul><li>Intellect is how much intelligence you have. Einstein was known for having a great intellect. Mickey Mouse's friend Goofy has almost no intellect to speak of.</li><li>Intellect is the mental equivalent of athletic ability or fashion sense, so someone is an intellect if they have great intellectual ability just as an athlete is someone who has great athletic ability.  Intellect is something everyone has in some degree. If someone talks down to you, it's an insult to your intellect. Your teacher might say you have a sharp intellect if you have the intellect to figure out  difficult problems. An intellectual is a person who has a lot of knowledge and prefers to think about things on an abstract or theoretical level rather than a practical one.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U09_1972,"<ul><li>Unless you win the lottery, you will probably need a job, or employment where you do work for pay. There are also non-paying jobs: it might be your job to wash the dishes after dinner.</li><li>Job and work are often synonymous and unfortunately often have a negative connotation meaning “toil."" Other meanings of job that are negative involve damaging events or crimes. When you wrecked your car, someone might have said, ""You did a real job on that;"" or, when you convinced your sister to hand over her allowance, you might have referred to it as a ""con job.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U09_1973,"<ul><li>If you have a keen interest in something, you are really, really into it. Keen is an adjective that describes something that is intense, sharp, or focused.</li><li>The word keen comes from the Old English word cene that translates to ""bold and brave"" and while the spelling is now really different, the sounds are similar. Variations of keen as being ""bold"" and ""strong"" show up in other languages, but only English has the meaning of ""sharp"" — relating to ""an edge or blade."" Keen has a lot of close — and brutal — synonyms, such as caustic, cutting, piercing, and penetrating. It can also be used as a verb to mean ""express grief or pain out loud.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U09_1974,"<ul><li>The minimum is the lowest or smallest amount possible or acceptable. If you do the minimum amount of work at your job, you might not get fired — but you definitely won't get promoted.</li><li>Minimum is Latin for smallest, so clearly English speakers have done less than the minimum amount of messing with the meaning of this word. Obviously, the opposite is maximum. At minimum, you should know that the word means the smallest limit of something. At most, you should be able to talk about its Latin roots.</li></ul>"

Radioactive energy, or radiation, is made up of active particles or electromagnetic waves. Nuclear waste is radioactive, but so are more ordinary things, like cell phones and the food we eat. The French word for it is radio-actif, which was invented by Pierre and Marie Curie, who combined radiationem, Latin for ""a shining"" with actif, French for ""active.""</li></ul>"

In physics, relativity refers to Einstein's theory that time and space are not absolute.</li><li>If you believe there are absolute, correct answers to everything, you probably don't like relativity, which is the opposite of absolutism. According to relativity, things aren't good or bad in themselves; they only have significance in relation to other things. In physics, relativity is about how even time and space aren't absolute, objective facts. For example, time partially depends on our perceptions of it: time is relative.</li></ul>"

Sociology attempts to explain how a society works, whether that society is a native tribe in the Amazon or an old folks’ home in Nebraska.</li><li>Sociology is one of the social — sometimes called soft — sciences. It's the study of human actions and interactions. People who study sociology — sociologists — look at how people interact in groups and what kinds of religions, governments, schools, and other ways of life they create. While psychology looks mostly at individuals, sociology looks at people in groups.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U09_1979,"<ul><li>Something theoretical is concerned with theories and hypotheses — it's not necessarily based on real life or meant to be applied to real life.</li><li>Theoretical things are based on theory and ideas, while practical ones are based on practice. Theoretical thinking can be really helpful when you're trying to imagine something or problem-solve, but your theories should always be tested out in the practical world. As philosopher Bertrand Russell said, “The theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of philosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals, or to savages, or even to most civilized men.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U09_1980,"<ul><li>Weak is the opposite of strong. Muscles, arguments, defenses, and coffee can all be weak — and when they are, it's not good.</li><li>Anything weak is lacking in strength or power. If your muscles are weak, you can't lift much. If your will power is weak, you give up easily. Food and drinks with little flavor are weak, and an argument that is flimsy is weak. Whenever anything is lacking or not what it should be, it's weak. And if you come across something really lame — like a dumb TV show — you could say, ""That's so weak.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1981,"<ul><li>The boss, the head honcho, the person in charge: An administrator is the person responsible for managing things and running the show.</li><li>Administrators are often found directing government agencies, organizing institutions, or leading school departments. They're the decision makers and the planners, the people who put in place or administer the rules and guidelines. In other words, the administrator's office is probably the last place you want to end up if you're in trouble.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1982,"<ul><li>You know you're driving through an affluent neighborhood when you see large houses, perfect landscaping, and expensive cars. Use affluent to describe wealthy people or areas.</li><li>In Middle English, affluent meant ""abundant, flowing,"" from Old French, from Latin affluēns, from affluere ""to abound in,"" from the prefix ad- ""to, at"" plus fluere ""to flow."" The meaning of ""abundant, flowing"" is still seen in phrases such as ""affluent prose."" But mostly, when you use the word affluent, the thing understood to be flowing is cash.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1983,"<ul><li>An audit is a thorough counting, review, or assessment of a situation or collection of things. Before baking cookies, you'd better make an audit of the ingredients available to see whether there is enough sugar and butter.</li><li>The most common use of the word audit is with the Internal Revenue Service, which sometimes performs an audit of a taxpayer’s finances to see whether that taxpayer has accurately reported his or her income. It can also be used in this context as a verb. It's easy to get nervous if the IRS is planning to audit you! You can also audit a class if you attend but don't pay for it. Just don't think that you'll get credit towards graduation from that.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1984,"<ul><li>When you design a machine to complete a process once done by a human, you automate the process. Standardized tests once had to be graded by hand, now they're automated, i.e. done by computers.</li><li>If you automate a factory, workers might lose jobs to robots and machines. A century ago, if you did laundry, you had to turn the clothes in the drum by hand. It was really hard work, so hard that in many families one day was set aside as laundry day and everyone had to help. In 1937, the first electric, or automated, washer was sold, with a motor that turned the drum. Since then, the job has become much easier, though most of us still find it a chore.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1985,"<ul><li>You pay a bribe to get someone to do something they wouldn't do otherwise. It's usually dishonest and often criminal.</li><li>Bribes can be utterly corrupt and illegal — like when you offer a bribe to a politician so she'll make a decision in your favor. On the other hand, a bribe can be somewhat benign — like when your mom bribes you with an ice cream if you play with your little brother. When you bribe someone, you can say you're ""greasing their palm.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1986,"<ul><li>If someone or something is corrupt, they’re broken morally or in some other way. Corrupt people perform immoral or illegal acts for personal gain, without apology. Corrupt politicians take bribes and deny it.</li><li>When you corrupt someone, you convince them to do something wrong or even illegal. If you talk your little brother into stealing cookies from the cookie jar, you're corrupting him. Something corrupt is rotten, spoiled, or out of commission, like a file that makes your computer crash. A corrupt person — a criminal, a crook, or a cookie thief — brings society down with immoral and dishonest behavior. Corrupt goes back to the Latin roots cor-, ""altogether,"" and rumpere, ""break.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1987,"<ul><li>If you dispose of something, you get rid of it. Don't want that sweatshirt with the clown's face on it? Give it away, throw it out, even sell it — these are all ways to dispose of that awful shirt.</li><li>The verb dispose comes from the Latin word disponere, meaning “put in order,” “arrange,” or “distribute"" — like when you dispose volunteers to collect trash at a park. The word of usually follows dispose when it means ""getting rid of something."" Another meaning is ""make willing or open to something,"" like your childhood love of reading that disposes you to becoming a life-long reader.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1988,"<ul><li>The main office of an organization is its headquarters. The headquarters of your favorite video game company might be in New York.</li><li>Companies, clubs, and religious groups all have headquarters, or a central administrative location. Militaries also have headquarters, although the word has a slightly different meaning in that context — military headquarters are where commanders and their staffs live and work. The word has been around since the 1600's, from the ""most important or principal"" meaning of head and quarters, originally ""military dwelling place,"" and later ""lodgings.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1989,"<ul><li>If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she might offer to treat you to ice cream after as an incentive. An incentive is something that stimulates you to take action or work harder.</li><li>This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum, from incentivus, ""stimulating."" In Latin, incentivus meant ""setting the tune,"" from incinere, ""to sing."" The related English verb is incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early 1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1990,"<ul><li>The infrastructure is the basic foundation or underlying framework of an organization or system. In your house, the infrastructure is the system of beams, weight-bearing walls and the foundation that keeps it standing.</li><li>Infrastructure often refers to the equipment and structures required by the military or by a country or region. Roads, bridges, and school buildings are part of our nation's infrastructure, and are necessary for the continued growth of our communities. This word was formed as a compound in English, using the prefix infra- ""below, underneath.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1991,"<ul><li>To legislate is to make laws. If you thought there should be a law that all money should be pink instead of green, you might write to your congresswoman with a suggestion to legislate your idea.</li><li>Formal government bodies legislate. So, while you might create a rule at home to ban phone calls at dinner, the House of Representatives would legislate communication regulations during meals. Legislate may seem like a tricky word, but you can easily remember the meaning if you notice that the word begins with the same leg as the word legal does; both words relate to the law.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1992,"<ul><li>Something legitimate is the real deal — according to the law.</li><li>Legitimate has other variations of meaning. To legitimate something is to make it legal, either by passing a law or publicly recognizing it as in accordance with the law. A government can be legitimized by being invited to world talks, or a movie by winning a prestigious award.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1993,"<ul><li>To manipulate something means to handle it skillfully, like the way a sculptor manipulates clay or a really good politician works a crowd.</li><li>The verb manipulate evolved from manipulation, which back in the 1700s referred to a method of digging ore. So manipulating something originally only meant moving or arranging it by hand or mechanically. It wasn't until 1864 that people started using the word manipulate to describe someone exerting mental or emotional influence on others.</li></ul>"

Goods that can be bought or sold are merchandise, and so are items connected with a particular movie or music group — like the t-shirts you can buy at a rock concert's merchandise booth. Merchandise is also a verb, meaning ""to promote or advertise"" — ""Retail stores merchandise goods using displays, signs, or mannequins.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1995,"<ul><li>If you buy a pair of jeans at your neighborhood Chique Boutique, you’re buying retail, but if you go to China and buy a boatload of jeans directly from the manufacturer, you’re buying wholesale, which is the opposite of retail.</li><li>If you make your living growing flowers, you may have a retail shop where you sell to people buying flowers for themselves, and you may also have a wholesale business, where you sell flowers to florists and supermarkets who sell your flowers to their customers. As you have probably figured out, the retail shops — the florists and supermarkets — add their own markup to the wholesale price you charge them, so they can make a profit, too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1996,"<ul><li>Revenue is money earned by a business, or income received by the government from taxes. The government is always interested in dreaming up new sources of revenue, and so is the average head of a company unless she doesn't want to be the head anymore.</li><li>Revenue is from a French word meaning ""to return or come back,"" and dollar returns are always a welcome thing. Declining advertising revenue will doom your website, no matter how great it is. If your lemonade stand is not making a profit, you might consider lowering costs. Maybe you could get cheaper lemonade mix? Or you might look for more creative and exciting ways to increase revenue––like raiding the pantry for cookies you can sell as well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1997,"<ul><li>Rubbish is a synonym for garbage or trash. The word is more commonly used by speakers of British English than by speakers of American English.</li><li>The noun rubbish also means writing or speech that is worthless, untrue, or nonsense, especially in British English. Your teacher might tell you that your paper thesis is a load of rubbish if it states that Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt were aliens sent from another planet to ""fix"" World War II. In British slang, rubbish is also a verb that means to criticize strongly. Don't be surprised when the professor rubbishes your paper — he's a well-known Churchill scholar.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1998,"<ul><li>A subsidy is a grant of financial assistance. Many school districts, for example, offer a subsidy to low-income families for book fees and lunch costs. The family pays a set amount and the district makes up the difference.</li><li>The noun subsidy comes from French and Latin roots that mean ""help and aid."" Subsidies are most often offered by the government, but individuals can offer subsidies as well. ""The parents offered to give a subsidy for students to go on the ski trip. The deal was that if the kids earned half the money, the parents would pay for the other half.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_1999,"<ul><li>A transaction is any kind of action involved in conducting business, or an interaction between people. When you go to the bank, fill out a form, and deposit your paycheck, you make a transaction.</li><li>An important business deal can be called a transaction, particularly the buying or selling of goods, but you can call any exchange with another person a transaction. There are transactions involving money, ideas, and even e-mail. The Latin root transactionem describes an agreement or accomplishment. This led to a mid-15th century version of transaction that described the adjustment of a dispute.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U10_2000,"<ul><li>Violate is a verb that describes actions that show no respect for people, laws, property, and customs. Drivers violate the law when they fail to stop at red lights, and people violate your privacy when they eavesdrop on your personal conversations.</li><li>Violate comes from the Latin word violatus which means ""to break,"" as in a promise or oath. As members of our society, we make unspoken promises — to follow all laws, to help people if we can, or at the very least, not hurt them. So when we violate — laws, property, people's abilities to live safe, peaceful lives — we break the promises that come with being lawful citizens.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2001,"<ul><li>Before you try to sell your car, you should ask an expert to assess its value — once you know what it's worth, it's easier to find a fair price. When you assess a matter, you make a judgment about it.</li><li>The verb assess has the general meaning of determining the importance or value of something. It also has a few specialized uses having to do with amounts of money, such as fines, fees, and taxes. It can mean to set the value of property for purposes of taxation, or to charge a person or business a tax or fee. Assess comes from Anglo-French usage, and is ultimately derived from the Latin verb assidēre, ""to sit as a judge.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2002,"<ul><li>Things that might astonish you: the discovery of life on another planet, a death-defying performance, and the number of dinosaurs a six-year old child can name. To astonish is to amaze and astound.</li><li>Remember that astonish means more than surprised. It carries with it a feeling of being truly impressed. Astonish derives from the Latin tonare 'thunder.' When you are astonished, you're thunderstruck. If you plan to astonish someone, you might say before hand, ""Wait until you see this. It's going to knock your socks off.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2003,"<ul><li>Commence is a fancy way of saying ""begin."" Your invitation to a formal wedding might note, ""The ceremony will commence at noon.""</li><li>If a congressman wants to start a meeting to vote on an important bill, he might say, ""This meeting will begin immediately."" Or, he could make the same statement in a more formal way by saying, ""This meeting will commence immediately."" Interestingly enough, while the word commence means to start, a commencement ceremony marks the end of a college career.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2004,"<ul><li>Essence is whatever most sums up the heart and soul of something, its truest most indispensable qualities. The essence of Las Vegas is poker chips and dreams; the essence of Johnny Cash is black clothing and country music.</li><li>Essence can be a physical detail, or, just as commonly, the abstract idea or meaning of something. The essence of Lady Chatterly's Lover might be its revolutionary eroticism, or the essence of religion its devotion to God. Essence can also mean the concentrate obtained from a flower or plant for flavoring. If you've chewed strawberry-flavored bubblegum you're probably amazed at how it truly is the very essence of strawberries.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2005,"<ul><li>When you extract something, you remove it from a larger whole. You can extract a passage from a book, or a liquid essence from a vanilla bean—vanilla extract.</li><li>Ex- means out of, and when you extract, you draw something out of something else. When listening to a complicated and long-winded story, it can be difficult to extract the truly meaningful details.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2006,"<ul><li>If something is so great you can hardly believe it, it is fabulous. You can have a fabulous first date or you can make a fabulous dinner.</li><li>These days, fabulous things are mainly wonderful things, but there's another meaning related to fable: some fabulous things can't — or at least shouldn't — be believed. If you friend claims to be a personal friend of the entire Chicago Bulls, but has never been to Chicago, that's a fabulous story that's probably not true. Also, any story involving a unicorn or wizard is fabulous in a literal sense. A great fantasy story would be fabulous in every way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2007,"<ul><li>When something is done in haste, it's done fast, and often with carelessness. In his haste to finish the paper, he didn't notice he had replaced ""taste"" with ""waste"" during spell-checking, so his title became ""Foods of Our Home State: What a Waste!""</li><li>The old saying goes ""haste makes waste,"" and when you try to do things too quickly, sometimes you do them wrong or have to do them all over again. You can use the noun haste for things done with extraordinary speed and often in a situation where there's pressure to perform or complete a task. ""In her haste to catch the train she ran six blocks, but when she boarded, she noticed she was wearing one blue tennis shoe and one red one.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2008,"<ul><li>An impulse is a sudden force or desire — this could be an electrical impulse, or an impulse to get some pizza.</li><li>If you act on a sudden feeling or thought, you’re following an impulse. That's like a whim: an impulse isn't something you've given a lot of thought. Another meaning of impulse is an electrical charge or pulse. Electrical impulses are coursing through wires all through your house every day. Both kinds of impulses make things happen. The electrical impulse keeps the refrigerator going, and then you have an impulse to eat all the ice cream in the fridge.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2009,"<ul><li>When you inhibit something, you block it or hold it back. If you put plants in a dark room, you inhibit their growth. A teacher who mocks their students for giving wrong answers inhibits their willingness to speak up in class.</li><li>When you look at the word inhibit, think hinder. Though it sounds like it might be a bad thing to inhibit something else, there is no judgment built into the word. A drug that inhibits the growth of cancer cells would generally be considered a very good thing. While you may wish cancer cells to be inhibited, you probably don't wish it upon your friend's sense of humor or your country's economic growth.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2010,"<ul><li>When you are comparing two things, the first one is known as the former and the second as the latter. For example, George Bush and George W. Bush were both U. S. presidents. The latter was the son of the former.</li><li>The word latter is really a form of later meaning ""more recent"" or ""that which came after."" The latter recording of a band refers to the one made more recently. It also can refer to a later time, near the end. If someone is in the latter stages of a disease, the disease has just about run its course and the person is about to die.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2011,"<ul><li>A molecule is the simplest structural unit of a substance that still keeps the properties of that substance, like a molecule of water. This scientific word also gets used in unscientific ways, as in ""Every single molecule in my body wants that chocolate cupcake!""</li><li>People sometimes confuse molecules with atoms, but a molecule is made up of atoms. A molecule retains the characteristic of the substance it’s from, so a water molecule is still water. An atom only has the characteristics of its element, not the larger composition. For example, a water molecule, H2O, is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2012,"<ul><li>If something is ongoing, it is happening now. If you have an ongoing argument with your neighbor, it means you were arguing before, you’re arguing now, and it looks like you'll be arguing into the future.</li><li>If something is ongoing, it is currently in action. Often in news reports, reference will be made to an ongoing investigation because the police are in the midst of it at the moment of reporting. Ongoing reports are currently in progress as are ongoing repairs. If your teachers say that there will be ongoing testing throughout the year, you won't be done with it until you get out of school.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2013,"<ul><li>Precise means strictly correct or very exact. If you need something to be precise, like the positioning of a safety net for a stunt jump over a canyon, there's no room for error.</li><li>The word precise might make you think of a scientist carefully measuring the mass of a chemical for an experiment or an accountant double checking her calculations. But there's value to being precise in less formal situations as well. When making a grilled cheese sandwich, for example, it’s important that the arrangement of ingredients be precise: place a tomato in each corner and ensure that the cheese covers every inch of bread so that each bite is full of gooey delight.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2014,"<ul><li>The word proximity means nearness or closeness. ""Because of the proximity of our desks, I couldn't help but notice him cheating on the exam.""</li><li>Your favorite thing about your neighborhood of attached row houses might be the proximity of your neighbors — they're really close to you. Proximity comes from the Latin proximus, ""nearest,"" which also gives us approximate, ""close to the actual."" You can use this noun to talk about a physical closeness, or something that's near in time, like the proximity of the months April and May.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2015,"<ul><li>Publicity is a public message whose purpose is to let people know about something, like a concert or a new product.</li><li>If you go around town putting up posters that advertise a community production of ""Annie,"" you are helping with the play's publicity. In the business world, it's common to hear the terms ""publicity campaign"" and ""publicity stunt."" Originally, the word publicity was used to mean ""condition of being public,"" and  it wasn't until 1826 that it took on a marketing or advertising meaning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2016,"<ul><li>A remedy is something that relieves or cures a problem or illness. Aloe vera is a common remedy for sunburn.</li><li>If you're having trouble sleeping, the first remedy you might try is a hot bath and a cup of chamomile tea. If that doesn't help, you may resort to something stronger, like a sedative. If a streetlight shining in your window is part of the problem, you can remedy the situation with some room-darkening shades. But if it's your upstairs neighbors and their all-night partying that's keeping you awake, you may have to consider a legal remedy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2017,"<ul><li>Significance means having the quality of being ""significant"" — meaningful, important. It also refers to the meaning of something. A certain date might have significance because it's your birthday or the anniversary of Princess Di's wedding.</li><li>Significance starts with the word sign for a reason. An item's significance is a sign of its importance. The significance of something can be implicit or explicit — meaning it can be clear or only known with a deeper understanding of the situation. Your perfect score on the Calculus exam might have added significance for people who know that you never even opened your textbook to study.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2018,"<ul><li>For something that comes after something else in time or order, choose the adjective subsequent. If the entire class fails an exam, the teacher will hopefully make subsequent ones a little easier.</li><li>Subsequent comes from the Latin subsequi ""to follow closely"" and means just that - following or coming after. If you say, ""in 1990 and subsequent years,"" it includes 1990, whereas ""the years subsequent to 1990"" do not include it. When you mention a car crash and subsequent traffic jam or a scandal and subsequent investigation, one follows the other in order but a cause and effect relationship is implied too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2019,"<ul><li>Something made of artificial material, not natural items, can be described as synthetic. Some football stadiums have synthetic grass, and a leisure suit from the 1970s might be made of synthetic fabric.</li><li>The adjective synthetic usually describes things created by chemical synthesis (synthetic compound, synthetic drug, synthetic material), but it sometimes describes an emotion that is feigned or not genuine. A person who exudes only synthetic friendliness probably isn't someone you want to hang out with, for example.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U11_2020,"<ul><li>Terminal is a word with many meanings. Depending on how it's used, it can describe a place where passengers end their journey, a computer screen and keyboard, or a life-ending disease.</li><li>As a noun, terminal describes a bus or train station at the end of the line. When your aunt takes the bus into town, you pick her up at the terminal. Her visit becomes very sad when your aunt tells you she's been diagnosed with an illness that's terminal — an adjective meaning she hasn't long to live. This is surprising news, since you've always believed your aunt is a hypochondriac. Now you have to go to your computer terminal and look up her disease.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2021,"<ul><li>Use the adjective acute for when you want to describe something as sharp or extremely serious.</li><li>The word acute is one word; it's not two words, nor does it have anything to do with something small, cuddly, and pretty! Acute really means ""sharp"" or ""severe"" or ""intense"" and modifies certain kinds of angles in geometry or describes a certain kind of illness of short duration. The English word apparently entered the language during the sixteenth century from the Latin root acutus, which means ""sharp"" or ""pointed.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2022,"<ul><li>Aggression is hostile, purposely unfriendly behavior that can sometimes be violent. A motorist who shows aggression for another may follow too closely, honk the horn, or otherwise try to intimidate.</li><li>When someone deliberately tries to make another person feel intimidated or threatened, it's an act of aggression. Forceful, unfriendly behavior towards others is one example of aggression, and one country's hostile action toward another is also a kind of aggression. It's been used since the 1600s to mean ""an unprovoked attack,"" from the Latin root word aggressionem, ""attack,"" and in 1912 aggression was first used to mean generally ""hostile behavior.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2023,"<ul><li>A biography is an account of somebody's life written by somebody else, complete with details of the most important parts.</li><li>These days, anyone, of any age, can be the subject of a biography: Justin Bieber, at the tender age of 17, had one written about his life. A biography is not to be confused with an autobiography, an account of someone's life written by the subject himself. You'll find biographies in printed form (remember books?), but also increasingly in the form of e-books, TV dramatizations, and cinematic ""bio-docs.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2024,"<ul><li>Think of the word boost as meaning ""help up."" Maybe you need a boost getting over a fence (hmm — are you sneaking in or sneaking out?), or maybe you are feeling low and need to boost your spirits — chocolate, anyone?</li><li>Sometimes words appear that really don't have any clear origins. Boost is one of those words, but it's a fun word, and it's thought that maybe it has some connection to boose, a Scots dialect word that carries the idea of a push.  A slang meaning of the word is to sneakily steal, like shoplifting.  You gave your cousin a boost into the window, not knowing he was planning on boosting some sneakers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2025,"<ul><li>To clap is to strike your hands together. After an awesome play, an audience will clap and maybe even stand up and hoot. A clap is also any loud or sharp noise or collision, like a clap of thunder.</li><li>After you see a performance, it's polite to clap — smack your hands together quickly and repeatedly. To clap also means to put something down quickly and with force, like if you clap a plate on a table. Any sharp, loud sound is a clap, like a clap caused by an explosion. Clapping two objects together quickly will cause a clap. All types of claps and clapping involve sharp movements and loud sounds.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2026,"<ul><li>Has the building got columns in front of it? Check. Has the music got lots of strings and horns? Check. Chances are both are classical — representative of a past culture.</li><li>Often classical describes anything from ancient Greek or Roman culture, because, boy, those guys were good. Be careful when using classical and classic; they're not exactly the same. While something classical is usually a classic, it doesn't necessarily work the other way around. A classic is something  exceptional that we tend to judge in a different time frame. A classic rock album? Definitely not made by the ancient Greeks or Romans. So far as we know.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2027,"<ul><li>Compel means to force or drive someone to do something. Even if you don't like toast, when you visit the toast-eating natives of Shrintakook Island, you'll be compelled to eat it, or they will not trust you.</li><li>You don't want to be compelled to go to a classical music concert if you'd rather listen to rap. School officials might be upset if a winter storm compels them to cancel classes, but you'd be okay with that. A compelling mystery forces you to pay attention because you want to find out ""whodunit.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2028,"<ul><li>Use the noun creation to describe bringing something into existence, such as the creation of a new organization or the creation of a cutting-edge computer program.</li><li>Creation often describes the act of producing something for the first time, but it can also refer to the thing that's produced. In this sense, it often describes something involving artistic talent. If you write a short story, you'd probably ask your friends to read your artistic creation. Creation also can be used to refer to the universe in general. If your sister does something remarkable, you might say that in all of creation there's never been a sister like that.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2029,"<ul><li>When you have power over others you are said to have dominance. For years, the British Empire had dominance over much of the world, ruling vast stretches of Africa, India, and Asia.</li><li>In packs of animals, the males will often fight to determine dominance, i.e., who is top dog. Or top lion. This happens in classrooms too, with the teacher needing to establish dominance over unruly students. If your football team has dominance over its league, it means they usually beat—or dominate—most of the other teams in the league.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2030,"<ul><li>Reach for the adjective gorgeous to describe jaw-droppingly beautiful, magnificent people or things.</li><li>Good-looking is one thing. Beautiful is another. But reserve gorgeous for the kind of looks that take your breath away. Some synonyms include resplendent, dazzling, spectacular, and splendid. We know that the word comes from Old French gorgias, meaning ""elegant,"" but beyond that it's hard to say for sure. It might have something to do with fancy necklaces adorning the throat — la gorge in French. If calling someone gorgeous isn't enough, pack some extra punch and say ""drop-dead gorgeous"" instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2031,"<ul><li>If something is inevitable, it will definitely happen, like death or tax season.</li><li>Inevitable comes from the Latin word inevitabilis, which means unavoidable.  If you say something is inevitable, you give the sense that no matter what scheme you come up with to get around it, it's going to happen sooner or later. You can use all the skin products you want, but wrinkles are inevitable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2032,"<ul><li>Use the word, legacy, for something handed down from one generation to the next. A retiring company president might leave a legacy of honesty and integrity.</li><li>Legacy comes from the Latin verb, legare ""to appoint by a last will, send as an ambassador."" Originally, the noun meant ""ambassador"" or ""envoy"" but soon shifted to mean the money and property a person leaves behind in his will. Many university scholarships are funded by the legacies of former students. In recent usage, political leaders are said to be concerned with their legacies, the historically significant achievements of their tenure in office.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2033,"<ul><li>Many people have to agree that a painting or a novel is wonderful, and they usually need to feel that way for years, in order for it to be considered a true masterpiece.</li><li>An artist or writer is generally capable of creating only one masterpiece in her lifetime, if she makes a masterpiece at all. When an art historian or English teacher uses it, the word masterpiece implies a truly sublime, amazing creation. You can also describe something that's simply great as a masterpiece, like the seven-layer chocolate cake your mom baked for your birthday. Masterpiece comes from the Dutch meesterstuk, ""work by which a craftsman attains the rank of master.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2034,"<ul><li>When you're talking about more than one, you're talking about multiple things. A machine with many fixtures has multiple parts. A person that seems like two totally different people on different days might have multiple personalities.</li><li>The word multiple comes from the Latin multiplus meaning ""manifold."" When something exists in multiple forms, it's manifold, or has many kinds. Think of a multiplex theater that can show multiple movies at once. Walk through a garden full of flowers and you'll see multiple kinds of blooms. A multiple is also a number that can be divided into another number without a remainder.  Multiples of five, for example are ten, fifteen, twenty... — you get the picture.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2035,"<ul><li>When you tell a story or describe something out loud, you narrate. You might hire a well-known actor to narrate your documentary film about circus elephants.</li><li>One way to narrate is to comment on or describe visual images — photographs or scenes in a film, for example. You can also narrate a story simply by relaying the details aloud. In books, a character sometimes narrates the story as well. It appears that narration, or the action of telling a story, came before narrate, from the Latin root narrare, ""to tell, relate, or recount,"" or literally, ""to make acquainted with.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2036,"<ul><li>Use the adjective notorious to describe people, places, or things that are famous for a bad reason.</li><li>A good synonym for notorious is infamous; both words mean ""well-known, and not in a good way."" A celebrity convicted of a series of crimes might be referred to as notorious, as might a book that has been banned in several countries. The word originally meant just ""famous"" and could carry either positive or negative connotations. Only in recent centuries did the negative uses start to outweigh the positive ones. In general, you'd rather be famous than notorious — unless you're looking to build a bad reputation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2037,"<ul><li>The overall meaning of the word overall is that it covers all the parts of something. For example, the individual parts don't matter as much as the overall value.</li><li>The word overall is the sum of its parts. Take the word over, meaning ""above,"" and add it to the word all, meaning ""everything"" and you get overall, meaning ""above everything"". But remember, it's an adjective as in the overall impression of the music, the overall effect of the new tax code, the overall direction (as opposed to individual little changes.) Remember that overalls, the clothes you wore as a kid, went ""over all"" your other clothes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2038,"<ul><li>Partiality is the habit of favoring something — taking its part. If your parents always seem to let your little sister off the hook while you get grounded, you could accuse them of partiality in their parenting. They favor your sister over you.</li><li>Partiality is like bias. It means that your favorite person, type of food, or way of operating tends to get priority when you’re making up your mind. A synonym for partiality is favoritism. For this reason, anyone who’s not directly benefiting from your partiality will not appreciate it. It’s unfair!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2039,"<ul><li>Something spontaneous happens when you're least expecting it. Spontaneous things are natural or instinctive, and they happen without warning.</li><li>If you plan to go to a movie and then you go, that's not a spontaneous thing. Ditching the movie at the last minute to go to the park? That's spontaneous. Spontaneous things happen all of a sudden, on the spur of the moment, without being planned. Spontaneous can also refer to things that happen without outside influence. Your parents will be happy if you do your chores spontaneously instead of waiting till they nag you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U12_2040,"<ul><li>Virtue is the quality of being morally good. If you're writing a screenplay and you want it to be a real tearjerker, make sure your hero is full of virtue.</li><li>The word virtue comes from the Latin root vir, for man. At first virtue meant manliness or valor, but over time it settled into the sense of moral excellence. Virtue can also mean excellence in general. One of your virtues might be your generous willingness to help out your friends. The phrase by virtue of means ""as a result of"" or ""by authority of."" You will achieve success by virtue of hard work (or by virtue of inside connections).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2041,"<ul><li>Aspect means a part or feature of something. If you are going to vote for a candidate, you should first learn about the various aspects of her political agenda.</li><li>At the heart of the word aspect is the Latin specere ""look"" (think spectacles). Later, the word became connected to the idea of what can be seen from a particular position. Whether that means you can see all of something (all aspects) or only part (one aspect) depends on where you are standing and how hard you are looking.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2042,"<ul><li>An asset is something you have that is positive. It can mean a piece of property, a piece of equipment, an ability, or even a quality.</li><li>""Her facility with math is an asset when it comes to figuring out the restaurant tab. She is an asset to the group."" A person's overall financial picture is determined by lining up everything they own in the asset column, and everything they own in the liability (or debit) column.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2043,"<ul><li>Whether you’re an international spy with a new mission or a high school student with math homework — when you get an assignment, you’d better do it! An assignment is a task that someone in  authority has asked you to do.</li><li>The word assignment is just the noun form of the common verb assign, which you use when you want to give someone a duty or a job.

4000EEW_B04_U13_2045,"<ul><li>The young part of a plant that's almost ready to flower or unfurl new leaves is called the bud. As a verb, bud also means to grow or develop.</li><li>You will see the word bud most often in reference to plants, but it is also used metaphorically to refer to something that is still maturing: a ""budding career,"" for instance, or a ""budding romance."" Scientists use bud to indicate a new formation of growth or something that splits apart to form a duplicate of itself, like a cell.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2046,"<ul><li>The word coordinate is all about getting things in order. Are your ducks in a row? Well, then you know what it means to coordinate something. And if you know exactly where to drop the bomb, then you know what the coordinates are.</li><li>Coordinate is one of those words that can mean very different things but is rarely misunderstood in context.  It’s a great way to describe the work of organizing, planning, and strategizing.  When synchronizing the needs of two distinct groups, for instance, it is necessary to coordinate priorities and schedules. And as you speed down the highway, listening to the serene voice on your GPS announce the coordinates of your destination, chances are you don’t think she’s organizing resources.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2047,"<ul><li>The word credit can have many meanings — from giving someone the recognition they deserve, to providing goods or services for payment that comes at a later date.</li><li>The meanings of credit don't end with borrowing money to pay at a later date or giving someone your approval. Colleges offer credits for each course in which their students enroll. A volunteer who raises thousands of dollars each year is a credit — or source of pride — to his charitable organization. Add an -s to the end of the word, and you have the scroll of names at the end of a movie.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2048,"<ul><li>When you disprove something, you argue against it or give evidence that it's not true. A student falsely accused of cheating on a test will work hard to disprove it.</li><li>Even though it took years to be acknowledged, Galileo's theory that the planets revolve around the sun managed eventually to disprove previous ideas that the Earth was at the center of the universe. If your friends think your family is ridiculously wealthy, you can disprove this idea by showing them the tiny house you live in and the beat up old car your dad drives. The Old French source of disprove is desprover, ""refute or contradict.""</li></ul>"

A humanitarian is a person concerned with the welfare of all humankind.</li><li>A millionaire would be considered a great humanitarian if he donated much of his wealth for improving education, housing, and food for the poor. As an adjective, humanitarian is used to describe something or someone who displays the characteristics of someone concerned with human welfare: ""The humanitarian project was developed to help women become self-sufficient in third world countries.""</li></ul>"

Outside science, a theory or guess can also be called a hypothesis.</li><li>A hypothesis is something more than a wild guess but less than a well-established theory. In science, a hypothesis needs to go through a lot of testing before it gets labeled a theory. In the non-scientific world, the word is used a lot more loosely. A detective might have a hypothesis about a crime, and a mother might have a hypothesis about who spilled juice on the rug. Anyone who uses the word hypothesis is making a guess.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2051,"<ul><li>Use the adjective informative to describe something that gives you some kind of useful information, like an informative book about identifying the mushrooms you find growing wild in the woods near your house.</li><li>When something is informative, it's usually educational and full of facts — like an informative text book or an informative tour of the Hindu temples of northern India. If you learn a lot from something, you can call it informative. The Latin root of informative is the word informare, which means ""to shape, train, instruct, or educate."" Something that does those things for you is informative.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2052,"<ul><li>If you describe something as optic, it has something to do with eyes or vision. Your optic nerve, for example, sends information to your brain from your eyes.</li><li>You'll most often find the adjective optic in anatomy or biology textbooks, describing the parts of an eye, or disorders involving the eye. Your optic disc is a tiny blind spot that all humans have on their eyeballs, and optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. When it's a noun, optic is an old-fashioned, jokey way to say ""eyeball."" Optic comes from the Greek optikos, ""of or having to do with sight.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2053,"<ul><li>A premise is what forms the basis of a theory or a plot. When you called 911 on the guy in your back yard, it was on the premise that he was a thief and not the meter-reader.</li><li>In logic, the premise is the basic statement upon whose truth an argument is based. Criticize alternative theories by demonstrating their false premises.  In a more general sense, it's a basic assertion. On the premise that people are generally good, you keep your doors unlocked. Premise is also used more loosely for the starting point for a plot. A movie's premise could be that two people trapped on a desert island will inevitably fall in love.</li></ul>"

A coat rack has hooks for hanging coats, and a magazine rack has shelves or slots to hold magazines.</li><li>In a store, racks hold and display items for sale (like clothes racks and book racks), while in your house you have racks for storing things (a spice rack), or drying them (in the case of a towel rack). If you rack, or wrack, your brain, it means you think extra hard;and when something goes ""to rack and ruin,"" it becomes old and decrepit, or falls apart.</li></ul>"

""Renaissance art"" describes the style of art that came out of this period.</li><li>When you see the word Renaissance spelled with a capital R, you can be sure it's referring to the European cultural movement, or the art, literature, and architecture it inspired. The Renaissance began in Italy, largely as a growth of interest in classical art and ideas. The word itself comes from the French phrase renaissance des lettres, used by the 19th-century historian Jules Michelet. In Old French renaissance means ""rebirth.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2056,"<ul><li>Spatial describes how objects fit together in space, either among the planets or down here on earth. There's a spatial relationship between Mars and Venus, as well as between the rose bushes in the backyard.</li><li>Spatial has to do with the distance between things, so mathematicians and computer scientists love using the word. ""They measured the spatial relations of ping-pong balls in the gravity-free room."" It can also refer to how people perceive the objects in front of them. If you're not wearing your glasses, your spatial perception might be off.  If you're a space cadet, you might wander off into space. Not surprisingly, spatial is from the Latin word spatium for ""space.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2057,"<ul><li>To explicitly name something or state a particular detail, you specify that thing. So, when you have a craving for dessert and you send someone to the store to buy ice cream, you may want to specify a flavor.</li><li>If you assign something for a particular purpose, this verb means that you specify. Your parents can specify for safety's sake that you can only ride your bicycle on the sidewalk and not on the street. Another use of the verb specify is to give a set of requirements. If you have your grandmother's old recipe for snickerdoodle cookies, you may wonder what the recipe means when it specifies that you should add ""a smidgen of molasses.""</li></ul>"

Some games, like chess, can actually end in a tie, but other games, like basketball, continue until there's a winner. You can also use the word tie as a verb: ""Looks like the game will tie at two apiece.""

If you want to undertake a verbal challenge right now, try saying “sushi chef” ten times quickly without messing up.</li><li>Way back in the 13th century, undertake meant “seize” or “entrap.” Of course, the meaning has shifted significantly since then, and we hope you don’t feel entrapped when you decide to undertake a project. However, undertake does convey a level of commitment and involvement that’s somewhat stronger than the words try or attempt might suggest.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U13_2060,"<ul><li>The verb wax is most often found in the company of its opposite, ""wane."" To wax is to grow larger or increase, whereas wane means to grow smaller or decrease.</li><li>As the moon grows towards fullness, it waxes. It wanes, or diminishes in size, as the new moon approaches. This is the most common context for the verb wax, but it is also used to describe other phenomena that grow or increase, particularly those that are cyclical. Figuratively, if you wax eloquent, lyrical or poetic about something, you talk about it at great length and with growing enthusiasm. The noun wax refers to chemical compounds that can be shaped and molded, for example into candles, when warm.</li></ul>"

A brainstorm can be an ""Aha!"" moment, while brainstorming is the process of trying to think of ideas.</li><li>If you've ever needed to find a topic for a paper and have just started listing every idea coming to you, you know what it's like to brainstorm. People brainstorm when they need a new idea. You can also say you had a brainstorm when a good idea or solution occurs to you.

Like allotting certain amounts for food, rent, movies, and manicures every month to make sure you don't run out of cash.</li><li>From the Middle French bougette, the noun budget translated to “leather pouch” when it was first used in the early 15th century. Perhaps a leather pouch to hold gold coins? It wasn’t until 1733 that the word took on the more specific financial meaning it has nowadays. You can budget all sorts of things, including time, money, and energy. Every year, Congress tries to balance the federal budget — but that's no easy task.</li></ul>"

Chaotic starts with a hard ""K"" sound (kay-AH-tick), but things that are chaotic are usually not OK, they're crazy disordered, like your crammed locker at the end of the school year.</li><li>Chaotic is an adjective that comes from the noun ""chaos,"" meaning complete and total confusion or lack of order. Your teacher might find it chaotic inside the bus on the way home from a field trip, with so much talking and singing and stored up energy bouncing around. A classic example of something chaotic is the running of the bulls in Spain, an event that lets people run the streets with a bunch of huge, sharp-horned bulls. It's totally chaotic!</li></ul>"

A military or other official report can cite someone for an outstanding act of service, and a legal representative can cite individuals, or summon them, to show up in court.

Your friend might ask you to meet her in the courtyard of her apartment complex.</li><li>In cities, courtyards provide small, private outdoor areas. Courtyards are often nestled between buildings, or tucked away behind them. For nearly as long as people have built houses and buildings, courtyards have existed — although in the past, they were used for keeping animals, cooking over an open fire, and sometimes even sleeping. The word dates from the 1550s, combining court, from the Latin cohors, ""enclosed yard,"" and yard, from a Germanic root also meaning ""enclosure.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U14_2070,"<ul><li>The word estate is mostly used to mean a massive and fabulous house on a big piece of land. When you own an estate, it usually means you have a whole lot of money to go along with it.</li><li>While an estate refers mostly to land and a house on it, it can also refer to all of a person’s possessions — and this sense of the word is often used after someone has died to refer to everything they are leaving behind. “You are set to inherit half of your grandfather’s estate, which includes his entire collection of stuffed raccoons.” In the past (and sometimes still) estate was also used to refer to someone’s state or condition, as well as his or her social standing.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U14_2073,"<ul><li>Integrity is a personal quality of fairness that we all aspire to — unless you're a dishonest, immoral scoundrel, of course.</li><li>Having integrity means doing the right thing in a reliable way. It's a personality trait that we admire, since it means a person has a moral compass that doesn't waver. It literally means having ""wholeness"" of character, just as an integer is a ""whole number"" with no fractions.

The prefix pre-, means “before” and historic relates to something from a past culture. Put the two together, and you get prehistoric, a word that describes something that comes from a time before history was recorded. For example, Stonehenge is a prehistoric site, or the woolly mammoth is a prehistoric beast.</li></ul>"

The prefix pro- also carries the meaning of “forward,” “ahead,” or “before.” All of these senses are at work in proponent: someone who suggests (puts forward) an idea or who is in favor of an idea. A proponent proposes an idea or advocates for a proposal or a proposition.</li></ul>"

More than just working out the kinks, refining something means you're going to fine tune it, hone it to perfection, and make it more precise.

If you're coughing up green stuff, the doctor might give you an antibiotic to fight the infection.</li><li>Since the prefix anti- means fighting, opposing, or killing, and bios is the Greek word for ""life,"" antibiotic literally means life-killing. But doctors prescribe them primarily to kill the bacteria responsible for infections in the body. (A virus, on the other hand, cannot be treated with an antibiotic, so doctors are always making a distinction between a virus and a bacterial infection.) You can also use antibiotic as an adjective. Some plants have natural antibiotic effects when eaten.</li></ul>"

Something that complements completes or adds a little something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U15_2085,"<ul><li>The noun compress refers to a pad that's held to your body to reduce pain or symptoms of illness. A washcloth dipped in cold water and pressed onto your forehead to help you cool down is a type of compress.</li><li>As a verb, compress means to squeeze together with a fair amount of pressure. When you compress a sponge to get all the water out, you press it between your palms or squish it between your fingers. Compress can also mean to make something more compact — as with the sponge, when you compress an object it gets smaller. You could even compress a speech by cutting it down into a shorter but equally effective version.</li></ul>"

Why they weren't satisfied just to ""put in"" the data, we may never know. Before that, the noun input was an economic term meaning anything that went into production: the grain was just one input among several required for the production of cereal.

You may never have seen those things before, and then suddenly they're prevalent. When something is common, it's prevalent. You could say drug use is prevalent among criminals. You could say good study habits are prevalent among good students. If a certain opinion is common, then that's a prevalent view in society.</li></ul>"

The plural form is quanta.</li><li>In the 17th century, the word quantum, from the Latin word for ""how much,"" referred to a portion. Quantum is usually a noun referring to a specific amount of something. However, it can also be used as an adjective, as in the phrase ""quantum leap,"" where it refers to a sudden, important change.

A ratio basically expresses a proportion. Often used in mathematics, the word ratio has many real world uses as well.

Viral describes a disease caused by a virus, and viruses are usually infectious.</li><li>Infections and other kinds of diseases can be classified as viral by a doctor, which means they're caused by viruses, specific kinds of microorganisms. Because of the speedy way that viral infections can spread, the meaning has grown to include the spread of ideas or information, often on the Internet. Viral videos are short online films that become incredibly popular very quickly, as people share them with each other and they spread like a virus.</li></ul>"

The citric acid in oranges and other citrus fruits gives them their tasty tang. There is a hallucinogenic street drug called acid that eats away at the user’s sense of reality.

A successful artist will hire a manager to handle the administrative aspects of his career, such as contacting galleries, setting up shows, and making sure they get paid for their work.

The first notice of cholesterol was in 1769, when a French researcher found it in gallstones. Then, in the early 19th Century the chemical was named ""cholestrine,"" from the Greek words for bile (chole) and solids (stereos), plus the chemical suffix -ol.

Often, the people and groups that form coalitions have different backgrounds but come together because they share a goal. For example, parents, teachers, business owners, and city council members might form a coalition to build a teen center, just as nations that do not agree on all issues might form a coalition because they all want peace.</li></ul>"

The word diabetes was first recorded in 1425, and in 1675, the Greek mellitus, “like honey,” was added, to reflect the sweet smell and taste of the patient’s urine.

We need to eliminate sources of pollution in order to maintain a healthy world.</li><li>The original literal meaning of eliminate was ""to thrust over the threshold and out of doors, to kick out,"" but the 18th century saw the word expand to mean ""to exclude,"" and later to ridding the body of waste. The verb then came to refer to getting rid of anything, such as a problem or foul odor. The word took an ominous turn in the 20th century, when we saw man-made pollution eliminate whole species, and war, hate, and famine nearly eliminate whole groups of people.</li></ul>"

You might call a politician who uses taxpayer money for wild parties a little ""ethics-challenged.""</li><li>Ethics can mean the study of morality — what's right and wrong. When discussing this branch of philosophy, treat the word as singular, despite the ""-s"": ""Ethics is no longer widely taught."" But in the sense of ""moral correctness"" or ""a moral code,"" treat it as plural: ""The ethics of capital punishment are complex.""

Explicit orders are easy to carry out, and explicit directions are easy to follow. When someone is explicit, they're not beating around the bush or being confusing.

Unless you make all your own clothes, a company probably had to manufacture them.</li><li>Manufacture is generally associated with industry and factories. Henry Ford, for instance, revolutionized industry by using assembly lines to manufacture Model Ts. But manufacture can also be used for the natural word, like bees that manufacture honey. Occasionally it use used more generally to mean to construct by putting parts together. And in a pinch, you can manufacture — or make — the truth, which is a creative way to say “lie.”</li></ul>"

If you’ve set up a method for dealing with your sister when she annoys you, then you have a mechanism in place for establishing peace with your sister.</li><li>The word mechanism came into the English language in the seventeenth century by way of the Latin word mechanismus, which traces back to the Greek word mekhane, meaning “device"" or ""means.” Mechanism still carries with it the meaning of “device” and can be used to describe a machine, but nowadays you are more likely to hear it used to describe a process for getting something done, such as ""a mechanism for generating revenue"" or ""a crisis-resolution mechanism.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U16_2116,"<ul><li>The verb minimize describes making something smaller or less serious. It typically refers to something negative that is being reduced, like when you eat at home instead of in restaurants to minimize expenses.</li><li>To correctly pronounce minimize, accent the first syllable, which gets the short i sound: ""MIH-nuh-mize."" Minimize looks like minimum, which has the same spelling and meaning in English and Latin: smallest. To minimize something is to reduce it to its smallest amount — in size or importance. Other related words include minimal, miniscule, minute, and mini.</li></ul>"

When the ancient Greeks visualized the gods having a party on their Olympian lawns, they saw nectar in their cups.</li><li>Nectar was originally used to describe the drinks of the gods, but regular old humans need the good stuff too. Serious wine lovers would describe their drink as nectar, while the serious raw food eater might save the term for a ginger-beet-cayenne juice. If you ask the hummingbird, she would give you a very tiny straw and direct you to the nectaries of a flower.</li></ul>"

A notion is an idea, often vague and sometimes fanciful.</li><li>A notion is lighter than a theory and embraces a whimsy that a simple idea never could. You might have the notion that you can slow global warming by taking public transportation and reusing plastic bags. If you share a far-fetched idea with others, someone might respond with a ""Where'd you get that notion?!"" Notions can also refer to the buttons, thread, zippers, and pins necessary for sewing things.

4000EEW_B04_U16_2119,"<ul><li>A regime is the ruling government of a country. The amount of freedom and restriction that citizens of a country have can change from regime to regime.</li><li>Regime takes its militaristic and government feel from the Latin word regimen ""to rule."" A political regime has a negative association to it that makes you think of totalitarian governments. How did it come to mean ""diet"" or ""program of exercise"" as well? If you are put on a regime of exercise and healthy eating, you are ordered by a doctor to do these things and it probably feels like you're being ruled sometimes!</li></ul>"

When you have a favor to ask of a friend, don't beat around the bush––say what you need in a straightforward way.</li><li>If you want to propose marriage, you might go for the straightforward approach, saying, ""Want to get married?"" over dinner.

4000EEW_B04_U17_2121,"<ul><li>You might not have any money in your pocket, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you are bankrupt. It takes a legal proceeding for the courts to declare a person bankrupt — or officially unable to pay his debts.</li><li>Despite the word bank in bankrupt, the word can be used to describe an entity that is short of something other than money. A bankrupt nation might not have the natural resources for its people to produce goods. A nearby country that could easily help but chooses not to may be considered morally bankrupt because of its lack of compassion. Or, maybe there is more to the story. That nation might fear that helping another will bankrupt its own shaky economy. (That is how bankrupt can be used as a verb.)</li></ul>"

So if you travel to Morocco, you should conform to the local custom and adjust your usual wardrobe to one that is more modest.</li><li>Sometimes conform gets a bad rap, carrying with it the sense of compromising one’s individuality to fit in or please others. But take note that it doesn’t always have to carry such a negative charge. For example, the manager of a factory that produces bouncy balls would want each ball that came off his conveyor belts to conform to a high standard of durability, bounciness, and roundness.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U17_2123,"<ul><li>To employ means to use something or hire someone to work. You can employ a saw to cut a board or employ a tutor to teach you math. You can even employ your talents in study and activities.</li><li>The Latin source of employ is the word implicāre, which literally means to enfold or be connected with. This ties in with the verb employ, which is transitive and needs a direct object. (You can't just say ""I will employ — you have to employ something.) The word also suggests using something for a specific purpose: you can employ someone for a job or find something in which to employ your own interests.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U17_2124,"<ul><li>Getting expelled from a school is a step beyond suspension. It means that you are asked to leave and never come back. In other words, you have been kicked out.</li><li>More benignly, expel can mean discharge: if you're having a water-fountain spitting-fight, you are hoping to expel water from your mouth in the direction of your opponent before they can get you. But don't do this; you won't get expelled from school, but the germs in your body will be expelled all over your friends.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U17_2125,"<ul><li>An extension is the act of getting more time, space, or length, like an extension of a deadline that gives you one more day to turn in a paper, or extensions that make your hair look longer.</li><li>The noun extension comes from the Latin word extendere, meaning “stretch out.” If you’re a great gymnast, you probably have amazing extension — flexible and long-reaching limbs. If someone meets your sister and assumes you will be exactly like her, you might say, ""That's a stretch,"" meaning this person has, by extension, drawn conclusions about you which are somewhat true but not completely accurate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U17_2126,"<ul><li>You know when you go to a movie and they show the previews under the heading ""Coming Soon?"" They could just as well say forthcoming, because it means the same thing.

You can furnish an answer to a question in an interview, furnish the snacks at a party, or furnish a room by filling it with couches and chairs.</li><li>Just as furniture fills a room or a building, to furnish is to fill a need. Another word for furnish is ""provide."" A furnace furnishes heat (try saying that ten times fast). A job furnishes you with an income. Your parents furnish you with a place to live, furniture included.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U17_2128,"<ul><li>Hygiene is any practice or activity that you do to keep things healthy and clean. Washing hands, coughing into your elbow, and regular house cleaning are all part of good hygiene.</li><li>Hygieia was the Greek goddess of health, cleanliness and sanitation, so it's not hard to see where the word hygiene comes from. Good oral hygiene includes brushing and flossing your teeth, and working in a clean kitchen helps promote food hygiene. You have a better chance of staying healthy during flu season -and any other time- if you practice good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently.</li></ul>"

Mothers are always spouting hygienic messages like ""Wash your hands!"" or ""Brush your teeth!""</li><li>Hygienic comes from the ancient Greek word hygies, meaning ""healthy"" or, literally, ""living well."" This state was represented by the Goddess Hygieia, the embodiment of health and cleanliness. Hygienic is often used indiscriminately with sanitary, though in fact sanitary implies a particular nose-wrinkling emphasis on proper sewage disposal and clean water that is only a part of the Greeks' original concept of a more comprehensive physical and mental well being.</li></ul>"

A landlord owns a house, building, or property and rents it out to other people.</li><li>Many people have landlords they call when their drains are clogged and mail their rent checks to on the first of each month. Business owners often have landlords too, who own their retail or office spaces. Men and women can both be landlords, although you can also call a female landlord a landlady.

If you lease a car from a dealer, for example, you make payments and you get to drive the car, but at the end of the contract you have to give it back.</li><li>As a noun, a lease is both the thing you are contracting to rent (the car itself is a lease) and the contract spelling out the terms of use — in other words, a rental agreement. Be sure to check the fine print on your apartment lease to avoid any unpleasant surprises when you move out — like owing money for painting over that hideous wallpaper in the living room.</li></ul>"

The phrase ""mandatory requirement"" is redundant.</li><li>A mandatory action is something that is required, obligatory, or compulsory. Like letting your Great Aunt Edna pinch your cheeks or passing gym to get your diploma. Mandatory is often used in opposition to optional. If you want to compete with the swim team at school, weeknight practices are mandatory, meaning you have to go, though the Saturday dawn swim practice remains optional, meaning it's up to you.</li></ul>"

If not you'll have to sit in the dark.</li><li>The word mend was originally used as a religious term, meaning to free a person from sin, usually through repentance and good deeds. Mend has come to refer to fixing something that is broken. A mechanic might mend a broken car, or a seamstress might mend a torn dress. The word also frequently relates health and healing. Someone recovering from a long bout of the flu is said to be ""on the mend."" But as the song goes, ""How can you mend a broken heart?""</li></ul>"

Offer your friend a mortgage for the $20 he wants...with his bike as security.</li><li>Most people obtain a mortgage when they buy a house. The bank extends the loan because of the guarantee that the house will be the bank’s to sell if the debt isn’t repaid. When you make this deal, you have mortgaged your house — the word mortgage can be used as a noun or a verb.</li></ul>"

If you have a job, you’re probably considered personnel to be managed.</li><li>The word personnel is also sometimes short for the ""personnel department,"" another name for the human resources or employment office. One of the things they might have in the personnel department is your personnel, which contains your employment records.</li></ul>"

Yikes!</li><li>You can use the noun plumbing whether you're talking about the bathroom sink, the pipes connected to your dishwasher, or the bathtub drain. A home's heating system often consists of plumbing too. The work of fixing or installing this type of system is also plumbing.

4000EEW_B04_U17_2137,"<ul><li>If a journalist is interviewing you and you blurt out something inappropriate, you will have to ask her not to quote you on that. Sometimes the word quote is used as shorthand for quotation, a passage of speech or writing that’s repeated word for word.</li><li>As a verb, to quote means to repeat someone’s words, attributing them to their originator. If you’re giving a speech on personal organization, you might want to quote Ben Franklin in it — he’s the master. When you write out a quote, you put the other person’s words in quotation marks (“Aha!”). Sometimes a price estimate is called a quote, like when a mechanic looks at your engine and gives you a quote for the cost of repair.</li></ul>"

If you blast your music and let the cat pee in the corner, your landlord will not think that you're a very good tenant.</li><li>Tenant is often used to mean ""renter,"" but it can mean anyone who has the right to live in a particular place, either because he signed a lease, which is a rental agreement, because he owns the land, or because government gave him a title to it. If you live in a big apartment building, you should be aware of your rights as a tenant, which usually include things like having heat in the winter and proper fire escapes.</li></ul>"

At first the food scalds your tongue, but over time you adapt — you change in a way that allows you to deal with the new circumstances.</li><li>Adapt comes from the ancient word ap, which means ""take"" or ""grasp."" Ap is even older than Latin — it comes from a lost language that was spoken by the common ancestors of modern-day Indians and Europeans and has since been reconstructed by linguists, who named it the Proto-Indo-European language, or PIE.  So what does adapt have to do with grasp?  If you adapt to, say, a new country, it's as though you're grabbing hold of its strange, slippery customs.</li></ul>"

You'll recognize the root ""bio-,"" meaning ""life,"" as in biography — the story of someone's life — and biology — the study of living organisms.</li><li>The woman who gave birth to you is your biological mother — she's passed her genes on to you and you're related to her, even if somebody else raised you. Anybody you share genes with is your biological relative. Biological cleaning products make use of natural enzymes, and they're supposed to be safe and non-toxic.

Someone with a dynamic personality is probably funny, loud, and excitable; a quiet, mousy person isn't dynamic.

In literature, fantasy — a genre similar to science fiction — might include a story about a three-headed squirrel and a bionic aardvark who fall in love on a planet made entirely of strawberries. Romance can be fantasy, too, according to a Billy Joel song: ""It's just a fantasy. It's not the real thing. But sometimes a fantasy is all you need.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2146,"<ul><li>Heredity is the biological process responsible for passing on physical traits from one generation to another. If your mom and dad both have dreamy blue eyes and so do you, then you've got hereditary to thank for your movie-star gaze.</li><li>First used in the 1530s, the noun heredity comes from the Latin word hereditatem, meaning ""condition of being an heir."" It can refer to inheriting characteristics from your parents, or it can refer more broadly to the passing on of genetic factors from one generation to the next. Heredity will determine a person's hair color and height. And due to heredity, some people are more susceptible to diseases and disorders like cancer, alcoholism, and depression.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2147,"<ul><li>The adjective internal describes something on the inside. If you're tempted by a second piece of cake, you may have an internal battle with yourself over whether you should eat the cake or not.</li><li>Internal can also describe something that takes place within a country or a group. You pay your taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, and politicians argue about how to spend your tax dollars when they discuss the country's internal affairs. You may have to write internal reports for your boss––reports that aren't supposed to be seen outside the company.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2148,"<ul><li>Minimal means the smallest possible, or the least — as in, ""She passed the test with minimal studying."" Minimal can also mean simple, as in ""The apartment had a minimal decor scheme: white walls, no art, a simple black couch.""</li><li>When there is ""minimal supervision"" at a slumber party, few grownups are present. When you spend the ""minimal amount of money"" on a trip, you won't be staying at the Ritz. If you grew up with minimal contact with one of your parents, you barely saw or spoke to them. If you like to keep things simple, you might call yourself a minimalist, or a believer in minimalism.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2149,"<ul><li>A pioneer is one of the first settlers in a new place. If you desperately want to experience life in space, maybe you will be one of the pioneers who live in the first moon settlement.</li><li>Pioneer comes from the old French for foot soldier or laborer, and particularly for groups of soldiers that would go out ahead of the rest of the troops to prepare the way. The European settlers who came to America in the 16th century are known as pioneers, as are the later groups who traveled West in the 18th and 19th centuries. We also use pioneer for anyone who takes initiative in a field, such as science or education.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2150,"<ul><li>To prescribe is make orders or give directions for something to be done. These days, the word is mainly used by doctors who prescribe medications to take.</li><li>Doctors do a lot of prescribing: they prescribe drugs, rest, exercise, and getting rid of bad habits like smoking. When a doctor prescribes something, he or she is saying, ""You need to do this. You should do it."" That's the most common use of prescribe, but it pops up anywhere someone is advising or ordering someone to do something. All laws and rules prescribe things — they tell you what to do.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2151,"<ul><li>When two people each have something of their own, it's their respective thing. In a boxing match, the opponents each start in their respective or individual corners.</li><li>Respective comes from the Latin respectivus meaning ""having regard for."" Everyone has regard for what's respectively theirs.  We have respective opinions, respective responsibilities, respective anxieties. It's basically another word for individual. Each of a set of twins probably has his respective bed, even though they might share a bedroom together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2152,"<ul><li>Describe something as rigid if it's really stiff and not very flexible, like a super-strict practice schedule or an unbending, uncomfortable mattress.</li><li>The adjective rigid is actually related to the Latin word frigus, which means “cold.” So think of a rigid icicle or a rock-hard igloo to help you remember what rigid means. You can also use it to describe something that's particularly strict or unable to change, like the stubborn views of a person who just won't consider another perspective.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2153,"<ul><li>When things come in sequence, they come in a specific order. It could be a chronological sequence, a sequence following a pattern (red-blue-brown, red-blue-brown), or a cause-and-effect sequence.</li><li>Sequence can also be a verb. When you sequence something, you put it in order. The prom committee had the task of sequencing dance music––even if playing ""Celebrate"" as the final dance and not the first felt out of sequence to the DJ, it was their call.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2154,"<ul><li>Similar things are alike.  If you and your best friend both like walking, mystery novels, and chocolate, and you both dislike jogging, science fiction, and Brussels sprouts, the two of you have similar tastes.</li><li>The Latin root for similar is similis, meaning ""like.""  If two movies have similar plots, you might like one better because it has a better script or more interesting actors.  If you're tired of being told how similar you are to your long-haired, friendly mother, you could cut your hair.  Or start being rude.  Remember that similar ends in ""lar"" even though it might not sound like it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2155,"<ul><li>Something or someone that takes the place of another is said to be a substitute. You may be sent into a game as a substitute for an injured player, or you might substitute chocolate chips for blueberries in a pancake recipe.</li><li>Substitute can be used as an adjective to describe something or someone that takes the place of another. Teenagers are notoriously hard on substitute teachers, sometimes giving them fake names or wrong information about classroom work. Substitute can also be used as a verb. So if you are asked to substitute for a teacher, you probably shouldn't believe everything the students tell you!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2156,"<ul><li>A surgeon is a kind of doctor who treats his patients by using his hands, often by performing surgery. If you're comfortable slicing into a person's body to remove an appendix, then you might make a decent surgeon.</li><li>The word surgeon comes from the Greek kheirourgos, which is a fancy way of saying ""done by the hand."" Whereas a doctor-at-large might treat his patients by chatting with them, asking questions, and prescribing medications, a surgeon's work is much more hands-on, you might say. A surgeon specializes in cutting open the body, usually to heal his patients.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2157,"<ul><li>Therapy is the act of caring for someone, or the method of caring. If you have a rare disease, your doctor's therapy will hopefully cure you.</li><li>Therapy comes from the Greek θεραπεία, for ""healing."" If someone tells you she's ""in therapy,"" she's probably talking about a psychological kind of healing. But if she's getting physical therapy, then she's getting help with a bone or muscle problem. If someone suggests an experimental therapy, that's a mode of treatment that's new. Sometimes if something non-medical makes you feel better, we call it a kind of therapy. You might like chocolate therapy, for example.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2158,"<ul><li>If you are moving something from one place to another, like transferring money from your savings account to your checking account, you are transferring it. Or, if you've been moved from one job site to another — you, my friend, have been transferred.</li><li>Transfer can also be a noun that means the act of moving something from one form or location to another, so that money that was shifted from one account to another is considered a transfer. If you change something from one form to another, you can say that you transferred it. ""Her mother had transferred all the old 8mm home movies to video tape. Now she'd have to transfer them again using a more modern technology.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2159,"<ul><li>A transition is a change from one thing to the next, either in action or state of being—as in a job transition or as in the much more dramatic example of a caterpillar making a transition into a butterfly.</li><li>Transition is awfully reassuring in its tidy reliance on regular forms. Trans means ""cross,"" so when you hear it at the beginning of a word you know that it indicates crossing, as in transatlantic or  translate. An odd thing happening with transition lately is that it is transitioning from its familiar form as a noun to a newer life as a verb, as in “We’re going to transition Gloria to that new job.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U18_2160,"<ul><li>Use the verb transplant to describe what you do when you move a cactus into a bigger container, or what a doctor does when she places a donor organ — like a kidney or lung — into the body of a patient.</li><li>When you transplant your favorite rose bush, you carefully dig it up and re-plant it in another spot in the yard, maybe one that gets more sunlight. You can also use the word as a noun to describe the act of doing such a thing: ""The liver transplant was a success."" The word's origin is simple: the Latin trans, or ""across,"" plus plantare, which means ""to plant.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2161,"<ul><li>If you don't leave your house without checking your horoscope, and you’re always asking people, “What’s your sign?” you’re likely a fan of astrology — the idea that the stars and planets and their movements influence human life.</li><li>Astrology comes from the Greek astron ""star"" and the suffix -ology ""study of."" The actual science of the celestial bodies is astronomy, which also includes the Greek word for ""star"" but with a suffix that means ""arranging."" Astrology has been around since ancient times, and while it requires some knowledge of astronomy, it’s about as scientific as fortune telling and palm reading.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2162,"<ul><li>If you are hanging out with a couple of friends, you are hanging out with two friends. A couple is a pair or a twosome. As a verb, couple means ""to pair or match.""</li><li>As a noun, couple means ""a pair."" If two people are dating, you can refer to them as ""a couple."" Similarly, two people who are married can be called a ""married couple."" Two guys playing basketball can be called ""a couple of guys playing basketball."" As a verb, couple means ""to pair or combine,"" as people on a dance floor might couple or form pairs when the music starts. You can also couple two ideas by combining them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2163,"<ul><li>If something turns off course or is diverted, it deviates from the expected or the norm. Deviating from explicit recipe directions is never a good idea, unless you want inedible food or a kitchen fire.</li><li>The verb deviate can refer to divergence from a predicted path or road (""the airplane's route deviated from the flight plan""), but it can also refer to a divergence from normal behavior or expectations. When women demanded the right to vote, their behavior was considered shocking and deviated from the expectations of the time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2164,"<ul><li>To differentiate is to identify the differences between things, to discriminate among them.  For example, if the light is dim at the party, you might find it hard to differentiate between the spicy bean dip and the chocolate sauce.</li><li>You can see different in differentiate. This will help you remember that it has to do with finding how things are different, or making them different. For example, identical twins look alike but if you get to know them, personality traits, speech patterns and their likes and dislikes help differentiate one from another. Also, when you wear a team uniform the number on your back helps coaches differentiate between teammates when everyone is playing fast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2165,"<ul><li>To disrupt is to interrupt or throw something into disorder. If you don't turn your phone off before a play, it might ring and disrupt the actors and the audience.</li><li>Disrupt goes back to the Latin root disrumpere, ""to break apart."" When you disrupt, you break someone's concentration, break up a routine, or break apart a system or order, as when bad weather disrupts the travel plans of people in airports. Even if your headphones keep the music in your ears only, singing out loud can disrupt those around you. A larger interruption would be if a war were to erupt. That would disrupt the peace of an entire region and its people.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2166,"<ul><li>In an equation, the quantities on both sides of the equal sign are equal. That's the mathematical meaning of equation, but equation can also be used in any number of situations, challenges, or efforts to solve a problem.</li><li>The ""equa"" at the beginning of equation will be familiar from other words such as ""equal,"" ""equality,"" and ""equate.""  All of these words have to do with making things balance out. 

An equation is a statement of the equality of two quantities. If that equation is not a mathematical one but rather, say, an interpersonal one, it's still a situation in which you might try to make the two sides equal. For example, taking marriage out of the equation might make it easier for two people to decide to stay together for a while.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2167,"<ul><li>When you err, you make a mistake or do something wrong. When a newspaper reporter errs in a printed story, the paper often prints a correction the next day.</li><li>By itself, err, which shares a Latin root with error, is a formal way to say ""mess up."" The proverb ""To err is human, to forgive divine"" is an old-fashioned version of ""Hey, everyone makes mistakes. Why don't you be the bigger person and let it go?"" Err can also mean to go in a certain direction, as in another common saying, ""Err on the side of caution,"" or ""Play it safe.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2168,"<ul><li>The adjective erroneous describes something or someone as mistaken and incorrect. Early explorers had the erroneous notion that the oceans were full of dragons.</li><li>When we talk about being on the ""straight and narrow path"" we aim to live a truthful and moral life. The Latin root of erroneous, or ""to be incorrect"" as well as ""to be immoral,"" is errare, which means ""to wander."" It's clear that we make connections between behavior and direction or space. These two ideas have been linked for a very long time!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2169,"<ul><li>When a mother loses her child, she's frantic. She's a crazed sort of agitated and goes on a frantic search for her child. A scene is frantic if there's lots of action with little order.</li><li>Frantic is related to frenzy and both were originally ways to describe mental illness. Hundreds of years ago, if you were frantic, you were stark raving mad. Today, frantic implies fast wild movements or a desperate attempt to do something. On Christmas Eve, the scene at the mall was frantic with shoppers desperately searching for their last few gifts. And a wild party would only be called frantic if the police were called and everyone rushed to get away.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2170,"<ul><li>When something happens by accident, it's inadvertent, or unintentional.  The gas company assured you that the error in your bill  was inadvertent and that they would fix it, but not before you blew off some steam.</li><li>If you break down the adjective inadvertent you find the word vert, from the Latin vertere, meaning ""to turn.""  Advertent comes to mean ""turning the mind to,"" and as the prefix in- means ""not,"" inadvertent means “not turning the mind to,” or ""not intending to."" When your actions are inadvertent you're not paying attention to their consequences.  Remember that inadvertent ends with -ent by remembering this sentence: “We inadvertently ripped the tent.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2171,"<ul><li>To improvise means to make something up on the spot, or figure it out as you go. ""Our boss decided to improvise his speech at our company meeting and when he started going off-topic, everyone could tell he hadn't prepared in advance.""</li><li>Improvise comes from the Latin word improvisus, meaning ""unforeseen, unexpected."" Think about when something unexpected happens to you — you have no choice but to react in the moment, or improvise. Another meaning for improvise refers to acting onstage without a script. When actors improvise scenes for an audience, they create funny situations as they go, without having anything pre-planned. The Second City theater in Chicago made this type of comedy famous, with many well-known alumni like Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2172,"<ul><li>Use the word latitude to describe how much freedom you have in making choices. For example, if a teacher gives you latitude in writing your paper, you might get to choose the topic and how many sources to include.</li><li>Latitude is related to the Latin word latitudo, meaning ""breadth, width, extent, size."" You might already know that latitude is used to indicate the distance an object is from the equator, measured from north to south. Latitude can also be used to mean ""be given the space to act and decide for oneself,"" like the latitude parents might give responsible kids.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2173,"<ul><li>A mariner is someone who works on a boat or ship. A lobsterman who works alone on a small boat is a mariner, and so is the captain of an enormous cargo ship.</li><li>Mariner is a somewhat old-fashioned word for a sailor or seafarer, a person who spends most of their working life on some kind of ocean vessel. Today, you're more likely to read about mariners in an old book than to meet people who describes themselves this way. Mariner comes from the Latin word marinus, ""of the sea,"" and its root, mare, ""the sea.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2174,"<ul><li>A multitude is a very large number or a huge crowd. If you see a  multitude of zombies approaching, you're in trouble.</li><li>Sometimes the word multitude refers to the common people, or the masses — that is, everyone in a society apart from the political elite.  There are a lot of words and phrases for this, like hoi polloi, which is Greek for ""the many,"" and ""the great unwashed.""  Those last two terms are usually used in a disapproving way, but multitudes is generally a positive term. If you were to say that a leader inspired the multitudes to rise up against their oppressor, we'd assume that you sympathized with the multitudes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2175,"<ul><li>Whether it’s a mosquito or your little brother pestering you about the laundry, you can use the word nuisance to describe something that causes small annoyances.</li><li>The noun nuisance traces back to the Latin word nocere, meaning “to harm.” Nuisance originally was used to refer to things that could produce serious injury and harm, but over time the word lost some of its capacity for destruction. Nowadays you’ll hear nuisance used to describe things or people that cause small problems or that bother you in annoying but trivial ways.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2176,"<ul><li>Permanence is when something sticks around forever, like your mother's love or the smell of smoke after you accidentally start a fire in your kitchen.</li><li>Something can give the impression of permanence, even if it isn't literally infinite, like a massive stone castle or a pesky neighbor who always seems to be hanging around. The noun permanence comes from permanent, which in Latin means ""remaining to the end,"" from the roots per, ""through,"" and manere, ""remain or stay.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2177,"<ul><li>When something revolves, it turns on an axis or in an orbit around something else. People who love you probably think the world revolves around you (but really, the earth revolves around the sun).</li><li>Revolve comes from those useful Latin roots re- ""again"" or ""back"" and volvere ""roll,"" as seen in evolution, involve, and lots of other familiar words. Picture a revolving door, and you can understand what it means to revolve, or turn in a circular motion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2178,"<ul><li>To soothe is to relieve or to bring comfort. If the pounding in your head is driving you mad, it sounds like you might need an aspirin or two to soothe your headache.</li><li>Soothing is meant to make you feel better, both physically and emotionally. Spend too many hours on the beach without sunblock? You'll need some aloe to soothe that sunburn. Had a bad breakup with a boyfriend? Soothing that broken heart might take something stronger — chocolates, a gabfest with good friends, and sappy movies are usually just what the doctor ordered.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2179,"<ul><li>If you’re stuck somewhere with no way of getting anywhere else, you’re stranded. If you run out of gas while driving in the desert, you'll be stranded until someone finds you. Good luck!</li><li>If you’re stranded, you probably experienced some kind of transportation failure. You might see stranded travelers at an airport in the middle of a blizzard. Boats can be stranded if their engines break down. Anything left behind or stuck can be called stranded, like a stranded fish in a tidal pool, or a stranded child at a fair. Stranded involves being left somewhere unpleasant, remote, or inconvenient — if you’re stuck at an amazing restaurant you're really not stranded.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U19_2180,"<ul><li>A technique is a method of doing some task or performing something. Your technique for opening drinks might be to twist the top off with your teeth. If so, your dentist better have a good tooth-repair technique.</li><li>The noun technique can also refer to someone's skillfulness with the fundamentals of a particular task. A violinist could have excellent technique, but lack passion, for example. Writers usually have very individual writing techniques: One might need to write late at night and another early in the morning; some have to write by hand on paper, while others always use the computer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2181,"<ul><li>Something absurd is really silly, absolutely ridiculous, or total nonsense. Thinking you can wear flip flops and a bikini to the North Pole is an absurd idea, for example.</li><li>If you run into someone dressed in an absurd outfit or watch a movie full of absurd jokes, you'll probably have a good laugh. But find yourself dealing with the absurd; you'll likely be stuck in a depressing existential crisis. The absurd describes a state of being where human life has no purpose and everything is completely irrational.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2182,"<ul><li>A person who's ""born to rule"" belongs to the ruling class, or aristocracy, and is ""noble"" just by being in the family line — whether they have done anything noble or not. In an aristocracy, a princess who doesn’t visit sick children or clear land mines is still a princess.</li><li>""Rule of the best"" or ""by a privileged class"" are 16th-century Latin meanings for aristocracy. There are examples of the ""best"" coming from ordinary society, no matter who their parents are, but often the aristocracy is made up of families who start ruling and keep the power in the family generation after generation. Kings and queens, princes and princesses, and dukes and earls, are all titles within an aristocracy, though some really hard-working and noble outsiders may earn a spot in the aristocracy too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2183,"<ul><li>An aristocrat is someone from the ruling class, usually those with nobility, money, or both. Although not an aristocrat yourself, you may have the odd viscount on your family tree if you go back far enough.</li><li>The word aristocrat comes from the Greek word aristokratia, which itself comes from the root words aristos, meaning ""best,"" and kratos, meaning ""rule."" So, the aristocracy was the ruling class of (supposedly) the best and noblest people, and an aristocrat was a member of that class. Today the word can also be applied to anyone with superior standing: Count Basie was an aristocrat in the jazz world.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2184,"<ul><li>The noun attire is just a formal way to say ""outfit."" And if you’re going outside in the middle of a blizzard, your attire should include more than a bathing suit and flip-flops.</li><li>Attire can also refer to the antlers of a deer, but that’s a pretty obscure definition. So let's stick to the more common uses: put it into verb form and it means ""to dress or clothe."" Which makes sense, since it comes to us from the Old French atirier, meaning “to equip, ready or prepare.” Charles Dickens wrote that “Great men are seldom over-scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire"" —  meaning the clothes do not make the man.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2185,
4000EEW_B04_U20_2186,"<ul><li>To denote is to draw attention to something or to show what it means. All of the googly-eyed looks that a girl gives to a boy might do more to denote her feelings for him than leaving a note in his locker.</li><li>Denote comes from the Latin root dēnotāre, ""to mark out."" Using a particular facial expression can denote meaning, as in, ""All of the crinkled foreheads and squinted eyebrows denoted a lack of understanding among the math students."" Words and symbols also point to, or denote, meaning, ""If he had used PST to denote the fact that he was in the Pacific time zone, she would have known that it was only 4:00 a.m. and too early to call from New York.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2187,"<ul><li>When you enlarge something, you make it bigger. If you build a huge addition on the side of your house, you enlarge it.</li><li>You can enlarge a sand castle by dumping another bucket of sand on it, or enlarge your hairdo by curling and teasing it. When a photographer enlarges a photograph, she blows it up, or prints a much larger copy of it, and you can also enlarge an idea, or someone's understanding of it, by clarifying or explaining it. The Old French root of enlarge is enlargier, ""to widen, increase, or make larger.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2188,"<ul><li>Excess is too much of something, like big-time overindulgence. Eating to excess makes your stomach hurt, and spending to excess means you can't pay your credit card bills.</li><li>Excess comes from the Latin word excessus meaning, ""go out, going beyond the bounds of reason,"" like eating and spending in excess. (Not so reasonable.) Although it spends most of its time as a noun, it can also be an adjective to describe ""more than is required or needed,"" like when excess water spills over the top of the bathtub, or those excess pounds spill over the top of your jeans.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2189,"<ul><li>Feminine is the opposite of masculine. If it has anything to do with girls and women, it's considered feminine.</li><li>Anything feminine is associated with females. In American culture, that includes wearing pink, playing with dolls, sporting high heels, and getting weepy during sad movies. Many women find the traditional feminine roles to be sexist and limiting, while many men pick on each other for acting in a stereotypical feminine manner. But ideas about what is feminine are always changing: pants used to only be a masculine thing to wear, for example.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2190,"<ul><li>Hierarchy describes a system that organizes or ranks things, often according to power or importance. At school the principal is at the top of the staff hierarchy, while the seniors rule the student hierarchy.</li><li>Also known as a pecking order or power structure, a hierarchy is a formalized or simply implied understanding of who's on top or what's most important. All that sorting and ranking can be helpful if you're a business administrator, but if you find yourself arranging all the produce in your fridge according to a hierarchy of color, size, and expiration date, you might want to consider visiting a therapist.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2191,"<ul><li>A pad is a soft cushion or mat that protects or supports something. Football players wear pads to keep their bodies from being injured, and you may sit on a pad to cushion your bottom.</li><li>A thick cotton bandage is one kind of pad, and your mattress might be topped by another kind of pad. There's also the soft, cushion-like pad on the bottom of an animal's paws as well as the fleshy part of your own fingertips. There are numerous other pads, including ink pads and helicopter landing pads, and — informally — your cool apartment, or pad. When you pad something, you stuff it, cushion it, or fill it out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2192,"<ul><li>If you open a lemonade stand with your brother, then your brother is your business partner.</li><li>Partner means ""to pair up."" At a square dance, the call ""partner up!"" means it's time to find someone to dance with. In business, there are often multiple partners — each one owns a share of the business, and has a share of the risk. Some people call their spouse or the person they're in a long-term relationship with their partner — it has more egalitarian senses than ""husband"" or ""wife,"" and signals commitment even if you're not married.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2193,"<ul><li>If you’re talking about the most popular or common thing, call it predominant. If the predominant feeling in a neighborhood is that pizza is the best food, the result might be pizzerias being the predominant type of restaurant there.</li><li>The adjective predominant describes a person or thing with great power or influence, or something that is prevalent. It comes from the Latin prefix prae-, “before,” and dominari, “to rule.” For example, because so many people like hip-hop, it might be the predominant music heard at a school dance. And that neighborhood with all the pizzerias? Teenagers are the predominant customers, and pepperoni is the predominant topping.</li></ul>"

It is derived from the French and refers to the correct rules of etiquette for diplomats.</li><li>The term protocol is used in many areas besides diplomatic ones. School marching bands or college admissions offices follow protocols, and doctors use them to treat patients with specific conditions. In tech circles, a protocol is a set of standards that programmers follow so that their work can be decoded by other computers. The p in the http of a web address is short for protocol.

Then you should probably find a more reputable source than the tabloids — meaning someone with a better reputation, in this case for telling the truth.</li><li>That's the thing with reputable reputations. People know you can be trusted, that you're honest and not trying to pull one over on anybody. Reputable institutions usually have a history of excellent service or outstanding work, and always come highly recommended. Reputable used car salesmen may seem scarce. The word reputable actually has a good deal of reputability itself, since it's been in standard use since the 17th century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2196,"<ul><li>To signify means to ""mean."" When Paul Revere looked for the lanterns in the church tower, he knew that one would signify that the British were coming by land and two would indicate that they were coming by sea.</li><li>When objects are endowed with symbolic meaning, they are said to signify things. A dove signifies peace, a six-pointed star signifies Judaism, a frog signifies fertility, a trident signifies the Hindu Shiva or the Greek Poseidon.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2197,"<ul><li>A strip of material used to hold something in place is a strap, like your bathing suit's shoulder straps, the strap on your book bag, or the strap of your seatbelt.</li><li>As a verb, strap means ""to secure with straps"": ""Let me strap my backpack on before I climb on your motorcycle."" Standing passengers on buses and subways are sometimes called straphangers, named for the habit of grabbing the leather or webbed straps that once commonly hung from above. Some modes of transportation still have these straps, though they've increasingly been replaced with poles and handles.</li></ul>"

The designer who launches a line of cardboard bathing suits is expressing his style, even if no one else finds these soggy suits stylish, or in fashion, at the moment. When hyphenated, style can describe the qualities of a person or thing, as in ""Cajun-style cooking.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2199,"<ul><li>A tangle is a jumble. You might have a tangle of cords behind your computer or a tangle of complications related to your taxes. Whatever it is, once something is in a tangle, it's difficult to sort out.</li><li>The word tangle likely originated from a Scandinavian source — taggla, in a Swedish dialect, means “disarrange.” Tangle also can be used as a verb: you may tangle your hair as a fashion statement, but then it hurts to comb it out. As a noun, tangle can refer to an argument or a fight between two people: if you're really feisty, people might be warned away from getting into a tangle with you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U20_2200,"<ul><li>Vanity is the quality of being vain, or having a ridiculous amount of pride. If you have excessive vanity in your appearance, you probably spend long hours sitting at your vanity table doing your makeup or plucking your nose hairs.</li><li>If you pride yourself on looking absolutely perfect and refuse to do any work that might dirty your clothes or mess up your hair, someone might accuse you of vanity. Often vanity is empty, like the emperor’s in The Emperor's New Clothes. If someone pays to have her own book published even though it’s really bad, we say it is a vanity printing.</li></ul>"

When you've tired of canoeing, you can paddle back to the edge of the lake and go ashore.</li><li>An old rowboat might wash ashore, drifting up on the beach, or you might bring your kayak ashore after paddling from one island to another. You can also talk about being ashore after spending time on a boat or ship: ""I'm ashore until Friday, and then I head back out on the cruise ship."" The roots are a-, ""to"" or ""toward,"" and shore, from the Middle Low German schōre, ""shore, coast, or headland.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2202,"<ul><li>""Contra-"" usually means ""against,"" and to contradict is to go against or say the opposite of what someone else is doing or saying. Sometimes to contradict is to frustrate with words, like when one person says ""The sky is blue"" and another says ""No, it's azure.""</li><li>Denying or distorting the truth is a big part of trying to contradict. It can be harmless verbal back-and-forth, like when a husband and wife disagree just to disagree, or contradict each other to make a humorous point, but at other times people contradict something to make another person look like a liar. Often, a person who has lied will later contradict himself by saying something different from what he said earlier — and sometimes the two sides contradict each other, and neither is actually right.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2203,"<ul><li>If you leap tall buildings in a single bound for the Des Moines branch of your corporation, then your Metropolis counterpart might be Superman. That means you and Superman do similar jobs, but in different locations.</li><li>The noun counterpart comes from the French word countre part, meaning “duplicate of a legal document.” In legal circles counterpart still means ""a duplicate document,"" but today it is more likely to describe people. Counterparts aren't duplicates, of course, but they have similar skills and responsibilities. If you play soccer, your counterpart is the player on the other team who plays the same position.</li></ul>"

Sorry to say, your situation is devoid of all hope.</li><li>When you fall off a cliff, you fall into the void. Void means ""empty."" Devoid means ""empty of."" Always answer the question ""Of what?"" when you use it: ""My wallet is devoid of cash. My teacher is devoid of pity. My cookie jar is devoid of cookies."" These examples are devoid of anything not totally depressing!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2205,"<ul><li>When two roads diverge, they split and go in different directions. If your opinion diverges from mine, we do not agree. To diverge means to move apart or be separate.</li><li>The poet, Robert Frost, wrote: ""Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -/ I took the one less traveled by / And that has made all the difference."" The word diverge in the poem carries both the meaning of separating and of being apart from the main. As a poet, it was Frost's job to use words properly. Here he does not diverge from this role.</li></ul>"

Embryos still live in the womb or egg.</li><li>Do you remember when you were an embryo? Probably not, because you were just a tiny clump of cells in your mother's womb — you weren't born yet. All animals were embryos at one point: it's a very early stage of life. Another meaning is not as literal: the beginning of an idea could be called an embryo, as in, ""My plan for ice-skating robots is still in the embryo stage."" That means the idea isn't very developed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2207,"<ul><li>Finally means ""at the end of a long wait."" Although it seemed like it would never end, and in the middle you were cursing the day you signed up for the marathon, when you finally finished, you were overjoyed.</li><li>Final means ""last,"" so use the adverb finally to describe an end result or long-awaited satisfaction. Once the tedious dinner party was over, you finally got to go home and watch TV. If you're giving a speech and you have 14 different points that you're going to make, when you get to the last one, say ""finally..."" and then make the point. You can also say ""in conclusion..."" if that last point really sums it all up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2208,"<ul><li>A newspaper or journal can be called a gazette. In fact, many English-language newspapers from coast-to-coast include the name gazette in their title, from The Daily Hampshire Gazette in Massachusetts to the Mariposa Gazette in California.</li><li>The noun gazette comes from the Italian word gazzetta. In the 1600s, there was a Venetian news sheet that became known as a gazeta because it cost a gazeta, a small-valued Venetian coin. Other experts suggest that the word comes from gazza, a kind of bird — specifically a chattering magpie — that would spread news. A related word is gazetteer, which is a dictionary of geographical names.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2209,"<ul><li>If a group of things are homogeneous, they're all the same or similar, like a room full of identically dressed Elvis impersonators.</li><li>The adjective homogeneous comes from the Greek homogenes, meaning “of the same kind.” You can break down the root of the word further into two parts: homos, meaning “same,” and genos, meaning “kind, gender, race, stock.” It sounds very scientific, but if you look around the table at home and everyone is eating a bowl of oatmeal, you could safely describe your family’s breakfast tastes as homogeneous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2210,"<ul><li>The word individual is all about being a single entity that cannot be divided. It can mean person or even personal. A team is made up of individuals, and each individual has individual strengths and weaknesses.</li><li>Sometimes individual is a way of referring to a person, quasi-formally. You might elevate the phrase ""This guy walks into my shop,"" by saying, ""This individual walks into my shop."" You might also hear this word when talking about things that are divided: foods designed for lunchboxes, such as potato chips or juice boxes, are often prepackaged into individual servings.</li></ul>"

Michael Jackson's album ""Thriller"" was major, eventually becoming the biggest-selling album of all time.</li><li>A victory of 98 to 3 might well be called major. If you're a musician, you're probably also familiar with the difference between a minor scale and a major scale. A major scale sounds happy, while a minor one sounds sad.

If you’re gobbling down your pizza, a chunk of crust you didn’t chew so well might obstruct your airway and you'll choke.</li><li>Obstruct also means to get in the way so that you hide something from view. That fast food tower being built next to your beach house will obstruct your lovely ocean vistas. And that scene gives you a vivid illustration of the Latin roots the word comes from: ob- ""against,"" and struere, ""build."" You can also obstruct something or someone by putting up a roadblock, literal or figurative: when you park yourself by the exit door, you obstruct everybody's way out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2213,"<ul><li>Plunge is a noun and a verb related to diving, falling, and sinking. A ""polar bear plunge"" is when people plunge into freezing cold water for charity or, inexplicably, for fun.</li><li>As a noun, plunge means “a brief swim” or “a fall.” As a verb, plunge has a variety of definitions. Plunge can mean “to devote yourself fully,"" as you might plunge into a job by working day and night. Similarly, if you plunge into a good book, you don't let anything distract you from your reading. Plunge can also mean “fall abruptly.” Someone’s reputation might plunge after a scandal, or the stock market might plunge when investors react to bad news.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2214,"<ul><li>I don't want to prolong this definition, so I'll keep it short. To prolong is to make something last longer or to stretch it out in time.</li><li>You see the word long in prolong and it's no trick. If you prolong an argument with a sibling, you make it longer than it naturally would be. Prolong always has to do with time. When you stretch  your neck or a piece of cloth to make it appear longer, you are elongating, not prolonging, it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2215,"<ul><li>When you publicize something, you let the whole world know about it. The president might hold a press conference to publicize a new policy, or you might use Facebook to publicize your new relationship status.</li><li>To make something very widely known, or to make an official announcement about it, is to publicize it. Companies publicize new products and sale prices, and politicians publicize the missteps and bad policies of their opponents. The verb publicize was first used at the beginning of the twentieth century, combining public, with its Latin root of publicus, ""of the people, common, or general,"" and the verb-making suffix ize.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2216,"<ul><li>A surplus is something extra or left over. If your tree produces more apples than you can eat, you can make applesauce with the surplus of apples.</li><li>The army surplus store sells old or out-of-date clothing and equipment that the military doesn't need. If you earn more money than you spend, then you have a surplus of cash. The word surplus has  familiar parts: sur- is a shortened form of super, meaning ""extra"" or ""additional,"" and plus just means ""more.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2217,"<ul><li>To survive something is to live through it or endure it. You can survive a car accident, or you can survive your little brother's four-hour violin recital.</li><li>The verb survive is from the Latin word supervivere, “live beyond,” or “live longer than.” Originally to survive was used in the legal context as in “you survive your wife and therefore inherit her kingdom.” However, nowadays you might say that you were able to survive a holiday at your in-laws’, that your brother survived his first round of job interviews, or that you will never survive another all-day trip to the zoo in ninety degree heat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2218,"<ul><li>When you theorize, you come up with an explanation for how something happens, based on ideas that can be tested. You may theorize that your dog is afraid of loud noises after you see her cower under the bed during fireworks and thunderstorms.</li><li>When someone theorizes, they're not just making a wild guess. They're forming a theory, or a testable explanation that they can confirm through experimentation. After a scientist theorizes and the theory sticks around and is tested again and again in a rigorous way, it becomes an ""established theory,"" like the theory of gravity or plate tectonics theory. The Greek root theorein means ""to consider, speculate, or look at.""</li></ul>"

Can you verify that your cat was home all evening on the night of the canary's ""accident""?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U21_2220,"<ul><li>Anything vigorous is done with force and energy. Vigorous exercise makes you sweat, and a vigorous denial makes someone else sweat.</li><li>Vigorous is a description for something strong or enthusiastic. It comes from the French word vigour, meaning ""liveliness, activity."" An active, physically energetic person is vigorous, and mental activities can be vigorous too, when they require a lot of mental effort. A vigorous argument doesn’t have to include physical wrestling; it just might involve verbal sparring.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2221,"<ul><li>An altar is a raised area in a house of worship where people can honor God with offerings. It is prominent in the Bible as ""God's table,"" a sacred place for sacrifices and gifts offered up to God.</li><li>The word altar comes from the Latin altārium, meaning ""high,"" and also to the Latin adolere, which means ""to ritually burn or sacrifice,"" which suggests its early purpose as detailed in the Bible. Nowadays, the altar is the place for non-sacrificial religious rites such as communion or weddings, and is a metaphor for offerings. Comedian Stephen Fry once said, “I am a lover of truth, a worshipper of freedom, a celebrant at the altar of language and purity and tolerance.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2222,"<ul><li>Arthritis is a painful condition in which your joints swell and stiffen. It is common in older people, although it can affect anyone, including athletes who've injured knees, ankles, and hips.</li><li>There are said to be more than 100 types of arthritis. It can be a side-effect of aging; typically your cartilage — the tissue that acts as a padding around the joints — becomes stiffer and wears away. On the other hand, younger people can be affected through infections, injury, or obesity. Doctors do not yet know why some people get arthritis and others don't. Even great athletes like Michael Jordan had to deal with arthritis when they got older: it's common.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2223,"<ul><li>The study of plants is called botany. Each climate has its own particular botany, so if you study desert growth, you might focus on such plants as cactus and sage, while if you're in the jungle you'd study the lush growth there.</li><li>Someone once said, ""Botany is the science in which plants are known by their aliases."" Indeed, the study of botany includes learning the scientific names of plants. The origin of the word botany came from the Greek word botane, which means ""grass"" or ""pasture."" Since the original meaning focused on the idea of a pasture, it's possible the study of botany came about from herdsmen needing to know what plants were safe for their herds to eat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2224,"<ul><li>Someone who's credible is honest and believable. A pathological liar, for example, might not be the most credible witness for your case against the bank robber.</li><li>Similar to words like reliable and plausible, credible is an adjective that comes to us from the Latin credibilis, meaning “worthy to be believed.” A credible reputation is often earned through consistent good behavior and an overall trustworthy personality. Spill a secret you promised to keep, or lie under oath in a courtroom, and you lose all credibility.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2225,"<ul><li>When someone is deceased, they are dead — not dying or even just about to die. They are dead.</li><li>The word deceased has been around since the 15th century, however, when people talk of someone's having died, they rarely use deceased in conversation. For example, if you ask someone how their dog is and their dog is recently deceased, they'll most likely use a less technical phrase such as ""no longer with us,"" or ""passed away."" The word deceased is more formal, and most often used in the documentation of death or in legal situations, as in ""we are here to read the will of the deceased.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2226,"<ul><li>Deception is a trick or scheme used to get what you want, like the deception you used to get your sister to agree to do all your chores for a month.</li><li>Deception occurs when you deceive, a word that comes from the Latin de- meaning ""from"" and capere, meaning ""to take."" When you deceive someone, the result may be taking — like items you don't really need from people willing to give them, believing they are helping you. You may have heard the phrase ""take someone for a ride."" That's a way of describing deception.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2227,"<ul><li>A document is a piece of paper that contains official information. Don't you wish you had a document saying that the bank owed you $5 million?</li><li>Document comes from the Latin verb meaning ""to teach,"" so a document instructs you with the information it contains. Legal documents such as contracts contain instructions on how the people signing it will act. Passports, driver’s licenses and birth certificates are all official documents. As a verb, document means ""to record in detail,"" or ""offer supporting evidence for."" If you call a company to complain about something, make sure to document your phone calls by noting the date you called, who you spoke to and what was said.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2228,"<ul><li>Dung means animal droppings or waste. If you work at an elephant sanctuary, you're likely to spend a lot of time shoveling up elephant dung.</li><li>Dung is a tidy word for an untidy substance — animal poop. When farmers talk about cow dung or chicken dung, they'll probably call it manure instead. Some dung causes problems, like the runoff of pig dung into lakes and rivers, while other dung is used to help fertilize vegetable gardens. Dung is an Old English word, from a Germanic root — in Old High German, a tung was an underground room that was covered with dung for warmth.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2229,"<ul><li>Dusk is the period of time between sunset and nightfall. Many parents allow their children to roam freely in their neighborhood as long as they are home by dusk.</li><li>For some, dusk is seen as a mysterious, almost magical time, serving as the bridge between the brightness of day and the darkness of night. The English language contains numerous synonyms for dusk including crepuscule, evenfall, and gloaming. Owing perhaps to the mystical qualities associated with dusk, these words are better suited for poetry than for daily use.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2230,"<ul><li>To gratify is to satisfy. Bringing home an A in math would gratify your math tutor. 
Gratify can also mean to give in. You probably shouldn't gratify your urge to scream in class.</li><li>Gratify comes from the Latin gratificari, ""oblige,"" and gratus, ""pleasing."" The word still carries those meanings. Gratify always takes an object, so you have to gratify something or someone. Gratifying praise will make you feel good about all the work you put in on your science project. Gratify your thirst for vocabulary by using this word correctly!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2231,"<ul><li>The verb hone means to sharpen skills. When you practice shooting baskets every day after school, you are honing your skills as a basketball player.</li><li>Hone, the verb, literally means to sharpen with a hone, a whetstone used to sharpen cutting tools. Use hone to describe someone working hard, perfecting or sharpening skills, as in ""She is honing her skills as an actress by working in community theater."" Hone, which rhymes with phone, is from the Old English word, han, meaning ""stone, rock.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2232,"<ul><li>When you interpret something, you make sense of it. You could interpret a graph, a foreign language, or even Mona Lisa's odd smile.</li><li>If you're ordering food in a foreign land, you may need someone to interpret the menu for you. When you get tripped up or struggle to understand a subject even in your own language — like calculus, for example — sometimes you can find meaning, or interpret it for yourself. Or sometimes you'll need a teacher to work on the problem with you, showing how to interpret the mathematical language.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2233,"<ul><li>Your reason for doing something is your motive. Your motive to go to school every day is to learn. Or maybe the thought of your parents' anger and a run-in with the truant officer is motive enough.</li><li>The word motive comes from the Latin words motivus, meaning moving, and movere, meaning to move. Think of motive as the thing that moves you to act. You often hear of motive in the context of crime––a suspect’s fingerprints may be on the murder weapon, but a detective won’t understand the crime until he understands the motive. What made the killer act?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2234,"<ul><li>Pneumonia is a lung infection that gives you a cough and a fever and generally makes it difficult to breathe. If you catch pneumonia, you may end up in the hospital.</li><li>You've probably had people warn you not to go out in the rain without an umbrella or out in the cold without a hat or scarf because you’ll catch pneumonia. While they have your best interests in mind, you don’t actually get pneumonia from being cold or wet. Pneumonia is caused by viruses or bacteria. It’s a pretty common disease, but unfortunately it can be very serious in some cases, particularly in young children and elderly people.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2235,"<ul><li>A psychic reads minds and predicts the future. If you were a psychic, you wouldn't have bothered reading this because you would have known what I was going to say.</li><li>Psychic can also describe something that has to do with your mind more than your body. You weren't physically harmed when your favorite team lost the championship game, but the psychic pain was considerable. Psychic comes from a Greek word meaning “breath” and “soul”: psychic matters are often felt but not seen.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2236,"<ul><li>As an adjective, psychotic describes something that is of or related to an abnormal mental condition often characterized by delusions or hallucinations. Psychotic episodes, for example, are periods of mental instability when people lose contact with reality.</li><li>Psychotic is based on the Greek word psykhe, which means mind. As a noun, psychotic is a person suffering from psychosis — that is delusions, hallucinations, or any mental state that includes a loss of reality. Although the noun officially refers to the medical diagnosis, it is sometimes used as a slang to refer to anyone behaving in an erratic manner: ""Your friend is a total psychotic! He was jumping on the tables at lunch and shouting song lyrics.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2237,"<ul><li>Business people like to use the word scope because it specifies the extent of their responsibilities. Once you know the scope of a project, you can decide if you're qualified and how much time it will take to do it.</li><li>If your boss gives you a new task and you don't want to do it, tell him or her it's not within the scope of your duties. A scope is also a device used to see something in the distance.  You'll find one on shotguns, submarines, radars and the like. You can use scope as a verb meaning ""to look out or around."" When you and your friends go out, you probably scope out a few places to see where the action is.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2238,"<ul><li>People who are left-handed might feel unlucky having to use a desk designed for right-handers, but there probably wasn't any sinister, or evil, intent behind the design. Or was there?</li><li>In the 15th century, when the word sinister came into use in English, people who were left-handed were thought to be bad luck or even evil. In his play Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote of the villain holding a human skull in his sinister — i.e., left — hand. It would seem to be sinister, or wicked, enough to see a human skull in the right hand, not to mention unlucky for the person missing a head in the first place.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2239,"<ul><li>Strife is the act or state of fighting or arguing violently. The years leading up to the U.S. Civil War were characterized by great strife between northern and southern states over slavery and the role of a federal government.</li><li>This word applies to major issues and events, such as war and religious conflict: a period of civil strife. Like its Old French source, the original meaning of the English noun strife and the English verb strive had to do with an argument or quarrel. But the verb strive has lost that earlier sense, and now means to try hard to do or achieve something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U22_2240,"<ul><li>The text, or wording, of a book or article is made up of the original words that the author wrote.</li><li>In English papers, you have to quote from the text, or actual words in the book you're writing about. You might hear people talk about text in contrast to pictures. For example, a book's text and its pictures should get at the same ideas but in different ways. You translate, summarize or paraphrase a text, but there's only one original.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2241,"<ul><li>An artery is a major blood vessel that carries blood away from your heart. For a healthy heart, keep your arteries clean!</li><li>The word artery comes from the Greek arteria, which means ""windpipe."" In ancient times, an artery was thought to be a kind of air duct, because after someone dies, their arteries are empty of blood. Today we know that arteries (and veins) perform a vital job, constantly moving blood around our bodies. Systems of rivers or roads with networks and branches that resemble the human circulatory system can also be called arteries.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2242,"<ul><li>If something is in a state of deterioration, it's getting worse. A crumbling old house with a caved-in roof and foot-tall weeds growing through the deck is going through deterioration.</li><li>Deterioration implies that things are falling apart: something once in good condition is now weakened, worn out, or otherwise in decline. Things often undergo deterioration because of neglect. Time also has a lot to do with deterioration. Museum curators are always worried about stopping the deterioration of their prized antiquities, like the ancient Egyptian mummies that should not be exposed to air.</li></ul>"

It's not easy, because mice are quick and elusive — they're tough to catch. Rabbits are speedy, so they're elusive too. Also, things that are tough to understand or describe are elusive — like the concepts of love and beauty. If you had an idea and then forgot it, the idea is elusive: it slipped away. Anything you can't get hold of, with your hands or with your brain, is elusive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2244,"<ul><li>When you ensure that something will happen, you guarantee it. All that homework will ensure that you have no time for fun this afternoon!</li><li>Ensure comes from the Old French en- ""make"" plus seur ""sure,"" and that is exactly what it means today - ""to make sure or certain, to guarantee."" If you ensure success or someone's safety, you are guaranteeing it. Make sure you can really come through with something before you ensure it!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2245,"<ul><li>To induce is to move or lead someone to action. A promise of a lollipop can induce a toddler to do just about anything, even sit down and be polite to Aunt Edna. Older kids need something more substantial.</li><li>Some people believe that if you offer someone a large enough sum of money, you could induce them to do almost anything. But a movie heroine might say to the villain, ""Nothing could induce me to marry you. Not all the money in the world. Not if you were the last man on Earth!"" Induce also means to stimulate the occurrence of something, such as medications used to induce vomiting, or to induce a pregnant woman to go into labor.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2246,"<ul><li>People or things that are inseparable can't be separated. It's like they're glued together.</li><li>Usually, this word applies to people and is a bit of an exaggeration. Two friends who hang out every day are considered inseparable. Two people who are in love and spend most of their time together are inseparable. It's not that they can't be separated, but they don't want to be. Inseparable people love being together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2247,"<ul><li>A person who is very sick or injured and needs frequent care is an invalid. Also, something no longer current or useful is invalid.</li><li>The main uses of this word have to do with people and things that don't work very well anymore. A driver's license that has expired is invalid — it needs to be renewed. If you lost your health insurance, it's invalid. People who are called invalids are disabled or incapacitated severely. Be careful with this word, because some think it is inappropriate, since it sounds as if some people are not as valid as others based on physical capability.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2248,"<ul><li>To magnify is to make something bigger, whether in size or in significance.</li><li>A magnifying glass makes things look bigger and when anything is magnified, it gets larger in some way. If your hunger is magnified, you've gotten hungrier. Wearing a heavy coat on a hot day will magnify the heat: you're feeling hotter and hotter. Also, non-physical things get magnified. The press could magnify a story by discussing it over and over, making it a bigger story than it was originally. All types of magnifying make things bigger.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2249,"<ul><li>Mainstream describes what's viewed by most people in a society as ""normal,"" like the mainstream view that everyone should get married, move to the suburbs, and have children as soon as they can.</li><li>Something that's mainstream is conventional, or the usual way of doing things. If you're talking about the mainstream in fashion, you mean the ordinary clothes that most people wear and which is found in all the malls — nothing too weird or outlandish. In the 1600s, mainstream described the prevailing current of a river, with the first recorded use of its meaning of prevailing taste or opinion in 1831.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2250,"<ul><li>Microbe is a somewhat outdated way for scientists to talk about the tiny bugs that cause diseases. When you get the flu, you can blame a microbe.</li><li>In the nineteenth century, the idea that germs caused illness was brand new, and doctors referred to both germs and microbes interchangeably. The word microorganism is more scientifically precise, and in fact microbe is a shortened form of that long, Greek-rooted word. Mikro means ""small,"" and in microbe it's combined with bios, or ""life.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2251,"<ul><li>Something that's minor is considered of low importance — a minor injury is not very serious, and a college student's minor subject is a secondary field of study.  Likewise, the star constellation Ursa Major is a larger grouping than Ursa Minor.</li><li>The word minor has retained its spelling from the Latin. There, minor means something ""lesser,"" and is related to the Latin word minuere, which means ""to diminish."" It is usually used as an adjective, but as a noun it gained the meaning ""underage"" in the 16th Century, and is now used to refer to children and teens under the age of legal responsibility. It is also used in musical terms to refer to a key that has a flatted third in its scale.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2252,"<ul><li>When something is meaningless or insignificant because it is so little, it's negligible. The amount of interest you'll get on your savings is negligible, so you might as well spend your money.</li><li>If you work really hard on something, but the praise you get for it is negligible, you won't try so hard next time. Besides meaning very small, negligible can mean unimportant or not worth paying attention to. If you get into a fender-bender, you've gotten into a car accident with negligible damage. School concert programs always offer a word of thanks to the principal and other members of the administration whose role in the concert seems to be negligible.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2253,"<ul><li>Paralysis is the inability to move part of your body. It's actually fairly common for people to have short periods of paralysis while they sleep.</li><li>Paralysis is the experience of being paralyzed, or unable to move part or all of your body. There are medical conditions that can cause paralysis. You can also use paralysis to describe the inability to act, like the paralysis of a city during a big snowstorm, or the paralysis of the school play's star, suddenly struck with stage fright.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2254,"<ul><li>A pest is something or someone that bugs you. That annoying mosquito that keeps you up at night is a pest, and so is that younger brother who wants to control the TV remote.</li><li>An unwanted, bothersome person is a pest — and so is an unwanted, bothersome bug. In fact, the ""destructive or harmful insect"" definition came before ""annoying person,"" following the ""plague or pestilence"" meaning of pest. The Latin root is pestis, ""deadly contagious disease."" During the Late Middle Ages, when the bubonic plague killed a third of all humans, it was commonly known as ""the pest.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2255,"<ul><li>Prevail means to successfully persuade someone of something. If you were a Presidential advisor and you convinced him to make a National Day of Pet Appreciation, then you prevailed upon him to recognize pets.</li><li>Prevail can be used for different kinds of success. If you prevail upon someone, you have influence on them. If you prevail over someone, you win. Say you’re a big fan of a losing team. You might cheer, “Despite all odds, we will prevail!” To use prevail, there has to be some kind of contest or conflict. That could be internal, like when you have a pile of homework to do, but your desire to play video games prevails over your discipline.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2256,"<ul><li>A pursuit is a chase or a quest for something. When a guard runs after an escaping jewel thief, she's in pursuit — while the thief may have stolen the jewels because he was in pursuit of wealth.</li><li>Whether it's a police officer in a car chase or a student working towards a college degree at a university in the tropics, both can be considered in “hot pursuit.”  Derived from the Anglo-French purseute, pursuit means the act of pursuing or striving towards goals. In the late 14th century it implied persecution, but things have changed since then.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2257,"<ul><li>A rupture is a break or tear in something that pulls it apart. A rupture can be a literal break, like the one that happens in, say, a gas line, or it can be more figurative, as in a friendship or a business deal.</li><li>The oil spill was less of a spill than it was a rupture: the line leading to the well was severed, allowing the oil to flow into the ocean. Rupture works as both a noun and a verb. You can rupture the silence by screaming your head off, and any number of events in Star Trek can cause a rupture in the space-time continuum.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2258,"<ul><li>A polar bear in a zoo might look like an adorable giant stuffed animal, but if you met a hungry one in its native environment, it would seem more savage — wild and fierce — than cute.</li><li>Describing an animal as savage means that it is true to its wild, ferocious nature, but if you describe a person or the actions of a person as savage, it means ""cruel"" or ""brutal."" A place can also be described as savage if it's untamed, uninhabitable, and unwelcoming. When savage takes the form of a noun, it means ""a brutal person,"" and when it's a verb it means ""to attack ferociously."" Any way you use it, savage is uncivilized and violent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2259,"<ul><li>To stun is to knock unconscious or to shock. So getting hit in the head with a softball will stun you, but hearing that your favorite band is playing at the prom will also stun you.</li><li>If your cat catches a mouse, it may only stun the little animal and give you a chance to set it free. Being knocked hard enough in the head is generally what it takes to physically stun a person. It's more common for something that's astonishing to stun you, whether it's hearing terrible news or seeing something amazingly beautiful, like the northern lights or the Grand Canyon. Stun, in fact, shares a root with astonish.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U23_2260,"<ul><li>If you are susceptible to something such as infections or earaches, it means you are likely to become sick with these things.</li><li>Have you ever received something you don't want? Well, with susceptible meaning ""likely to be influenced or affected by"" that is probably going to be the case. If you're susceptible to flattery, and someone wants something from you, all they have to do is give you a compliment or two and you'll do what they want. Material that's susceptible to cracking won't be in good condition for long.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2261,"<ul><li>An advocate (AD-və-kit) is someone who supports a cause, like an advocate for outdoor recess. Advocate (AD-və-kate) is also a verb meaning to speak in favor of, so you can advocate for that outdoor recess by urging your school to play outside!</li><li>As a noun, an advocate is a person who represents another person’s interests, like a lawyer does. In fact, the word comes from the courtroom — it’s from Latin advocare, to “add” a “voice.” To advocate is to add a voice of support to a cause or person. An advocate is anyone who adds that voice by representing another person in court, or by supporting or working toward a particular course of action.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B04_U24_2263,"<ul><li>To authorize is to give official approval or clearance for something. Authorizing can also delegate power to someone.</li><li>Authorities are people with power, and to authorize is to use or grant some of that power to another. A visa authorizes you to visit a specific country. A search warrant authorizes the police to search a house. A doctor's note authorizes someone to miss work or school. Also, authorizing can be a form of delegating powers or responsibilities. The president of a company could authorize a worker to make a particular decision. Authorizing officially allows something to happen.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2264,"<ul><li>The most common meaning for civilian is simply someone who is not in the military. It can also refer to any object that is not military in origin — e.g., ""civilian clothes"" or ""civilian life.""</li><li>The meaning of civilian as a non military person is a relatively new one, dating from the early 19th century. Before that it referred to the code of law that governed non-military life. In fact for hundreds of years a civilian was somebody who was a judge or otherwise an expert on the law that applied outside military courts. Because it comes originally from a French word, remember to spell it with only one ""l,"" even though it sounds like it should have two.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2265,"<ul><li>A commodity is any useful or valuable thing, especially something that is bought and sold. Grain, coffee, and precious metals are all commodities.</li><li>The word commodity is usually used in an economic context, as in importing commodities from other countries or trading in the stocks and commodities markets. You probably wouldn't say something like ""I'm going to run to the corner store to pick up some commodities."" This word can also be used figuratively to refer to anything valuable, like trust or patience. Some people think that honesty is a rare commodity in politics.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2266,"<ul><li>To communicate is to exchange words, feelings, or information with others. They did communicate through texting and picture sharing, but the hug he gave his mom when he came home from college communicated more love than any instant message.</li><li>There are countless ways to communicate! Using an exclamation point in the first sentence is a way to communicate excitement at the many ways to use communicate. A facial expression can communicate joy or anger, and something written can communicate ideas and instructions. Cave men learned to communicate by drawing on cave walls, and people in modern times communicate electronically. Up close or far away, humans and animals — and some would say extraterrestrials, too — are born to communicate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2267,"<ul><li>Alexander the Great's famous conquest of the Persian Empire was an act of conquering. For Casanova, on the other hand, a conquest was an act of seduction.</li><li>Conquest derives from the Vulgar Latin word conquaerere, meaning ""to search for, procure by effort, or win."" In addition to its most commonly used meanings — conquering and seduction — conquest has a third, less well-known meaning: a success in mastering something difficult, like the violin, for instance, or flying an airplane.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2268,"<ul><li>Disclose means to reveal or expose information that has previously been kept a secret — like a politician might be forced to disclose his finances or former scandals while running for office.</li><li>When a politician, corporate executive, or celebrity announces that he or she has something to disclose, the public listens. They know that the information they're about to hear was kept secret for a reason. Something incriminating or juicy is about to be revealed, like a secret affair or plummeting company profits.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2269,"<ul><li>Dynamics refers to the branch of mechanics that deals with the movement of objects and the forces that drive that movement. If you're taking a physics class, you will likely study dynamics.</li><li>Dynamics has its origins in the Greek word dynamis, ""force, power."" In physics, dynamics is the study of bodies in motion and changes in that motion, and that idea can be applied to other areas as well. For example, we refer to ""group dynamics"" as the way people interact and work together. George W. Bush once observed, ""Globalization has altered the dynamics in the White House, as well as between the White House and the Treasury.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2270,"<ul><li>If you like clowning around but you're not quite ready for the circus, you could enroll in clown college to perfect your skills. When you enroll, that means you formally add your name to the list — or roll — of students.</li><li>You can enroll in things other than schools or classes, and you can also enroll someone else. You might enroll your Chihuahua in a research project investigating whether dogs like to wear hats, or you could enroll your rude nephew in charm school. The ""roll"" of enroll goes back to the rolls of parchment that were used in medieval times for writing official documents.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2271,"<ul><li>Envious is another way to say jealous or resentful — in other words, you want what someone else has, whether it's charming good looks or the last chocolate frosted donut.</li><li>Once upon a time, envious meant “eager to emulate.” Now a days this adjective is used to describe covetous feelings or a state of painful desire. Envious usually isn't a good thing to be; it's better to let it go and be happy with what you've got. Just remember the words of the wise Greek philosopher Antisthenes: ""As iron is eaten away by rust, so the envious are consumed by their own passion.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2272,"<ul><li>Festive describes an event that’s full of joy, smiles, and excitement. A birthday party without presents, decorations, or friends would be the opposite of festive.</li><li>People having a great time — that’s a sure sign that the occasion is festive.  An awesome party, New Year’s Eve, the last day of school, Fridays: happy times where the air feels electric, that’s festive.  It can also describe your mood, like when you feel full of energy and ready to dance.  Sharing the same Latin root (festivus) as the words festival and feast, festive events often involve good food and great people.  And a piñata always helps.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2273,"<ul><li>To indicate means to point something out or to present evidence. If you feel sick during a car trip, you can indicate this to the driver by groaning loudly or announcing ""I'm going to be sick!""</li><li>Scientists rely on data from experiments to indicate whether their theories are correct. Indicate can also describe a symptom or signal of something else. For example, a stock market recovery could indicate growing public confidence — or foolishness, depending on which expert you ask. The verb indicate comes from the noun indication, which in turn comes from the Latin word indicare, meaning ""something that points out or shows.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2274,
4000EEW_B04_U24_2275,"<ul><li>A federal marshal knocks on your door. You panic: a marshal is a law officer. What do you do? You marshal your thoughts, that is, put them in order.</li><li>Marshal derives from the Old French mareschal, for stable officer. The stable officer had charge of the horses, tending to them, putting them in order, readying them for action. If you are a marshal, you're an officer. If you marshal yourself, you get yourself ready, preparing for action.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2276,"<ul><li>Morale is the spirit a group has that makes them want to succeed. It's a sense of well-being that comes from confidence, usefulness, and purpose.</li><li>We often talk about the morale of groups in tough situations, and we can describe them as having ""good morale"" or ""low morale."" If too many members of a combat unit are killed and the surviving soldiers start to doubt they’ll make it home alive, then their morale is very very low. We can also talk about individual morale. In order to succeed, a sailor on a solo trip around the world needs plenty of ways to keep her morale up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2277,"<ul><li>Are you feeling good or bad, cheerful or irritable right now? This is your mood.</li><li>Mood refers to how you feel at the present time. If you want to ask your boss for a raise, wait until he or she is in a good mood. Don't ask, though, if he or she is ""in a mood"" - that means the person is grumpy. If you are in the mood for something like ice cream or spicy food, you would like to have it now. Mood can also describe the attitude of a group of people or the feeling of a film, novel or piece of music.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2278,"<ul><li>If a fortune teller made a prophecy that you were going to become a billionaire in your lifetime, you'd be pretty excited. A prophecy is a prediction, or a magical look into the future.</li><li>The noun prophecy means a magical foreknowledge, although it can also be used in a playful way to describe an ordinary guess or prediction about the future. So you could say, ""Her prophecy for the weather next week is incredibly depressing."" The word comes from the Greek prophetia — literally, ""gift of interpreting the will of the gods"". The verb form is prophesy, or predict, and it's spelled with an s instead of a c.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2279,"<ul><li>When a government is split into two houses, or assemblies, one of them — the ""upper house"" — is called a senate. The main job of most senates is to take a second look at legislation after it's been passed by the lower house.</li><li>The idea of a senate as a legislative assembly goes back to the founding of Rome, around 750 B.C.E., with the word taken from the Latin senatus, meaning ""highest council."" That word, then, is thought to come from senex, meaning ""old man,"" in this case probably meant as a form of respect for wisdom. The word later grew to include national government, and the United States took the word in 1775 to refer to the upper level of the legislature.  Today, you can get elected to a senate even if you're not an old man.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U24_2280,"<ul><li>Unrest is an uneasy, agitated, or disturbed condition. Strikes and public protests are often part of social and political unrest.</li><li>There's a personal, small-scale kind of unrest, like the unrest caused at a birthday party by one extremely unhappy child, or the unrest that results from a class clown's practical jokes. Then there's the societal unrest that results in angry public demonstrations. Unsafe working conditions might lead to unrest among laborers, and a government's authoritarian rule often results in unrest too, with citizens marching in the streets.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2281,"<ul><li>To certify is to provide proof for something or to license someone, like a lawyer. You can certify a lawyer or certify that someone’s insane. Either way, when you certify something, you make it official.</li><li>To certify is to have evidence that something is true, to make certain. If you certify that you own a house, you prove it's yours. Vouching for a friend can certify that the friend is a good person. Professionals like lawyers, doctors, and accountants must be certified. Being certified assures others that the person is qualified. Certify also refers to declaring someone legally insane, so make sure your doctor is certified by the medical board, not the loony bin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2282,"<ul><li>Something coherent is logical and clear. ""I told you if you didn't do your homework you couldn't watch TV. You didn't do your homework so you can't watch TV."" This is a coherent argument (and annoying as well).</li><li>The thing about such coherent arguments, as your Mom well knows, is that they are also easily and clearly understood. If someone speaks coherently, they are speaking clearly and lucidly. A slight variation on the meaning comes in the sense of something that is united clearly as a whole and a recognizable entity. You might say, for example, that New York City is a ""culturally coherent region"" within the United States.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2283,"<ul><li>When you work together on shared goal, you collaborate. If you don't just split a project up evenly but work together on creating solutions, you collaborate.</li><li>Inside the word you see co-labor, or ""working together."" Cooperation is simply splitting up the work and getting it done. Collaboration is when you brainstorm, create, and share possible solutions. During World War II, however, Nazi collaborators were sharing ideas with the wrong side. In today's pop music scene, collaboration means featuring a guest star on a record, and it's often a surefire way to boost sales.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2284,"<ul><li>When you compile something, like a recipe-book or a mix-tape, you put it together using things that already exist (recipes, songs).</li><li>Poetry anthologies, greatest-hits albums, and world-record books are all compilations, because they're made up of things that were originally published or released somewhere else. If you want to skip out on soccer practice one day, you might compile of list of excuses.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2285,"<ul><li>The hard thing about learning how to parallel park is trying to get the car close enough to the curb without hitting it. A curb is the edge of the sidewalk beside the road.</li><li>When you're using the word curb as a noun, it's the raised edging beside a street. When curb is a verb, it means to restrain or hold back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a badly acted play. Curb comes from the Latin word for ""curve,"" curvus, which describes the shape of a restraining strap on a horse's head — in the fifteenth century, this band was called a curb.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2286,"<ul><li>If you diagnose a disease, you recognize it by the signs and symptoms your patient shows. Your high temperature and the green crud you keep coughing up will allow your doctor to diagnose your bronchitis.</li><li>The verb diagnose was first used in medicine, meaning ""make a diagnosis,"" or identify a disease by observation of symptoms. Use it to describe the process of figuring it out. If you have bad gut pain, ask your doctor to diagnose your condition. You can also use diagnose for other problems, like if you diagnose poverty and malnutrition as the real causes of a student's terrible behavior, or diagnose the virus that caused your computer to crash.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2287,"<ul><li>You often hear that Congress is going to enact a new statute, which means that they will make it into a law. But enact also means to perform, like in a play. (Makes you wonder if the lawmakers are actors!)</li><li>Inside the word enact is that little word act, meaning “to do.” That makes sense, because when you enact something, you make it happen. And of course, we know that to act also means to perform, and so enact means “to act out,” like on stage.  Now that the new rules have been enacted, you'll have to stop wearing your gorilla suit to work.  Even after Labor Day.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2288,"<ul><li>A federation is an organization made up of smaller groups, parties, or states. The United States is a federation; the states all fall under the same federal government.</li><li>The word federation may be most familiar as part of the name of an organization — for example, the International Tennis Federation, the American Advertising Federation, or the National Wild Turkey Federation. If you follow World Cup soccer, you may be interested to learn that the acronym FIFA stands for Fédération Internationale de Football Association. Although the groups within a federation are united around a common goal or ideology, they usually like to keep some control at the local level as well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2289,"<ul><li>Get ready, because gross has a few different meanings. When something is gross, it's disgusting. The noun, a gross, is the complete amount (before expenses), and the verb ""to gross"" is to bring in money.</li><li>Two things will tell you which meaning is the right one with a word like gross: the part of speech and the context. If you're talking about awful, sickening, vile things, you're looking at the adjective gross. If you're referring to, say, how much money a movie made, that's the noun gross; but remember, the gross is how much the movie made in total, not how much it cleared in profit after expenses (the net). As a noun, gross can also be a unit of measurement: if your teacher orders a gross of pencils, he'll get a shipment of 12 dozen. The verb to gross means to pull in money, as in: the bake sale grossed 30 dollar.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2290,"<ul><li>A humane person is one who shows great compassion and caring for others, including animals, and who tries whenever possible to alleviate another's suffering.</li><li>The idea of being humane is linked to a higher level of a person's character. While the word is derived from the word human, the sad fact is that a person can be human without being humane. Britain's Royal Humane Society, created in 1774 to rescue drowning people, focuses on recognizing acts of human bravery. In the United States, however, the Humane Society works to eliminate cruelty to animals. Still, both focus on kindness and the humane care of others.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2291,"<ul><li>People who are needy don't have enough of life's necessities, like money, food, water, education, or shelter. Many charities collect money that helps needy people.</li><li>Truly needy people go without food or warmth, for example, and often need help from others. As a group, these people are sometimes referred to as ""the needy.""  A more lighthearted way to use the adjective is to mean ""demanding or difficult."" This type of needy person requires frequent reassurance or emotional support: ""She's a good friend, but she can be so needy sometimes.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2292,"<ul><li>When something is at its onset, it's at the beginning, just getting started, and it's often something that's not so pleasant. The onset of hurricane season is probably not the best time to visit the beach.</li><li>If you catch an infection right at the onset and treat it immediately, the infection may not last so long. You can also have an early onset of something, and that usually means something you'd rather not have at all, as with early-onset Alzheimer's, a disease that usually appears after age 65. If you begin showing signs of the disease at a younger age than usual, you're said to have early-onset Alzheimer's.</li></ul>"

You can pledge allegiance to your country, you can pledge to keep a secret, and you can pledge a sum of money to a cause.</li><li>Pledge can be used as both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it can be a solemn promise you've made. Or even the person who makes that promise, like the freshman pledges who take an oath to join a fraternity in college. As a verb, it describes the act of promising. “I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people,” vowed Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2294,"<ul><li>If a sign says ""Swimming Prohibited,"" don't go for a dip. It's not allowed. To prohibit is to forbid, or to disallow something.</li><li>In school, you are prohibited from leaving the premises before the end of the school day. The school administration also prohibits smoking and chewing gum. In 1920, it became illegal to sell alcohol in the United States. This time period when alcohol was prohibited is known as the era of Prohibition. Famously Prohibition did not work. When you prohibit something, you often make it seem more appealing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2295,"<ul><li>Render is a synonym of ""make"" — technically it means ""cause to become."" An illness might render you unable to walk, or a shocking sight might render you speechless.</li><li>Another basic meaning of the verb render is to give, present, or perform something: you could render assistance to someone in need, for example. And a specialized sense is to formally declare a verdict in a court case. Render derives from the Latin verb reddere, ""to restore,"" from the prefix re-, ""back,"" plus dare, ""to give.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2296,"<ul><li>Smallpox was a deadly, contagious virus that left survivors scarred and often blind. A smallpox vaccine was developed in 1796, but the disease wasn't officially eradicated until 1980.</li><li>Smallpox is a great example of what vaccination campaigns can accomplish. During the 20th century, there were as many as 500 million deaths from smallpox. It was particularly dangerous for children, 80 percent of whom died from it after being infected. Smallpox was notable for the rash of pustules it caused on the skin, as well as a high fever and muscle pain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2297,"<ul><li>When you transform you change from one thing or state to another. Picture a transformer that changes from a robot to a car. Simple, right?</li><li>Caterpillars transform into butterflies, a forest is transformed by a snowfall, and a city can be transformed by a new government or a changing economy. Transform means a big change in appearance or  in essence. The Internet has transformed how we live our day-to-day lives, but you wouldn't say that moving a throw pillow has transformed your living room.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2298,"<ul><li>If you’re an international spy, you might transmit secret messages using a special code written in invisible ink. If you aren’t a spy, you could probably just use email. Whatever your circumstances, when you transmit information, you send.</li><li>You can transmit things from person to person or from one thing to another. The airwaves can be used to transmit radio or TV signals, for example, and computers can transmit messages over a network. This verb often describes messages or data being sent, but you can also transmit ideas, beliefs, or attitude. In addition, transmit can describe the spread of disease, like mosquitoes that can transmit disease when they bite.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2299,"<ul><li>To vow is to make an earnest promise or pledge. People getting married often vow to stick together “till death do us part,” while a presidential candidate might vow to lower taxes.</li><li>You can use vow as both a noun and a verb: A vow is a solemn declaration; to vow is the act of making that promise. Vows are meant to be serious, sacred things, even vows made with the best intentions can be broken. Wrote American short-story writer and poet Dorothy Parker, “By the time you swear you are his, shivering and sighing, And he vows his passion is infinite and undying—Lady, make a note of this: One of you is lying.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U25_2300,"<ul><li>Widespread means far-reaching. For years, email was used only by computer programmers and technophiles. It was hard to imagine, back then, how widespread the phenomenon of digital communication would become.</li><li>An idea that's widespread, is believed by many people, even if it's not true. A person such as Oprah, Gandhi, or Beyoncé, who has widespread popularity, is loved by many far and wide. A widespread disease is one that many people have — the flu epidemic of 1919 was deadly and widespread.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2301,"<ul><li>If you don't want monkey droppings to adhere to the sole of your shoe, watch where you’re walking. Maybe if you'd adhere, or stick to, the zoo rules and stay on the walking path, you wouldn't have to worry about it.</li><li>Adhere is from the 15th-century French verb meaning ""to stick."" Things that are sticky will adhere, or attach, to surfaces and stay there, whether you want them to or not; in other words, they're adhesive, an adjective that comes from the same Latin source as the French verb. When a person chooses to adhere to something, it is more of a choice to stick with it or agree to abide by rules or guidelines. You can also adhere by being loyal, as when you adhere to the high moral standards or behavior expected of some organization.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2302,"<ul><li>When you administer something, you give it to others. This can apply to a dose of medicine, an order, a survey, or a punishment. Administer can also mean to run something — such as a school or an office.</li><li>The word administer belongs to a family of words, all having to do with being in charge: administration, administrator, and administrative. Strangely, administer comes from the Latin word minister meaning ""servant."" So, if your boss or principal administers an instruction that you disagree with, just think of that person as your servant. Doing so will help you carry out your duties with a smile.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2303,"<ul><li>If you are compassionate, you feel other people's pain and struggles as though they were your own.  Compassionate people are often moved to work to end the suffering of others, perhaps by feeding the hungry or educating the poor.</li><li>Compassionate comes from the Old French noun compassion, which means ""sympathy, pity."" The adjective, pronounced ""cuhm-PASH-uh-nuht,"" means ""sympathetic,"" like a compassionate friend who shares in your joys and sadnesses, wanting the best for you. As a verb, compassionate, here pronounced ""cuhm-PASH-uh-nate,"" means ""pity,"" as in your ability to compassionate with stray dogs and cats.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2304,"<ul><li>The verb contaminate means the same as pollute. Whether it’s food, air, or water, when you contaminate something, you make it impure or hazardous.</li><li>Contaminate comes from the Latin word contaminat-, meaning “made impure.” You can use the word to indicate that a hazardous substance has been introduced into something else, such as food that is contaminated with mold. It can also be used figuratively to describe the spoiling of a good thing, like one person's habit of gossiping that can contaminate a conversation among friends.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2305,"<ul><li>A deficiency is an insufficient amount of something. If you feel sluggish and tired all day, you might have an iron deficiency, meaning you aren't eating enough iron-rich foods.</li><li>You are most likely to hear the word deficiency in regard to health, like a sleep deficiency. But you can use deficiency to describe other kinds of lack — a deficiency of fun that occurred while your friends were out of town. Deficiency also means a failure or shortcoming, like a deficiency in math class, which might result in a notice from school — known as a deficiency — being mailed to your home.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2306,"<ul><li>While the emphasis, or main focus, for walking a dog might be on ""answering the call of nature,"" the emphasis for the dog might be on chasing squirrels.</li><li>If you say emphasis a little louder or with extra oomph in your pronunciation, you are putting emphasis on the word. This emphasis makes it clear that special attention, or emphasis, should be given to the word. Now, having repeated emphasis so many times, the ""s"" sound really stands out, sort of like in the word ""stress."" When you stress a point, you put emphasis on something — it is the main thing, the emphasis.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2307,"<ul><li>An epidemic is a disease that spreads rapidly among many people in a community at the same time. In the 1980s, the fast-spreading AIDS epidemic transformed life on our planet.</li><li>Epidemic can be used figuratively to refer to something that spreads or grows rapidly: an epidemic of laziness has taken over the tenth grade. This word is from French épidémique, ultimately from Greek epidēmia ""staying in one place, among the people."" The related word pandemic refers to a disease that spreads throughout an entire country or throughout the world.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2308,"<ul><li>If something is a hazard, it is a potential source of danger. Balloons are fun, but they're a hazard for little kids who might put them in their mouths.</li><li>If you play miniature golf, you have to watch for hazards on the course — obstacles like the sand trap beside the dinosaur or the water hazard just past the windmill. As a verb, hazard means to take a risk, especially for the chance of a good return. You might hazard your chances at the roulette table or hazard a guess — that is, risk making a guess when you aren't certain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2309,"<ul><li>When something absolutely has to be done and cannot be put off, use the adjective imperative.</li><li>Imperative is from Latin imperare, ""to command,"" and its original use was for a verb form expressing a command: ""Do it!"" is an imperative sentence. The word is still used that way, but it's more commonly applied to something so pressing it cannot be put off: ""It's imperative that we hire more workers if we want to complete the job on time.""  Imperative has more immediate force than pressing but less than urgent.</li></ul>"

You might manifest your dislike of school food by stirring it around into a big pile of slop on your tray.</li><li>Coming from the Latin manifestus, ""caught in the act,"" manifest can be used as an adjective or a noun as well as a verb. As an adjective, manifest is a formal way to say that something is apparent to the senses and is synonymous with evident, apparent, or clear. If you have strong feelings about something, they will be manifest on your face. A ship or plane's manifest is the list of cargo or passengers on a particular trip.</li></ul>"

Every yoga practitioner started by attending an introductory class.</li><li>In practitioner, you can see the word practice, which everyone says will make you perfect. Practice can also mean the clients, daily activities, and location where a professional such as a doctor works. So a practitioner is someone who has learned everything about his or her field and is actively working in that field. So don't worry about going to the doctor — you won't be practice for this practitioner.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2314,"<ul><li>A provision is a store or supply of something, like food or clothing. This noun can also describe the planning you do for ""when something happens.""</li><li>We often use this word when we talk about outdoor activities like hiking or camping, or when we talk about outfitting an army in the field, but it basically means ""supply."" And since provision comes from the Latin word that means to ""attend to,"" you can pretty much guess what the verb form of this word describes: the act of supplying someone else with provisions. In a legal or contractual sense, a provision is a stipulated condition or proviso.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2315,"<ul><li>To replenish something is to refill it. If you have a pet pooch, you’re probably obligated to replenish his food bowl to avoid being barked at incessantly.</li><li>Use replenish when talking about something valuable or desirable, such as money or food. For example, you might discuss replenishing your bank account, but you wouldn’t speak of replenishing a trash can. You can also use replenish in a joking way to show that something is of value to you; by noting that the jar of jellybeans on your desk needs to be replenished, you indicate that you require jellybeans to survive your day at the office. We get that.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2316,"<ul><li>To go in reverse, you back up. If you reverse your position, you suddenly take the opposite side of the argument. If you reverse your fortunes, your bad luck turns good, or your good luck turns bad. Oops.</li><li>The Latin word revertere means “turn back.” To reverse means to turn back, take the opposite direction, go the other way. Many things can be reversed: you can reverse a decision, you can reverse a car — by putting it in the gear called ""reverse."" You can reverse a political argument, a promotion, even some surgical procedures, but you can never reverse the steady progress of time, no matter how many Botox injections you get.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2317,"<ul><li>A sterile person can't have kids, and a sterile environment is bland and boring. In both cases, sterile means lifeless.</li><li>When you hear about a sterile person, it means they can't have kids: sterile women can't get pregnant, and sterile men can't be fathers. But the concept of sterility applies to things, too. An empty, white room with nothing in it is sterile. And a surgeon's instruments better be sterile — meaning they're free from germs and bacteria.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2318,"<ul><li>To upgrade is to make improvements to something or exchange it for a better version. Some people upgrade their phone every time a new model comes out, while others prudently wait to see which new features they really need.</li><li>Upgrade is also a noun: ""I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to the first-class section of the plane!"" Whether a noun or a verb, this word commonly used to refer to electronic equipment, particularly computers and smartphones. If a company upgrades the network in their offices, they purchase new computers or improve internet connection speeds. The original meaning of the noun upgrade was ""sloping up,"" as in a steep hill.</li></ul>"

A viable seed can develop into a plant, while a viable company has the resources to succeed.</li><li>The adjective viable refers to something able to function properly and even grow. It is made up of the Latin root vita, which means ""life,"" and the ending -able, which means ""to be possible."" In terms of science or botany, when a plant is viable it can live and flourish in an environment such as a cactus in the desert. Consider also the Wright brothers, who were the first to develop a viable airplane after many tries and spectacular failures.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U26_2320,"<ul><li>Voluntary is an adjective that describes something you do because you want to, without being influenced or forced into it. Usually a voluntary act is something you consciously choose to do, like going into work even on a snow day.</li><li>Voluntary comes from the Latin word voluntarius, which means ""of one's free will."" Voluntary can also describe a service given without any payment expected in return. For example, if your work for the community theater is voluntary, that means that you don't get paid for your time. If you're offering your voluntary help in this way, you might also be called a volunteer, someone who offers free help to assist others.</li></ul>"

In fact, being almighty gives something (or someone) an infinite amount of power.</li><li>Originally, the adjective almighty was capitalized and used to refer to God. It comes from the Old English ælmihtig, ""all-powerful."" You could also describe something that's almighty as ""omnipotent"" or even ""godlike."" Today people often use almighty in a sarcastic or ironic way to talk about things that exert a ridiculously huge amount of control over people: ""All he cares about is the almighty dollar.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2323,"<ul><li>The advent of something means that it's finally here. You might be waiting for the advent of a new iPhone or for the advent of cloning. Don't hold your breath.</li><li>Generally, the noun advent is used for the introduction of something important. The twentieth century saw the advent of many important inventions — including television, computers, and microwave dinners. If the word is capitalized, it has a religious meaning, referring to the period, observed in certain Christian religions, that begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas (December 25).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2324,"<ul><li>A cycle is a series of events that happen repeatedly in the same order. Or, it is a slang term for a bicycle. If you ride a cycle to work, we suggest putting your clothes through the wash cycle twice — or wear strong cologne.</li><li>We get cycle  from Latin cyclus and Greek kuklos, both meaning ""circle."" So you can see where bi- (two) and tri- (three) + cycle got their names. Nowadays, cycle can be a verb or a noun: You can ride a cycle or you can cycle to the park. The same holds true when you’re talking about a sequence of repeating events: The seasons cycle through spring, summer, fall, and winter. The plant life cycle goes from seed to flower to seed dispersal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2325,"<ul><li>A definitive answer is a final one. A definitive decision by a court of law is one that will not be changed. A definitive translation is one everyone turns to as correct. Definitive means authoritative, conclusive, final.</li><li>Be careful not to confuse definitive with definite. Definite means clearly defined. You can have a definite opinion that JFK could not have been assassinated by a lone gunman, but the definitive interpretation remains that of the Warren Commission Report, which held there was only one.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2326,"<ul><li>When you equate one thing with another, you say that they are both the same. You might equate indulging in a hot fudge sundae with giving up on your body entirely, but I would disagree.</li><li>To equate means to make things equal, and it’s a useful word because this is something people do all the time. They equate strong political views with fascism, they equate having lots of money with good taste, and they equate popularity with goodness. Remember, though, that just because you equate one thing with another does not mean that they really are the same! As you have no doubt noticed, equate has the Latin root equ that means ""equal, level,"" so look there if you need a reminder as to its meaning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2327,"<ul><li>To found something is like laying a ""foundation"" for a building — note the similarity?  But instead of a building, you might found a business or a charity, where you establish the groundwork upon which it can grow.</li><li>The verb found goes back to the Latin word fundus, meaning ""bottom,"" which in turn led to fundāre, meaning ""to lay the bottom of something.""   If you were to found a library, they might build a statue of you near the entrance.  If you're having trouble finding the library, look for a statue with a familiar face.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2328,"<ul><li>An ideology is a set of opinions or beliefs of a group or an individual. Very often ideology refers to a set of political beliefs or a set of ideas that characterize a particular culture.</li><li>Capitalism, communism, socialism, and Marxism are ideologies. But not all -ism words are. Think: cronyism (a system of graft whereby friends unfairly help each other make money.) Our English noun is from French idéologie. The suffix –logy, used with many English words describing theories or doctrines, is from Greek logos ""word, reason, speech, account.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2329,"<ul><li>To inhale is to breathe in. It is the opposite of ""exhale,"" which is to breathe out.</li><li>When we inhale, we draw air into our lungs through our noses and mouths. Then we exhale, or breathe the air out again. If we do this slowly, as in yoga or meditation, it can be quite relaxing. However, some things like smoke, toxic fumes, or germs might make us sick if we inhale them. And if we accidentally inhale water while we're swimming, it makes us sputter and cough. This is because our lungs are only interested in good, clean air.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2330,"<ul><li>To invoke is to call up something such as a law, a higher power, or even a ghost. In court, you might invoke the Fifth Amendment (the right not to say something that will make you look bad) if you don't want to talk.</li><li>You can invoke all kinds of people or ideas, alive or dead: ""She invokes the spirit of good writing when she proofreads her work."" In a time of need, you might invoke a higher power. You could invoke Martin Luther King when talking about equal rights. You might even invoke the spirit of your dead cat at a séance. Just make sure you don't evoke (to bring on a strong emotional reaction) your dead cat; that would just be weird.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2331,"<ul><li>The adjective lunar is used to describe something that is related to the moon. If you like astronomy, you probably enjoy lunar eclipses, when the Earth casts its shadow on the moon.</li><li>Lunar comes from the Latin word luna, meaning moon. The Roman goddess of the moon is called Luna (Selene in Greek mythology). There are lunar eclipses, a lunar calendar, lunar tides, and lunar orbits.

Many college freshmen enjoy the novelty of living on their own — until it comes time to do that first load of laundry.</li><li>You'll often hear people talk about the novelty of a new experience —  imagine the excitement and anticipation of cracking open a novel you’ve never read before to help remember the word. But novelty is also a term for a small toy or trinket, usually mass-produced. Novelty shops sell all kinds of funny knickknacks, from personalized flashlight key chains to stuffed singing hamsters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U27_2333,"<ul><li>Something that is outmoded is no longer cool or in style, like your dad's outmoded hairstyle that he's had since he was in high school.</li><li>The French are known for their sense of fashion and style, so it's no surprise that they coined the word démodé to describe things that are no longer cool. De- means ""out, off, away"" and mode means ""fashion."" The English word outmoded is simply a translation of démodé: ""out of fashion"" or ""out of style.""</li></ul>"

You could talk about a psychiatric nurse, a psychiatric hospital, or psychiatric drugs, for example. Any time you see a word that begins with psych you can be sure it has to do with the mind, since psykhe is ""mind"" in Greek. The suffix iatreia means ""healing or care.""</li></ul>"

It's not something you want to happen. Criminals may think the seizure of a wealthy person can bring them a fortune in ransom money. Another kind of seizure is the kind caused by a misfire of electrons in the brain, causing a loss of control of the body. It too is an unwanted taking over by force.</li></ul>"

Resources are also often allocated. Teachers, for example, are continuously allocating their year's supply of resources so they don't run out of glue sticks and paper before the end of the school year.</li></ul>"

An appetizing plate of cheesy nachos might make your mouth water.</li><li>Use the adjective appetizing when you talk about food that's tempting or makes you hungry. The smell of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies is appetizing, and so is the summertime aroma of your neighbor's grill. Appetizing comes from the noun appetite, or ""craving for food,"" from the Old French apetit, ""appetite or desire."" The Latin root is appetere, ""long for, strive for, or grasp at.""</li></ul>"

If your sisters fight over whose turn it is to sit in the front seat, your parents may have to assign turns.</li><li>The verb assign also means to transfer legal rights. You assign the deed to your house to new owners when you sell it. If you sort things into categories by characteristics, you are assigning them categories. When you make a budget, you assign each expense a category. Food and housing, for example, may be essential living expenses and medicine and doctor's visits may be health care. Chocolate gets its own category.</li></ul>"

If you have a cavity, you have a hole in your tooth, and it’s time to go to the dentist for a filling. Lucky you.</li><li>Doctors sometimes refer to various internal body parts as cavities, such as the ""abdominal cavity,"" which includes the stomach and other hollow parts of the abdomen. You are more likely to hear the word at the dentist’s office, when she finds a cavity, which is a space in your tooth that's been eaten away by decay. Fun! (Not.) Cavity shares the Latin root cavus, ""hollow,"" with the word cave.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2345,
4000EEW_B04_U28_2346,"<ul><li>Concentric describes something, like circles, that have a common center.</li><li>Concentric is from the Latin word concentricus, from com (""together"") plus centrum (""center"" or ""circle""). So, concentric things have a center in common. If you play darts, you aim for the smallest red dot of those colorful concentric circles. Although it's usually used to describe circles, ideas can also be concentric if they have a common point, such as when your dreams revolve around a concentric theme of flying. The opposite word is eccentric (""not having a common center"") like that oddball neighbor you have nothing in common with.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2347,"<ul><li>A courtesy is a polite remark or respectful act. Complain about a bad meal, and you might get kicked out. But the common courtesy is usually an apology from the manager and, if you're lucky, a free dinner.</li><li>Courtesy is all about using your good manners, which is why it shares roots with the word courteous. Holding the door open for someone, writing a thank-you note for a gift, and letting the pregnant lady have the last seat on the bus are all courtesies that would make your parents proud. And if something is kindly presented to you free of charge, the gift-giver may say it's ""courtesy of"" someone special.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2348,"<ul><li>Something that's crisp is thin, dry, and breakable. Unless they're stale, most crackers are crisp.</li><li>Gingersnaps are crisp, and so is toast — in fact, crisp often describes food, although crunchy snow and dry, brown leaves are also crisp. To crisp something is to cook or dry it until it's brittle, and when a voice is crisp, it's abrupt and no-nonsense. A crisp fall morning is fresh and cold. In Old English, crisp meant ""curly,"" from the Latin crispus, ""curled."" The ""brittle"" definition is probably imitative, the word sounding like its meaning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2349,"<ul><li>Discord is the strife and tension that arises when two sides disagree on something, like the high-pitched screaming of two kids fighting over the front seat of the car.</li><li>Discord can be broken down into the prefix dis, meaning ""different,"" and cord, which stems from an old word for ""heart."" So that leaves us with ""different hearts."" So if we're talking about music, discord means a lack of harmony — tones that clash so badly your ears bleed. But when there's discord between people, their hearts are in different places — which usually results in more than a few raised voices clashing disharmoniously.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2350,"<ul><li>Generate means produce or create. A good stock pick might generate cash, and a good idea might generate the basis for an Oscar-winning film.</li><li>Generate and the closely related word generation both come from the Latin word genus, which means ""stock or race."" Its root, in turn, is the Proto-Indo-European gen-, ""to produce, give birth, or beget."" Let's say you have two siblings. In that case, your parents' marriage has generated three children. In a hydroelectric power plant, water generates power. And you can get a paper route or babysit if you're looking to generate a little income.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2351,"<ul><li>An item is one thing, usually in a group or a list. At a restaurant, you might find yourself interested in a particular item on the menu (until you notice the price and decide to order a hamburger instead).</li><li>Item is a Latin word meaning “likewise.” As early as the 15th century, this word was used in formal writing to introduce each point in a list (like a medieval version of the bullet point). The meaning of item has continued to evolve. Since the 1970s, it’s been used in casual speech to refer to a romantically involved couple: ""Did you hear? Avery and Sam are an item!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2352,"<ul><li>To interchange two things is to trade or switch them. If the painting hanging on your wall just doesn't fit the room, you can interchange it with the photograph on the opposite wall.</li><li>When you're baking a pie, you can usually interchange one kind of fruit for another, or interchange tapioca for cornstarch to thicken the filling. When interchange is a noun, it has various meanings including ""highway intersection,"" or the place where these busy roads meet each other. This road meaning dates only from the 1940s, while the ""change places"" meaning is at least 400 years old.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2353,"<ul><li>Multicultural things are made up of or include more than one ethnic group or culture. Your multicultural food fair might include dishes from Chile, Syria, Sudan, and France.</li><li>The world is multicultural, and societies in most countries are multicultural. We all need to learn about people whose religions, skin color, histories, and cultures are completely different from ours — you can get this from multicultural education, like a world history class that includes multicultural perspectives. When the word multicultural was first used in the mid-twentieth century, it often referred to Canada. Multi- means ""many,"" and cultural comes from the Latin cultura, ""cultivating.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2354,"<ul><li>If you make an omission, you leave something out. If you are a restaurant reviewer and you give a glowing review to a new restaurant but fail to mention that you own half of it, that's a significant omission.</li><li>The noun omission comes from the verb, omit, which means to leave out. Omissions can be purposeful or a result of neglect. Was the omission of Aunt Suzy from your wedding invitation something you meant to do, or an accident? If you're cleaning the house but don't take out the garbage, you'll regret your omission when the garbage is stinking up the kitchen.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2355,
4000EEW_B04_U28_2356,"<ul><li>If something pokes your hand, you will probably look at your hand to see if it pierced the skin. To pierce means to go right through, especially with something sharp.</li><li>Pierce has several meanings, but they all involve something sharp penetrating something else, like scissors through a plastic bag or a pen through a pocket. You can also pierce confusion by saying something that makes everything clear. Another meaning has to do with sound. Much like a knife, a sharp sound can pierce the silence and a loud, high shriek will pierce your ears.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2357,"<ul><li>To select something means to choose it from among others. If you select the most expensive phone, it doesn’t necessarily mean you will be happy with what you get.</li><li>You can use select as an adjective as well as a verb. It means ""specially chosen"" or ""of superior quality."" For instance, you might be one of the select few who know how to really appreciate a game of Tetris, or you might want to choose a wine from a select list of Spanish reds. All of this assumes that if you select one thing, you feel that it's better than all the other choices.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2358,"<ul><li>A structure is something of many parts that is put together. A structure can be a skyscraper, an outhouse, your body, or a sentence.</li><li>Structure is from the Latin word structura which means ""a fitting together, building."" Although it's certainly used to describe buildings, it can do more than that. A family's structure includes the relationship of its members, your body structure can refer to how your muscles and bones fit together. Sentence structure is how a sentence is put together, including subjects, verbs, and all that stuff English teachers love to yap about. Structure is usually a noun, but it can also be a verb meaning to impose order, like if you ""structure an argument to convince your parents to let you stay out later.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2359,"<ul><li>If you want to know the meaning of visual, just look around! Anything you can see falls under the heading of visual. What ""aural"" is to the ears and ""olfactory"" is to the nose, visual is to the eyes.</li><li>It's often said that ""film is a visual medium""; it uses pictures to tell a story. You have to see it to get it. That's clearly different from, say, radio which can only use audio. Have you ever closed your eyes while watching a cartoon? If you cut out the visual parts and just listen to the music and sound effects, it's often even funnier. As zany as the sounds are, they're even funnier when you separate them from their visual cues. Visual shares its root with vision, which is (not surprisingly) the ability to see. How visual!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U28_2360,"<ul><li>If something is wavy, it's either very slightly curly, like your sister's wavy hair, or it has a surface or edge that curves back and forth, like the wavy corrugated metal on a barn roof.</li><li>Anything wavy is in some way composed of waves, whether it's your dog's wavy coat or the wavy surface of Lake Michigan. The adjective can describe an undulating movement or a still, static shape: ""The wavy fries just taste better to me than the straight ones."" Both wave and wavy stem from the Old English wagian, ""to move to and fro.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2361,"<ul><li>Something that is transformed from one state or form to another has had a conversion. The twentieth century saw the conversion from outhouses to indoor plumbing. You may oversee the conversion of your attic into an extra bedroom.</li><li>The noun conversion can be used to describe some very specific transformations. If you exchange euros for dollars, you have made a monetary conversion. If your Canadian friend tells you, ""It was warm today! It got up to 28!"" and you figure out that 28 degrees in Celsius is the same as 82 degrees in Fahrenheit, then you have made a mathematical conversion. If you change your religion, you've had a religious conversion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2362,"<ul><li>To cram is to crowd or stuff people or things into a limited amount of space. You might be tempted to cram your mouth full of your mom's chocolate chip cookies, especially if they just came out of the oven and are still warm and gooey.</li><li>You can cram yourself with food, or cram your books onto a shelf that's not quite big enough to hold them. A writer might cram one book with dozens of characters, or you could cram homemade pancakes with blueberries. Another way to cram is to study for a test all in one session: ""I haven't studied at all yet — I'll have to stay up tonight and cram."" The Old English root, crammian, means ""stuff something into something else.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2363,"<ul><li>Defer means to put off or delay. You can try to defer the inevitable by pushing “snooze” and falling back asleep, but eventually you're going to have to get up.</li><li>If you're excellent at pushing things to a later date and a master at procrastination, then you already know how to defer. But defer can also mean to comply with another person’s opinion or wishes. So when your boss finds out you deferred your work to shop online instead, you should probably defer when she asks you to come in and finish everything up over the weekend.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2364,"<ul><li>To export something is to move it from its current location to a different territory.  Some have been trying to export the American diet overseas by spreading McDonald's fries around the globe.</li><li>The verb export comes from the Latin word exportare which means “to carry out” or “send away.”  To export something is to move it across borders. You could export locally made fabric to wealthy European cities. When something is an export, it is a good, service or idea that is sent or sold to a foreign land: diamonds are a valuable African export.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2365,"<ul><li>To fume is to feel or express great anger. You would fume if your teacher accused you of cheating when you didn't.</li><li>As a verb, fume is usually used figuratively to mean ""to feel very angry,"" whereas as a noun, it is used more as its Latin root fumus ""smoke, steam, vapor."" A strong-smelling gas, smoke or vapor is also called a fume. In cartoons, when a character is fuming, it is often drawn with fumes coming out of its ears. You may fume about the inconsiderate person who sits in the car with the engine running, spewing clouds of exhaust fumes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2366,"<ul><li>If something is habitual, it's what you usually do. Your habitual jeans and t-shirt might work for school, but try dressing up for the opera.</li><li>Habitual is the adjective form of habit, which comes from the Latin habēre, which meant the mode of one's being, and often referred to the mode of dress. Now habit means anything you do repeatedly — your habitual actions. Perhaps you have a habitual preference for cheeseburgers, which you eat at your habitual restaurant on your habitual Wednesday night out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2367,"<ul><li>To justify is to make excuses for one's actions, like the dieter who has to justify the few tiny pieces of chocolate she's sneaked in between salads.</li><li>Anyone who has ever made excuses for his or her actions knows the meaning of justify, like the bank robber who justifies his latest heist by claiming he needs the bank's money to support his charitable foundation. He might think he's got a good reason for holding up the bank, but he's going to have a hard time convincing the bank's owner of his reason, or justification. To justify a line of text is to space it so that it lines up with the margin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2368,"<ul><li>Notwithstanding means ""in spite of something."" Your boasts about having memorized the entire textbook and bribing the teacher with apples notwithstanding, you still managed to fail the final exam with flying colors.</li><li>You don't have to look too closely at the word to be able to break it into three parts: not- + withstand (to successfully oppose or resist) + the participial ending -ing. In the most literal sense, notwithstanding actually means to successfully oppose or resist. Top-of-the-line wet-traction tires notwithstanding, the car still got stuck in the mud. Notwithstanding works just as well in a more figurative context. His reputation for charm and tact notwithstanding, he offended everyone in the room.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2369,"<ul><li>If your factory transforms steel into train wheels, your factory's output––what it produces––is train wheels. A country's output is the total quantity of goods it produces.</li><li>The word input is the opposite of output, but only in the sense of the process––if bananas, milk, and ice cream are the input, the output is a milkshake. But you don't usually talk about input in the aggregate, as something you measure over time for a factory, a company, or a country.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2370,"<ul><li>Overpopulation is what happens when there are too many members of a species. An overpopulation of deer can lead to more of them being hit by cars and more gardens being nibbled.</li><li>When the population of any group is too large for its environment to support, that's overpopulation. That can mean so many people inhabiting a region that there's not enough food for everyone, or an overabundance of rabbits in an area with no natural predators. An overpopulation of pets in the U.S. means that unwanted cats and dogs have to be euthanized every year; there are just too many of them for the number of available adopters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2371,"<ul><li>A patent is a government document that proves that an invention is yours and yours alone. In the U.S., as of 2009, over 7,000,000 patents were issued by the Patent and Trademark Office.</li><li>Patent also refers to leather that has a very shiny finish. The process for making leather look like this was once patented, but since patents do not last forever, the process is now available for anyone to use. As with patent leather, the word is often used as part of a sales pitch, explaining why something is special: ""We use patented technology..."" or ""Our patented method...""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2372,"<ul><li>When you penalize someone, you punish them. A traffic cop will usually penalize a speeder with an expensive ticket.</li><li>A court might penalize a criminal with fines or time in prison, while a frustrated teacher is more likely to penalize the class clown with detention. Sports referees frequently penalize players by allowing the opposing team an advantage of some sort, like a penalty kick in soccer or a free throw in basketball. Penalize is rooted in penal, or ""pertaining to punishment."" The Greek root is poine, ""penalty, punishment, or blood money.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2373,"<ul><li>Petroleum is oil — a fossil fuel that powers many vehicles and other machinery.</li><li>Petroleum is a fancy, technical word for something you've probably heard of: oil, an energy source. Petroleum is also known as crude, crude oil, fossil oil, and rock oil. A lot of petroleum is found in the Middle East, and people are always looking for new sources of petroleum. You have to drill for petroleum, because it's deep inside the Earth. There’s a limited amount of petroleum, so many people worry that we're going to use it all up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2374,"<ul><li>A region is an area. A region can be geographic — like a part of a country. A region can be intellectual — like a region of the mind. There are also bodily regions — like abdominal, thoracic, and posterior.</li><li>A region is any space that is distinct from another area. The word region is from the Latin regionem which means “direction, boundary, district.” When you go to California you may want to travel north to the wine region, which will stimulate the taste-receptor region of your brain. After that, if you go south to the filmmaking region of Hollywood, you will excite the “movie-and-entertainment” region of your mind.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2375,"<ul><li>A scrap is a little leftover bit of something. You might jot down notes on a scrap of paper, or you might toss a scrap of food to your happy dog.</li><li>A scrap is typically a small item that originally was part of something larger, like a scrap of fabric that was once part of a larger piece. Scrap can also describe something that’s no longer useful. For example, you might take scrap metal to the recycling center. A final meaning of the noun scrap is ""fight,"" as in ""I got into a scrap with my brother."" Scrap also has a verb form that means ""discard."" When you scrap your plan to move to the Bahamas, that means you’re abandoning the plan.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2376,"<ul><li>Sector sounds like section, doesn't it? That's a good way to remember that a sector is a specific part of society or the economy, made up of similar elements — like the health care sector or the education sector.</li><li>Our most common use of the word sector refers to a society’s divisions. For example, our economy is divided into the private sector (privately-owned interests) and the public sector (government). Other than that, the word also has many technical applications in math and science. From the Latin verb secare, ""to cut,"" sector was applied long ago to math as a section of a circle, which carried through to military language as ""a circle around a headquarters.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2377,"<ul><li>If you subscribe to something, you sign up to receive it regularly. If you subscribe to the New York Times, it's delivered to your door every morning or you get online access.</li><li>When you subscribe to a belief, you adopt it as your own. You might subscribe to the notion that children should be seen and not heard, or you might wholeheartedly subscribe to your town's proposal to save the wetlands. A less common use of subscribe is to sign your name on something, reflecting the origin of the word, which comes from the Latin subscribere, ""to write below,"" that is, to sign at the bottom of a document.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2378,"<ul><li>When you subsist, you keep yourself alive. Since most airlines have stopped serving food, many travelers are forced to subsist on little packets of pretzels, even on long flights.</li><li>To subsist is to feed yourself, or keep yourself going, especially when you just barely manage to do so. A hunger striker might subsist on only water for weeks, and people in developing countries often have to subsist on small rations of rice  or grain. Subsist comes from the Latin word subsistere, ""to stand firm,"" but sometimes subsisting makes people feel like they are barely standing, rather than firmly standing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2379,"<ul><li>You can use the verb suspend any time you need to stop something. Whether it’s your judgment, a rule, or bus service, when you suspend it, you temporarily bring it to a halt.</li><li>Suspend often describes stopping an activity for a while. A winter storm, for example, may suspend air travel until weather conditions improve. Suspend also works in a more figurative sense, such as when you suspend your doubt in order to give someone or something a fair chance. A student who is suspended is temporarily forbidden from attending class. Don't confuse this with expel, which means he or she may never return.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U29_2380,"<ul><li>Synthesis is the act of combining elements to form something new. If you describe your bedroom decor as a synthesis of vintage and punk, we'll know you mean a mixture of these two styles.</li><li>Synthesis can be either concrete or abstract. Scientists use the word to talk about what happens when chemicals combine — think of photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize light, carbon dioxide, and water to produce food. If you write a screenplay titled Batman Saves Jane Eyre, then that's synthesis as well (though you may have trouble selling it). Synthesis can also refer to the act of combining ideas.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2381,"<ul><li>An acrobat is someone who skillfully performs gymnastic feats or other actions that involve agility and balance, such as a trapeze artist soaring through the air, or a tightrope walker at the circus.</li><li>You may be tempted to conclude that the bat in acrobat is a tribute to the animal that soars through the air when not hanging upside down. The source is not quite that creative. It comes from bainein, which is Greek for ""to walk."" The acro bit comes from akros, meaning ""highest point."" So acrobat is a reference to the classic and possibly first trick perfected by these artists, tightrope walking.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2382,"<ul><li>When you give your active support to an idea or cause, you are showing your advocacy for that cause. Your advocacy for an animal rights group might help raise money to save stray pups.</li><li>The noun advocacy comes to English from a term used in Roman law. An advocate was a professional whose job was to plead cases in front of a court of law. That meaning led to the verb form advocate, as well as advocacy, to describe the work of an advocate. ""The lunchroom staff were advocates for healthier school lunches; their advocacy was supported by parents and the school board; however, the students were reluctant to give up their cookies and chips.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2383,"<ul><li>Communal and community both come from Latin communis ""common, of the community""—if a pool is communal, it can be used by the members of the community that owns it.</li><li>A communal well in a town without plumbing is a great idea. Until it runs dry, everyone can take responsibility for caring for their water source. A communal drinking cup is not such a great idea—accompanied as it is by possible infection.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2384,"<ul><li>Something that is unstable or subject to change can be described as fluid. The fluid political situation in a particular country makes it unsafe to travel there, with the constant possibility of a violent uprising.</li><li>A liquid is a fluid — something that flows easily when poured — although gases can also be called fluid. When your doctor told you to drink lots of fluids to help your cold symptoms, she probably meant things like water or orange juice, not root beer floats. If a movement is smooth, it can also be described as fluid. You have to make fluid arm movements in ballet so you look graceful.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2385,"<ul><li>When you harmonize different opinions or ideas, you bring them to some kind of agreement. It's challenging to harmonize the different interests of a whole classroom full of children, but that's part of what a good teacher does.</li><li>When senators from different parties work together on a bill, they need to harmonize their different expectations and and priorities before they can come up with a good compromise. Another way to harmonize is to blend two singing voices or two instruments in a way that sounds pleasing. This is the oldest meaning of the word, which ultimately comes from the Greek harmonia, ""concord of sounds"" or ""agreement.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2386,"<ul><li>If someone comments that you are very industrious, they are complimenting you for working hard and tirelessly. You can have the evening to yourself if you're industrious enough during the afternoon to get your homework and chores done.</li><li>The word industrious is closely related to the word industry, used for both the quality of being hardworking, “He is a model of industry,” as well as a field of business, ""the construction industry."" It might help to remember the Industrial Revolution, the time when machinery was introduced to the manufacturing world. If you're industrious, you work as hard as machines do!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2387,"<ul><li>To be inventive is to be creative. Inventive people are good at using their imaginations.</li><li>If you know that inventors create new things, then it makes sense that the word inventive applies to people and behavior that show creativity. Artists are inventive, especially if their work is different than other people's work. Little kids are very inventive: their imaginations have almost no limits. People who copy others aren't inventive, because they're not being original. When people are being inventive, new ideas are flowing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2388,"<ul><li>Use the noun mandarin when you're talking about a powerful member of a government, company, or cultural group. In other words, don't mess with the mandarin.</li><li>You can use mandarin to mean ""bureaucrat,"" or an official who tends to make things complicated and who wields a lot of power. Another kind of mandarin is a respected cultural or academic figure: ""My favorite philosophy professor is considered a mandarin on campus."" Mandarin with a capital ""M"" refers to the language spoken in China. Originally, this word meant simply ""Chinese official,"" from the Hindi root word mantrī, ""counselor.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2389,"<ul><li>The adjective metropolitan describes something that's characteristic of a city. You really enjoy metropolitan life — there's always something happening, and you can walk or take the subway anywhere you want to go.</li><li>The word metropolitan comes from metropolis, which in Greek means mother city, made up of mētēr meaning mother, and polis meaning city. A person who lives in a metropolis, or city, is also called a metropolitan. You may have loved cities even when you were growing up in the suburbs, looking forward to the day you could become a true metropolitan in the biggest city you could find.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2390,"<ul><li>A mimic is someone who is good at imitating others. A gifted mimic might be able to imitate one president after another just by minimally changing facial expression and manner of speaking.</li><li>Mimic, related to mime (""an entertainer who performs using gestures not speech""), can be traced back to the Greek mimeisthai, ""to imitate."" Usually when you mimic someone, you imitate them in order to make fun of them. Performers mimic famous people to get laughs, but ordinary people mimic others when they are angry at them. Who hasn't mimicked parents or a boss who has said no one too many times?!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2391,"<ul><li>A misguided decision is one that's made without good judgment and careful thought. It would be misguided to think you could write your entire term paper in one night, or to climb into the polar bear exhibit at the zoo for a better look at them.</li><li>Misguided is a polite way to say ""a really dumb decision or belief."" Your choice to go swimming in the ocean during a hurricane would definitely be considered misguided, and so would your decision to join the mountain climbing team if you are afraid of heights. Both are examples of unwise choices made after not enough deliberation. Misguided uses the prefix mis-, ""bad or wrong,"" and guided, or ""directed.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2392,"<ul><li>When you rehearse, you practice something. You and your cast mates will need to rehearse for several weeks before you'll be ready to perform the entire two hours and forty-five minutes of the musical ""Hamilton.""</li><li>A new teacher might rehearse before his first day teaching math to ninth graders, and you'll want to rehearse before you sing the national anthem on the field before a baseball game begins. If you're nervous about something, like asking someone to the prom, you might rehearse it in your mind. At the root of rehearse is the Old French word rehercier, which means both ""go over again,"" and ""rake and turn over the soil.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2393,"<ul><li>If you are interviewing employees for your new pet store, you may want to ask if they are resourceful. If they are, it means they are good at problem solving, and this could come in very handy.</li><li>Think of resourceful people as “full of resources,” or tools for coming up with solutions. They adapt well to new or difficult situations and they are able to think creatively. For example, if a snake gets loose in the pet store, a resourceful person will be able to figure out how to lure it back into its cage again.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2394,"<ul><li>Scorn is open disrespect for someone or something. It can also be disrespect coupled with feelings of intense dislike.</li><li>The noun scorn describes your feelings of disdain when you encounter something you view as worthless or inferior — like, for instance, a talk show that gets all its facts wrong. Use the verb form for those times when you’re actively expressing scorn. You might scorn a politician who spends $100,000 on travel while claiming to work hard promoting middle-class values.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2395,"<ul><li>The adjective sensory describes something relating to sensation — something that you feel with your physical senses. Sticking a knife into a toaster will give you a sensory experience, but so will smelling a rose. Stick with the rose.</li><li>Sensory comes from the Latin word sentire, meaning ""to perceive, feel."" Sampling your mom's blueberry pie is a sensory experience — you can smell it, you can taste it, and the crust has a really good texture. You may get sensory overload when you're in New York City because there's so much for your senses to take in. Sensory can also describe a nerve fiber, such as a sensory neuron, that carries impulses to the nerve centers in your body.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2396,"<ul><li>A statute is a formal law or rule. Whether it's enacted by a government, company, or other organization, a statute is typically written down.</li><li>Local governments can pass all kinds of statutes, or written laws, to govern their citizens. A city's government might try to restrict the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public, or make it illegal to pet cats on the weekends. Of course, silly statutes like no cat-petting on weekends can be pretty hard to pass.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2397,"<ul><li>Technical describes a specific art or science, or training for a particular job. If you have trouble with your new computer, you might call for technical support, but a technical school teaches you a certain craft, like how to weld.</li><li>Technical comes from the Greek tekhno, which means ""art or skill."" Anything technical requires both art and skill. If you're an Olympic gymnast, you have technical abilities. You might go to a technical school to learn how to be a chef, a mechanic, or a massage therapist. While being technical can be a positive trait, you don't want to overwhelm someone with technicalities. For example: If you're trying to explain how a car works to a kid and you start talking about manifolds, you're getting too technical.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2398,"<ul><li>Veteran commonly refers to someone who has fought in a war––think Veterans' Day, the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial––but, in fact, the word can mean anyone with experience in a particular field.</li><li>Many veterans of World War II went to college afterward, through the G.I. Bill, and pursued professional careers. At the end of those careers, it was not unusual to find among the ranks of veteran teachers or veteran attorneys or veteran doctors men who were also veterans of the war.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2399,"<ul><li>A villain is a bad person — real or made up. In books, movies, current events, or history, the villain is the character who does mean, evil things on purpose.</li><li>Today a villain is a wicked person, whether in fact or fiction. In the 1300s, villain described a low-born rustic. It came from the Medieval Latin word villanus, or farmhand. Just why a word would evolve from meaning farmer into evildoer is a little mysterious, although it probably has to do with farmers not being chivalrous, like the knights who were so admired in those days.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B04_U30_2400,"<ul><li>A vine is a plant that spreads by creeping along the ground or climbing up some kind of support. Grapes are one example of a vine, and ivy is another.</li><li>The famous children's book Madeline takes place ""in an old house in Paris that was covered with vines."" Vines naturally trail along or climb trees, fences, and houses. The root of vine means ""wine,"" and the original definition was ""plant bearing grapes for making wine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2401,"<ul><li>Aroma is the word for a fragrant scent, one that pleases the nose in a way that makes you lick your lips.  Unlike its foul-smelling cousin the odor, an aroma smells but never stinks.</li><li>Want to know what aromas smell like?  Brew a fresh pot of coffee, grill some onions, and fry up a few strips of bacon. Aromas make you drool. You can also use the word to describe things that don't literally smell, yet somehow seem to linger smell-like in the air, like the oppressive aroma of a brutal dictatorship.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2402,"<ul><li>A beverage is any type of drink. It's something you might offer a guest in your house; it's also the favorite moniker of companies that manufacture both soda and juice — they call themselves beverage companies.</li><li>One of the most popular beverages in history is Coca-Cola, developed in 1886. Initially, Coke was called a brain tonic for intellectuals. Ingredients of the original recipe included coca leaves and cola nuts, and until 1909 contained small amounts of cocaine. Today, the Coca Cola company markets hundreds of beverages including soft drinks, juices, and sports drinks.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2403,"<ul><li>A cluster is a small group of people or things. When you and your friends huddle awkwardly around the snack table at a party, whispering and trying to muster enough nerve to hit the dance floor, you’ve formed a cluster.</li><li>Cluster comes to us from the Old English word clyster, meaning bunch. Nowadays, you can use cluster as either a noun or a verb. When we were kids, we would stand in a cluster (noun) on the street corner, eagerly awaiting the appearance of the Good Humor truck every afternoon. Then we would cluster (verb) eagerly around the driver, demanding ice cream. Virtually anything can form a cluster — flowers, cells, stars, human beings, and even events.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2404,"<ul><li>When you put things together, you combine them, creating one out of several. In some cases, the different items blend their properties and cannot be divided again, while in other cases the combined  items can be picked out separately.</li><li>In Latin, the prefix com- means ""together,"" and bīnī means ""two by two."" These were combined to create the word combīnāre, or ""to unite."" Comedian Dave Attell offers a good use of the verb combine (cum-BINE): What're the two things they tell you are healthiest to eat? Chicken and fish. You know what you should do? Combine them, eat a penguin. Hiram Moore's combine (the noun is pronounced COM-bine) was a machine that combined reaping, binding, and threshing into one machine, saving farmers a lot of work.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B05_U01_2406,"<ul><li>Things that are contemporary are either happening at the same time or happening now. Contemporary art is recent art.</li><li>In history class, if you hear that one famous person was a contemporary of another, that means they lived at the same time. Contemporaries are people and things from the same time period. Contemporary can also describe things happening now or recently. It's common to speak of contemporary music or contemporary furniture, for example. Those things are new, not old. Anything characteristic of the present day can be called contemporary.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2407,"<ul><li>To cultivate is to nurture and help grow. Farmers cultivate crops, fundraising professionals cultivate donors, and celebrities cultivate their images.</li><li>When you cultivate something, you work to make it better. Originally, the word referred only to crops that required tilling, but the meaning has widened. No matter what is being cultivated, the word implies a level of care that is reminiscent of gardening. Sometimes friendships come naturally and sometimes you have to cultivate them. To cultivate anything requires an attention to detail, an understanding of what is being cultivated, and a lot of patience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2408,"<ul><li>""To err is human, to forgive divine"" means that everyone makes mistakes, but we should try to be like god and forgive one another. Divine basically means relating to, coming from, or like God or a god.</li><li>Divine also has an old-fashioned and informal meaning of being very good or pleasing, as in ""She looked absolutely divine in her blue and white gown."" This is an adjective that goes back to Middle English, borrowed from Old French devine, from Latin dīvīnus ""divine, foreseeing,"" from dīvus ""god.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2409,"<ul><li>When there is a lot of moisture in the air, it is humid out. The air in a rain forest is humid, the air in a desert is dry.</li><li>People like to say that it's not the heat that bothers them, it's the humidity. They say this because when it is humid, or when there is a lot of water in the air, the heat feels hotter. It also makes wavy hair frizzy and straight hair limp. Air that is cold and moist is called damp, so when people talk about humid air, think tropical, as that's usually how the word is meant.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2410,"<ul><li>An odor is anything you can smell — like a scent or an aroma. If you sniff a sour odor in your gallon of milk, you should probably pour it down the sink instead of drinking it.</li><li>Most people are more likely to use the word odor for unpleasant smells, like the odor of your uncle's stinky cigars or the musty odor in your grandmother's attic. You can also use the word odor in a figurative way, to mean a feeling or impression given by something: ""The whole bank seemed full of the odor of money and greed."" Odor is Latin, meaning ""a smell or a scent.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2411,"<ul><li>Touch your tongue to the top of your mouth. What you're touching is your palate. Palate is often used when discussing taste in a broader sense, as in: chocolate cake is pleasing to the palate.</li><li>A person with an expensive palate likes only high-priced culinary treats. Someone who tastes slight nuances in food is said to have a well-developed palate, and someone who likes only fancy food is said to have a sophisticated palate. In reality, most taste receptors are on the tongue. But that doesn't sound sophisticated at all, does it?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2412,"<ul><li>In some religions, paradise is considered the ultimate destination, but in general, it's any place that is ideal and free from worry. Eden, Shangri-la, or even the corner nail salon — each might represent paradise to someone.</li><li>Paradise comes from the Greek paradeisos meaning ""park, paradise, Garden of Eden."" The Garden of Eden was a paradise free from all worries until Eve ate the apple that broke the dream.  Often when you see advertisements for tourism in the Caribbean, a sense of paradise is evoked by the beautiful images and carefree descriptions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2413,"<ul><li>A plantation is a large agricultural property dedicated to planting a few crops on a large scale. If you dream of having 3,000 acres to raise cucumbers on, then you have dreams of a cucumber plantation.</li><li>Plantation doesn't have to only mean massive single-product farms. A small grove of trees is also called a plantation, but usually when we use the word we mean the big farms. In the United States prior to the Civil War, crops like cotton and tobacco were grown on plantations in the South by exploiting the labor of enslaved people. In Latin America, many international companies own banana and coffee plantations.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2414,"<ul><li>Rapid means happening with great speed or in a brief period of time. Think of Rapid Eye Movement (REM sleep), when your eyes are darting back and forth quickly — trying to follow your fast-paced dreams.</li><li>Rapid comes from the Latin word rapere, which means ""to hurry away"" or ""to seize."" If you are first to raise your hand in class with the correct answer, your teacher will be pleased with your rapid response. Your pulse may be rapid after you run a quick sprint, and after a rapid run-up in the stock market you may decide to sell some shares and lock in the profit.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2415,"<ul><li>When you pay a high rate, you pay a lot of money.  When you move at a high rate of speed, you go fast.  If you are a judge at a contest, you rate the contestants.</li><li>It's interesting how one word can have different origins for different meanings. For example, the noun rate, referring to amounts comes from the Latin rata, “a fixed amount.” But the verb rate seems to come from the Scandinavian rata, ""to reject.""  If the person you are dating asks you to rate them against your previous partners, you might change the subject at a high rate of speed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2416,"<ul><li>Something soothing is comforting; it helps calm fears, anxiety, or pain. Cool aloe vera lotion is very soothing on a really bad sunburn, while pacifiers are soothing to screaming babies.</li><li>The adjective soothing comes to us from the verb soothe, which means ""to relieve."" So something soothing brings relief and makes you feel better. Soothing music can help you feel more relaxed, while a soothing cup of hot chocolate can warm you up from the frigid cold. And if you fall and scrape your knee? You'll probably wish your mom was there to offer some soothing words and a kiss to make it all better.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2417,"<ul><li>Something that is subtle is not obvious: a professional food taster might be able to perceive subtle differences of flavor that most people don't notice.</li><li>Subtle is used for things that are hard to describe because of their complexity or delicacy: a way of thinking, arguing, or creating a work of art.  The word is pronounced like ""suttle"" and it was originally spelled that way when it was borrowed from Old French, but the b got imported to make the word look more like its ultimate source, the Latin adjective subtilis. If you try to pronounce the b, your ignorance of how to say the word properly won't be very subtle!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2418,"<ul><li>Texture is the physical feel of something — smooth, rough, fuzzy, slimy, and lots of textures something in between.</li><li>Sandpaper is very rough — it has a gritty, rough texture. Other things, like linoleum, have a smooth texture. Texture has to do with how an object feels and it's ingredients. Texture is very important in clothes: a cotton shirt has a different texture than a polyester shirt. You can also talk about other kinds of texture, like musical texture. A symphony and a rock song have different instruments, so they have different textures.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2419,"<ul><li>Danger! Hazardous! Do not eat! These are just some of the warnings you'll see on toxic substances — meaning stuff that's poisonous and even deadly.</li><li>Cobra bites, wild mystery mushrooms and strong chemicals are all toxic. So are certain people, if they have particularly mean personalities. Toxic is related to the word toxin, which is a kind of poison. It comes from the ancient Greek word toxikon, which means ""poison for arrows."" Some toxic arrows could come in handy for those toxic personalities...</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U01_2420,"<ul><li>If you're tired of the same old breakfast of bran flakes and orange juice, vary your routine—put some banana slices on those bran flakes. You can vary the routine by changing the details but keeping the basics the same.</li><li>Use the verb vary when you're talking about changing up your usual routine. If your schedule changes at work, you might have to vary your sleep habits. A good dye job will vary the tints a little to look more natural. The ambiance at Olive Garden varies from restaurant to restaurant, but the unlimited breadsticks are always delicious. You'll probably recognize the root vari, which shows up in other words with similar meanings, like various, variable, and even variegated.</li></ul>"

In the navy, admiral is one of the highest ranks.</li><li>The military is full of rankings, such as captain, private, major, and corporal. Another is admiral, a ranking specific to the navy. While a captain is in charge of one ship, an admiral leads more than one ship: a bunch of ships, which are called a fleet. There are also a few different types of admirals, such as full admiral and vice admiral. Similarly, Battlestar Galactica’s Commander Adama becomes Admiral Adama as a result of leading more than one ship.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U02_2422,"<ul><li>An arc is a curve. You can describe the bend of a rainbow as an arc.</li><li>In math, an arc is one section of a circle, but in life you can use the word to mean any curved shape, like the arc of a ballerina's arm or the graceful arc of a flowering vine over a trellis. In the 14th century, arc first meant the movement of the sun in the sky, from the Old French arc, ""bow or arch,"" and the Latin root arcus, also ""bow or arch.""</li></ul>"

The line illustrates three different senses of the word, which can mean ""moral strength or reputation"" (what Raquel lacks), ""a person in a work of fiction"" (what The Wolf and Raquel literally are), or, by extension, ""a colorful personality"" (what Raquel has). A fourth usage is ""the distinctive nature of a person or thing,"" a meaning reflected in the word's origins. In Greek, a kharaktēr was a stamping tool, used to give something a distinctive mark.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U02_2424,"<ul><li>A conscience is a built-in sense of what's right and what's wrong. That sick feeling in your stomach after you lied to your brother about borrowing his skateboard? That might be your conscience bothering you.</li><li>The word conscience contains the word science, which comes from the Latin word scientia, meaning ""to know"" or ""knowledge."" You can think of your conscience as your knowledge of yourself, especially when it comes to your own morals, or your feelings about right and wrong. Pangs of conscience, which feel like an uncomfortable inner voice, are helpful when you're trying to decide the right thing to do in a particular situation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U02_2425,"<ul><li>To escape is to break free, to get out of a situation you don’t want to be in. It’s also a noun, as in an escape from a dull party that might involve a ladder and an upstairs window.</li><li>It’s hard to pin down the word escape. An escape can be the act of escaping, like an escape from prison, but an escape can also be a calming retreat, like a vacation that gets you away from the stress of everyday life. As a verb, escape also means, ""to fail to experience or know.” If the humor escapes you, you don't find the joke funny.</li></ul>"

Fiery can describe a literal blaze, a hot chili pepper, or even a fiery temper.</li><li>Any time there's fire, you have a fiery situation. This word applies to a lot more than flames, though. If you lose your temper easily, you may be called hot-headed or fiery. An intense argument — with two people yelling and carrying on — could be called fiery. Any kind of intense emotion or passion is fiery. If you're a cool customer, you're not very fiery. Also, you could say that hot Indian curry or spicy chicken wings are fiery.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U02_2427,"<ul><li>Flesh is the part of a body that's made of muscles and fat. If you grab the flesh of your little brother's arm to keep him from running into the street, you're holding the soft part of his arm.</li><li>We often use the word flesh to talk about the tissues of an animal's body — in other words, the fat and muscle that most humans consider to be food, or meat. But you'll also hear people say ""flesh and bone"" or ""flesh and blood"" when they're describing the physical parts of a human. The Old English root is flæsc, ""flesh or meat.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U02_2428,"<ul><li>A grapefruit is a large citrus fruit that grows on a tree. Ripe grapefruits are very slightly sour, juicy, and delicious.</li><li>The first grapefruits were an accident — they came from an inadvertent cross between an orange and a pomelo. Both of those species are native to Asia, but the grapefruit's accidental invention happened in Barbados some time in the 18th century. The name comes from the way the fruit clusters on the tree, close together like grapes, rather than its taste, which is a mixture of sweetness and acidity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U02_2429,"<ul><li>Hay is a type of dried grass that's fed to certain farm animals. You might buy bags of hay to feed your pet rabbit, who likes to nibble on it.</li><li>Hay is a mixture of grassy plants grown in fields, cut or mown, bundled in bales, and stored until ready to be fed to livestock. Hay and straw aren't the same thing; hay is cut when it's green, while straw is made up of the leftover dried stems and leaves of plants that have been harvested. And while some animals feed on straw too, hay is more nutritious. The Old English root is heg, ""grass cut or mown.""</li></ul>"

If you go camping, you might heat up some chili over a portable kerosene stove before telling ghost stories.</li><li>Kerosene is an efficient fuel, which makes it portable — you don't need to burn that much kerosene to generate heat or cook food. It's common, therefore, in camping stoves and lamps, and it's a low-cost method of backup heat during power outages as well. Also known as paraffin, kerosene has other uses, including powering jet engines, the outboard motors of small boats, and in parts of Asia, motorcycles as well.</li></ul>"

To start knitting, you need to put a loop of yarn on the end of one of your needles.</li><li>Loops are ovals or circles and are often made from rope or other fibers, like the loop at the end of a cowboy's lasso. The verb loop means to form the shape of a loop in the sky; or to make a loop from string or some other material. If something ""throws you for a loop,"" it catches you by surprise, and if you're ""in the loop,"" you have access to information that others might not have.</li></ul>"

Middle also means ""belly"" or ""abdomen,"" as in the middle part of a body, or ""between an earlier and later time."" Your middle name is usually the second of three names.

The word can also be used to describe items with a similar look, such as a paddle used in table tennis or certain kinds of video games.

4000EEW_B05_U02_2435,"<ul><li>If something is sour, it has a tangy or sharp flavor, like a lemon. Your brother may love the taste of limes, while they're way too sour for you.</li><li>Sometimes this adjective is used to describe a fermented odor (the way milk smells when it goes bad), or a wrong note in music, or even a terrible mood: ""Mom was acting so sour that I didn't even ask her if we could have pizza for dinner."" Sour comes from the Old English sur, ""sour, tart, or fermented.""</li></ul>"

Eventually the bets themselves became known as stakes.  Today, you can use the word as a verb to describe any risky endeavor — for example, ""Geoffrey staked his sandwich-making reputation on a six-foot hero with salami and pickles.""  A stake can also be an investment.  If you say that ""Bill has a stake in the business,"" it means he’s a part-owner.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U02_2437,"<ul><li>A steward is someone who takes care of the grounds or animals of a particular place. If your parents are always traveling and you have to take care of your six younger siblings, you probably feel like the steward of the house.</li><li>You might have heard the term ""stewardess,"" a female flight attendant, but the name has trickled out of use in favor of the gender-neutral ""flight attendant."" A steward is the male version of that. Anyone who takes care of places or people is a steward. You can be a steward of artifacts from an architectural dig. You can also be elected to be the steward of your co-workers retirement fund. Either way, someone's trusting you with their stuff.</li></ul>"

You can tie on a Halloween mask with a string, or weave a friendship bracelet with a bunch of colorful strings.</li><li>Strings are useful for tying up packages and cinching the waist of your sweatpants. You can also have a figurative string, a series or sequence: ""Our team had a string of wins."" As a verb, string means ""attach together"" or ""thread onto a string.""

Roses are famous for having the sweetest fragrance and the sharpest thorns.</li><li>Literal thorns, found on bushes and other plants, serve to protect plants from animals that might like to eat them. A ""thorn in one's side"" is an annoyance or problem: ""My neighbors are a thorn in my side, with their constant loud music and crazy parties!"" The source of this figurative definition is the Bible's ""thorn in the flesh.""</li></ul>"

Your car might be a wreck after you hit a telephone pole.</li><li>Your house might be a wreck after a visit from 3-year-old twins. You might be an emotional wreck after a fight with your boyfriend. A sunken ship is a wreck, or a shipwreck. When you hit that telephone pole, you’ve had a wreck, and you can also call your mangled car a wreck. When you’re next heading out with the car keys, you mom might say, ""Don't wreck the car!,” hoping you’ll bring it back in one piece.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2441,"<ul><li>To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, admonish him.</li><li>Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere, ""to advise, remind,"" admonish is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means ""scold"" or ""rebuke"" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are closer synonyms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2442,"<ul><li>Something audible can be heard. Sometimes things that people don't want others to hear become audible, such as a growling stomach during a quiet moment at the movies.</li><li>Coming from the Latin audīre, ""to hear,"" audible is an adjective meaning ""heard"" or ""hearable."" A scream is audible, a barking dog next door is audible, and a siren is audible. Why do some writers use the expression ""a barely audible whisper?"" Isn’t that what a whisper is — something you can barely hear?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2443,"<ul><li>An awesome something or someone is amazing, breathtaking, or overwhelming. Like traveling the globe in a hot air balloon or visiting the Taj Mahal. Or, if you're 7, hearing someone burp the alphabet.</li><li>Awesome popped on the scene around 1600, probably in a church. It first meant “profoundly reverential,” but morphed later into an adjective meaning “inspiring awe.” Flash forward to the 20th century, when awesome transformed once again — this time into an everyday word for ""impressive."" These days it's synonymous with ""outstanding"" and ""totally cool.""</li></ul>"

The riskier the situation, the more you need to beware.</li><li>A ""Beware of the dog"" sign means there's a dog in the house who doesn't care for visitors or new people. When you beware, you become very cautious. You look both ways and use extreme caution. This word can be remembered if you break it into two parts: to beware is the same as ""to be wary."" When you're wary, you're concerned and careful. People in dangerous jobs like the police and fire department need to beware every day.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2445,"<ul><li>When you're bragging, you're boasting. If you can't stop talking about your fancy new shoes, that's bragging.</li><li>Ever notice how some people are full of themselves and constantly telling you about the great things they've done? Those folks like to brag. Bragging is a verbal kind of showing off. We all do it sometimes, and it's almost always annoying when other people do it. A specific boast can be called a brag. Athletes often brag before big games. But only the winners can brag after, because they backed up their words.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2446,"<ul><li>Conscious is an adjective that simply means alert and awake. If you fall from a tree and smack your head on the side of the wheelbarrow, there's a good chance you won't be conscious afterward.</li><li>Conscious is a Latin word whose original meaning was “knowing"" or ""aware.” So a conscious person has an awareness of her environment and her own existence and thoughts. If you're ""self-conscious,"" you're overly aware and even embarrassed by how you think you look or act. But that sounds better than being unconscious, or totally unaware and out of it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2447,"<ul><li>When two people disagree, they have completely different opinions about something. You might disagree with your sister about whether chocolate or vanilla ice cream is the most delicious.</li><li>Use the verb disagree to talk about what happens when you have a conflict or a difference of thought about something with another person. People disagree about politics, food, sports, and movies — there is no subject that won't cause most people to find a way to disagree. The word comes from combining the Old French agreer, ""to receive with favor or take pleasure in"" with the Latin prefix dis, which here means ""do the opposite of.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2448,"<ul><li>An echo is a repetition or imitation of sound.  When sound waves hit a hard surface they might reflect, making the sound bounce and repeat.  If you agree with someone, you might echo his or her statement.</li><li>Poet Don Marquis said, “Writing a book of poetry is like dropping a rose petal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo.” The word echo came from the Greek word for ""sound."" In Greek mythology, Echo was a nymph who could only repeat the last words of others.  You were frightened when you thought someone was following you, until you realized you were only hearing the echo of your own footsteps.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2449,"<ul><li>The adjective eventual is used to describe something that is likely to happen in the indefinite future. If you are a teen, you can't wait for your eventual graduation from high school, but later, you'll look back fondly on those same high school days.</li><li>Eventual implies that the result will occur due to circumstances already set in motion or if a given set of circumstances happens. In other words, eventual is not used to randomly predict the future. You may hope to win the lottery in the future, but you can't talk about your eventual lottery win because you have no way to guarantee your numbers will be chosen — unless you've figured out a way to rig the system. If you have, maybe you should think about your eventual jail time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2450,"<ul><li>A hint is a slight indication or clue. Your mother might hint at the fact that she doesn’t like your shoes, while your grandmother will just come right out and say that they’re ugly.</li><li>If you’re a journalist following a lead, you’ll prefer that your source give you all the facts, rather than just a hint. A hint can be an indirect suggestion and it is also a very small amount — maybe you take just a hint of sugar in your coffee. As a verb, hint is an intimation or subtle suggestion. It’s also something you drop, like when you hint that you want a particular video game for your birthday.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2451,"<ul><li>An idiot is someone who does foolish things. If you take your little brother's dinosaur lunchbox to school instead of your own brown-bag lunch, you might feel like an idiot. But don't be too hard on yourself — we all make mistakes.</li><li>The word idiot originated in the 1300s, from the Old French word idiote, which meant ""person so mentally deficient as to be incapable of ordinary reasoning."" Today, though, idiot describes anyone who does foolish things, especially things that inconvenience others. If you put the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven but forget to turn it on, in four hours, you'll have a cold turkey and a bunch of relatives calling you an idiot.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2452,"<ul><li>Immense means very large in size, amount, or degree. You might describe the ocean as immense, or your homework load, or the slice of cake your brother took, leaving you a tiny sliver.</li><li>This word has an immense number of near synonyms: huge, great, enormous, vast, gigantic, colossal, mammoth, copious, tremendous are a few of the more common ones. If you're having immense difficulty deciding which word to use, just plain ""very big"" might do.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2453,"<ul><li>Something indirect is not hitting the target exactly. Indirect sunlight doesn't shine right on you — it reflects off a window or is muted by a shade.</li><li>If direct makes you think of a straight line, then indirect looks like a crooked one — there are turns and stops along the way. People who are sneaky might get what they want through indirect means, like going behind people's backs. If you go to school using side streets and back roads, that's an indirect path. Anything indirect is not taking the quickest or shortest route, but sometimes being indirect gets the job done.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2454,"<ul><li>An option is a possibility or choice. In football, a quarterback with three wide receivers has (at least) three throwing options.</li><li>An option is something that can be chosen — it's a possibility. Even something crazy — like jumping off a cliff — is always an option, just not a good one. There are lots of technical uses of option in business and legal writing. If you have the option on a house, you have the right to buy it. In sports, a free agent has the option of joining another team. No matter what you do, it's nice to have options. When we have no options, we feel trapped.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2455,"<ul><li>A pastime is any hobby or activity that you do to pass the time. Usually, people enjoy their pastimes.</li><li>When baseball was more popular, it was called the ""national pastime,"" because so many people enjoyed watching or playing it. Baseball is still a major pastime, as are many other sports. Other pastimes include listening to music, playing music, watching TV, playing video games, playing with your dog, and any kind of hobby. Whenever you're awake and not working, you're probably enjoying a pastime.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2456,"<ul><li>Something that is perfect is complete and without defect or blemish. It might also be precisely accurate or exact.</li><li>The word perfect can also be used as a verb meaning — you guessed it! — to make something perfect. (Note, though, the pronunciation difference: PER-fect as a noun; per-FECT as a verb.) It originally comes from the Latin word perficere, which breaks down into per- (""completely"") and facere (""do""). As a noun perfect is a grammatical term referring to a tense of verbs describing an action that has been completed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2457,"<ul><li>To pinpoint something is to nail down its exact location.</li><li>The point of a pin is very small and fine. Similarly, when you pinpoint something, you have narrowed down its location to the smallest possibility: you've found out exactly where it is. The government is constantly trying to pinpoint the location of terrorists, just as police try to pinpoint the location of criminals. Dogs can pinpoint many things through smell. It's often hard to pinpoint which car is producing an annoying car alarm. When you pinpoint something, you've found it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2458,"<ul><li>If you and your friend are seated separately on an airplane, you can always ask a stranger if they will switch seats with you. To switch is to change or exchange.</li><li>Switch can be a noun or verb, and in most cases it has the meaning of change. You can switch classes, political parties, or the radio station. Sometimes if you switch something with someone, they take yours and you take theirs — as in an exchange or trade. However, there is one unrelated and frightening meaning for the word. In the olden days, a form of punishment was to be hit with a thin, flexible, piece of wood called a switch.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2459,"<ul><li>Thorough describes something that is painstakingly complete, like a thorough search for your missing keys in which you look for them in coat pockets, under the table, in the refrigerator — in every single place you can think of.</li><li>Thorough rhymes with ""burrow"": ""THUR-oh."" It looks a lot like through but remember thorough is an adjective, so you might use it to describe a thorough investigation or a thorough review. In contrast through is used most often as a preposition — you might look through every drawer, for example, in a search — or as an adverb — you might see a hole in your pocket where coins fall through.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U03_2460,"<ul><li>By repeatedly trying to make someone miserable you torment them. The noun torment is the result of the verb torment.</li><li>After stealing the old lady's purse, you might expect to be tormented by many sleepless nights. Those nights without sleep will torment (tor-MENT) you. They are your torment (TOR-ment). Perhaps you shouldn't have done that.

You'll doubtless notice the relationship between torture and torment. But the subtle difference between them is that to torment someone is to torture them repeatedly. Often this is used metaphorically. For example, calling someone over and over to demand payment isn't actually torture, but it's certainly a way to torment them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2461,"<ul><li>An abrupt decision is one you make suddenly. An abrupt halt is one the Road Runner comes to when reaching an abrupt drop-off — you'd hear brakes squealing.</li><li>Because being abrupt with someone is often a way of showing them that you are angry, you often apologize for the appearance of it. ""I'm sorry I was abrupt. I was rushing to get to class."" The root of abrupt is Latin rumpere ""to break,"" which also gives us rupture ""break"" and interrupt ""break into.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2462,"<ul><li>The noun agony means acute pain — either mental or physical, but people often use the word hyperbolically: ""This paper cut is agony.""</li><li>The noun agony is also used in the common phrase ""the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat,"" which has been the tag-line of ABC's Wide World of Sports for decades. The catchphrase, in turn, is often rendered as a pun: ""He fell of the ladder and broke his foot. He writhed in agony from the pain, but the physical pain, was nothing compared to his mental agony when the doctor setting the bone joked, 'Now you know the agony of de feet!'""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2463,"<ul><li>An assassin is someone who murders an important political or religious leader. Brutus is one of the most infamous assassins in history. He murdered Julius Caesar, who ruled Rome in the first century B.C.</li><li>The word assassin, pronounced ""uh-SASS-in,"" describes a person who murders a prominent person, like a political or religious leader. Often, this person is hired to kill, though he or she might act on personal motivations. To correctly spell assassin, remember that it has two double s's.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2464,"<ul><li>A beard is the facial hair on a person's chin and cheeks. Santa Claus is famous in part for his long, white beard.</li><li>You're most likely to see a beard on an adult man, although some women grow enough facial hair to sport a beard too. Some animals, like goats, have beards as well. Someone whose presence helps another person disguise his identity — maybe because he's a spy — is often informally called a beard as well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2465,"<ul><li>A beast is an animal — and usually not a gentle or attractive one. You can also call a person a beast when they're behaving in a crude, savage, or horrible way.</li><li>There are many types of beast in the world: dogs, cats, horses, monkeys, birds, and fish are all beasts. Even tiny critters like bugs are beasts. A beast is basically any living thing, except for plants, because plants can't intentionally move. People can be called beasts too when they behave in a beastly way. A criminal is likely to be called a beast. So is a rude person. Anyone acting in an uncivilized or cruel way is being a beast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2466,"<ul><li>A chapel is a place of worship. It's usually smaller than a church, and it has its own altar.</li><li>A chapel is a small place of worship. Chapels are Christian and are often part of a larger institution, such as a hospital or prison. Universities often have a chapel. A chapel is a place people pray and find community, or even get married. The song “Chapel of Love” was a big hit in the 1960’s. In it, The Dixie Cups sing, “going to the chapel and I’m gonna get married….”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2467,"<ul><li>A person who analyzes and discusses topics in politics and sports is called a commentator. If you want to hear opinions on the news rather than the news itself, listen to commentators.</li><li>A reporter delivers the news and a commentator analyzes it, sometimes within the same news program. If you're a top sports commentator, you may become an even bigger household name than the players you are discussing, and you may pull in just as much money too. Political commentators, who often offer more opinion rather than analysis, are also sometimes called pundits or talking heads.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2468,"<ul><li>A con, or confidence game, is a swindle — when you take advantage of someone's trust.  If you con someone out of their life savings, you might wind up a con — as in convict.</li><li>The word con has many meanings, none of them good.  An argument has pros and cons, and the cons are always the downside. An ex-con is someone who spent time in jail as a convict, and a con artist is someone who scams people out of their money.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2469,"<ul><li>When there's a consensus, everyone agrees on something. If you're going to a movie with friends, you need to reach a consensus about which movie everyone wants to see.</li><li>Ever notice how people disagree about just about everything, from who's the best baseball player to how high taxes should be? Whenever there's disagreement, there's no consensus: consensus means everyone is on the same page. When you're talking about all the people in the world, it's hard to find a consensus on anything. There are just too many opinions. However, in a smaller group, reaching a consensus is possible.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2470,"<ul><li>A conspiracy is a secret agreement between two or more people to commit an unlawful or harmful act. A person who believes that the government is secretly controlled by power brokers, in flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution, is an example of a conspiracy theorist.</li><li>Conspiracy can also refer to the act of planning an unlawful or harmful act: Terrorists might be  accused of organizing a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Conspiracy is ultimately from Latin cōnspīrāre ""to agree or plot together, literally to breathe together."" The corresponding English verb is conspire.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2471,"<ul><li>A coup is a pretty major achievement, whether it involves taking over a government by force, or landing a major business contract.</li><li>When the word coup is used on the nightly news, it's usually describing a military government takeover. In the business section of the daily newspaper,  coup might refer to a big corporation landing an important contract or deal. However you use the word coup, don't say the ""p"" at the end. It's not pronounced like chicken coop. It sounds more like a dove's coo.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2472,"<ul><li>If you think public officials are nothing but a bunch of greedy buffoons, you have a cynical attitude about politics.</li><li>A cynical person has a bleak outlook about others, always imagining that people are ruled by their worst instincts. H.L. Mencken was famous for saying cynical things like, ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" The original Cynics were ancient Greek philosophers who never had a good word to say about anyone. The Greek word kynikos actually means ""canine,"" maybe because all of that sneering seemed a little dog-like.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2473,"<ul><li>A dome is a large hemispherical roof, like those seen on many capitol buildings. The Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem, is a Muslim shrine with a golden dome that sits on a holy rock.</li><li>In Italian, duomo is the word for church or cathedral; it comes from the Latin domus, ""house."" Many Italian cathedrals feature prominent domes, and eventually the word dome became synonymous with that particular architectural feature. An umbrella works because its dome shape sheds the rain efficiently.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2474,"<ul><li>The verb exclaim is from the Latin word exclamare, which means ""to cry out."" The English meaning is similar, to cry out, but with the added element of a strong emotion such as fear, joy, surprise.</li><li>In writing, when someone exclaims something, the punctuation mark used to express this vehement outcry is usually the exclamation point: ""Stop!"" you exclaim when your toddler climbs precariously on a chair stacked with books. ""Not in this lifetime!"" you cry out when your teenager wants to borrow the new car. You will exclaim ""I'm so proud!"" when your child graduates college.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2475,"<ul><li>A forum is a public discussion. It can refer to a meeting, a meeting house or any conversation that is available publicly.</li><li>There were forums — large public gathering places — in Ancient Rome; they can still be found across the globe. Traditionally, newspapers were thought of as forums for public discussions but more and more forums are virtual — discussion boards found online. Communities, however, still hold their own forums, or meetings, usually to discuss local issues. When you see the word forum, think public conversation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2476,"<ul><li>Glamour is the quality of being fascinating, alluring, or charming If you've watched Marilyn Monroe on a movie screen, then you've witnessed glamour!</li><li>The word glamour originally referred to a magical or even unreal charm or beauty attached to a person or an object. Today you can still glamour, or cast a spell over, someone, but you probably won’t. More often glamour is now used to mean a certain thrilling or attractive appeal -– especially sex appeal. Glamour is more than just good looks — the right clothing, jewelry, attitude, or friends can produce glamour — the mark of a star.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2477,"<ul><li>When you harass someone, you bother them to the point of exhaustion. It’s not that each attack is so severe, it’s the constant small attacks that wear someone out. If you harass your boss for a raise, you might end up getting fired instead!</li><li>Harass probably comes from the Old French word harer meaning ""to set a dog on."" Think of someone being hounded when you use this word. You can harass your parents with questions or requests, but in turn, they can also harass you to clean your room! While this is annoying, it's much worse if you are harassed in the sense of being verbally abused. The bully at school who harasses some poor kid will be subject to disciplinary action if a complaint is filed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2478,"<ul><li>To illuminate is to light up — with physical light or with an idea. A spotlight might illuminate an actor on stage, and a good chemistry teacher might illuminate students with a lesson on the atomic structure of hydrogen.</li><li>Originally, the verb illuminate referred to decorating handwritten manuscripts with bright lettering or pictures. Monks illuminated manuscripts with colors like gold, silver, bright red, and blue. Nowadays you can illuminate anything in the dark — either literally or figuratively. If you are afraid of the dark, illuminate your bedroom. In the dark when it comes to organic chemistry? Get an illuminating tutor.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2479,"<ul><li>To inflame is to make feelings stronger, or stir them up. Reminding your grandfather about the time his car was stolen may just inflame his anger.</li><li>Getting a parking ticket might inflame your frustration, and when a city imposes a curfew it may inflame the community's feelings of resentment. Another way to inflame is more literal: to cause a physical condition that involves swelling, pain, and redness. Scratching your poison ivy rash will only inflame it in the long run, even if it briefly brings relief. Inflame is from the Latin inflammare, ""set on fire"" and ""excite.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U04_2480,"<ul><li>In any musical composition, there is a dominant line that creates a tone pattern known as the piece's melody. There are specific rules for the musical composition of a melody, and most fall into regular patterns.</li><li>The ancient Greek word melōidía was used to denote a tune for lyric poetry. It was derived from melos, which meant ""song."" In most songs, the melody follows a logical, mathematical pattern that creates a memorable line of notes. The word suggests a beautiful and pleasant sound, as was celebrated in the 1946 Irving Berlin lyrics, ""A pretty girl is like a melody that haunts you night and day.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2481,"<ul><li>When you've been doing something awhile, you've been doing something for an indefinite amount of time: it could be a little while or a long while.</li><li>This is a word that's hard to figure out without context. Awhile always applies to time, but the amount of time can be small or large. You could say you've been waiting awhile in line at the bank: that might mean 15 minutes. On the other hand, if you haven't heard from a friend in months, you could say, ""Wow... It's been awhile!"" Like a bit or a load, you can't measure awhile.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2482,"<ul><li>Cyberspace is where online communication happens. If you've spent time chatting with friends on the Internet, you've been in cyberspace.</li><li>The official definition of cyberspace is fairly technical: ""the notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs."" Since it was coined in 1982 by science fiction writer William Gibson, it's become more popular to use cyberspace to mean ""online"" or ""on the Internet,"" especially when social interactions happen there. Cyberspace is the almost metaphorical place where two people, separately typing on their keyboards, meet and communicate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2483,"<ul><li>The verb edit means to prepare writing for publication by correcting, revising, or proofreading. If you write for a newspaper, someone very skilled will edit your work before the public sees it.</li><li>Edit can also mean to cut out. If you edit out all the references to Harry Potter from the famous series, you'll be left with much shorter books. Edit likely comes from the noun editor, meaning the person in charge of a final version of a text. You might also hear edit used when referring to video or film. If you edit a television show, for example, you assemble pieces of video or film footage to create a complete program.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2484,"<ul><li>A composition that is usually short and has a literary theme is called an essay. You should probably start writing your essay on ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" sometime before the bus ride to school the day it is due.</li><li>As a noun, an essay is also an attempt, especially a tentative initial one. Your essay to make friends at your new school would probably work better if you actually spoke to other students. As a verb, to essay is to make an attempt. If you essay to run for student council, you might lose to the girl who promises more recess, longer lunches, and less homework.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2485,"<ul><li>When you evaluate something, you're making a judgment, one that most likely results from some degree of analysis.</li><li>Breaking down the nutritional pros and cons of dessert options is evaluating. Diving into a tub of Ben and Jerry's because you have a craving is not.

The word evaluate was used as a mathematics term before it became part of standard usage. Thus, its wonky connotation of objectivity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2486,"<ul><li>Something faint has no courage or vigor. If you suddenly round the corner and see a gang of bullies staring straight at you, chances are you'll feel faint.</li><li>Faint comes from the French feindre, for being cowardly or shirking duties. We usually use it to mean without great strength. If you faint, you pass out, from low blood supply to your brain. If you feel faint, you feel weak. Faint also means dim or vague. If you're staring out to sea, you might see the faint outline of an approaching ship. If you really can't remember the answer to something, say you ""haven't the faintest idea.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2487,"<ul><li>When something is global, it's happening all over the world. It's easy to spot the connection between global and globe.</li><li>When the volcano in Iceland erupted, it quickly became a global event. Sure, things were tough in Reykjavík, but the dust and ash caused airport shutdowns and schedule disruptions around the world. Michael Jackson was a star in the United States from the time he was a little boy, but after he broke up with his brothers and went solo in the 1980s, he became a global phenomenon. There was hardly a country on earth where Michael Jackson wasn't a star.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2488,"<ul><li>A gymnasium is a place people go to exercise or participate in sports. Your neighborhood gymnasium might be a good place to play basketball, pump iron, or to check out the other gym rats.</li><li>The more common gym is a shortened form of gymnasium. Most schools have a gymnasium, a room where physical education classes are held and games like dodge ball and volleyball can be played. People also belong to private gymnasiums, where they take yoga classes and run on treadmills and lift weights. In Latin, gymnasium means ""school for gymnastics,"" from the Greek gymnasion, ""public place where athletic exercises are practiced.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2489,"<ul><li>If you missed the big game, don't worry — you can still catch the highlights on the news. A highlight is the most important or memorable part of something.</li><li>If you don’t have time to listen to your friend’s long, involved story, you might say, ""Just give me the highlights."" Highlight can also mean ""a lightness or a bright area."" If someone puts highlights in their hair, they are adding bright streaks to their hair. When used as a verb, highlight means ""to emphasize."" You may want to highlight the best grades on a report card while downplaying the lesser ones.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2490,"<ul><li>If you make an ignorant comment, your listeners might laugh at you, might get mad at you, or they might patiently instruct you in the ways that you are uninformed.</li><li>People can be generally ignorant, meaning that they are uneducated and lacking in sophistication. Or people can be ignorant of specific types of information. In fact, we all are. For example, most of us are ignorant of the particulars of nuclear physics and ignorant about what it takes to be an astronaut. Sometimes people are also labeled ignorant if they are rude, inconsiderate, or narrow-minded.</li></ul>"

It’s an alphabetical list in the back of the book that catalogs all of the subjects covered by page number.</li><li>In financial terms, an index is a list of stocks that are traded on the stock market, such as the Dow Jones Indexes. “Index cards” were once used to catalog books in a library, but now they’re mostly used to prepare for a test or a presentation, thanks to computers. As a verb, index describes the action of creating an index, such as, “I’m going to index my photo collection on my computer, so I can find what I’m looking for.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2492,"<ul><li>When your teacher stands up in front of you and teaches by talking about the latest chapter you've read or explaining how to do a new math problem - he is giving a lecture.</li><li>A lecture is most often used to describe a method of teaching, particularly popular in college, where professors give organized talks as lessons to large groups of students. It is not quite as positive when children level the term at their parents — ""Don't lecture me!"" — for criticizing their clothes, their friends or their music. Lecture can also be used to describe any public talk, most often by an expert.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2493,"<ul><li>The moral of a story is the lesson that story teaches about how to behave in the world.</li><li>Moral comes from the Latin word mores, for habits. The moral of a story is supposed to teach you how to be a better person. If moral is used as an adjective, it means good, or ethical.  If you have a strong moral character, you are a good member of society. If someone is a cheat and a liar, you might say, ""She is not a moral person.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2494,"<ul><li>You'll want to find a skilled surgeon to operate on your hand. Once your hand is working again, you'll be able to operate your buzz saw with ease.</li><li>Operate comes from a Latin root related to opus, ""work,"" and it's a verb that can be used for all kinds of work. Your computer can operate smoothly, the lottery can operate successfully, your school can operate a day care center in some vacant classrooms, and you can operate your vehicle in a safe manner. If you're an unshakable optimist, your friends may say you ""operate in a dream world.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2495,"<ul><li>Something private is something you don't want to share; it's for your eyes only. Your diary entries and your bank account balance might both be kept private.</li><li>As a noun, the lowest enlisted rank is called private. You may enlist as a private but have plans to retire from the Army as a four-star general! Sometimes the adjective private is used as the opposite of public. If you own your own island, it's private property. Alcatraz Island, however, is public property and the site of a museum preserving its past life as a famous prison — former home to Al Capone.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2496,"<ul><li>If something is recent, it happened in the immediate past or not long ago. You are a recent fan of yoga if you just started liking it in the past week or two.</li><li>If you talk about something that happened in recent months or years, it means the last one to three months or years. Otherwise, recent means new or just happened. It’s particularly useful when you don’t know exactly when something happened, but you know it wasn’t long ago. Perhaps you have been a recent guest star on a show, and your recent movies have been very successful. You know it wasn’t long ago at all and you are still a star!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2497,"<ul><li>The noun resolution has a few related meanings having to do with being firmly determined about something. If you lack determination, you'll never fulfill your New Year's resolutions.</li><li>Resolution is the noun form of the verb resolve, derived from the Latin resolvere, ""to loosen, undo, settle."" We can still see this meaning of resolution in the sense of ""an explanation"" or ""a solution"" — when a problem, conflict, or mystery reaches its resolution, it has been ""undone,"" so to speak. If you approach a task with resolution, you do it with determination. And if you make a resolution, you make a firm decision to do something or meet some goal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U05_2498,"<ul><li>A semester is half of a school year. In September of your first year of high school, you could describe yourself as ""a first-semester freshman.""</li><li>The noun semester comes up often when you're in high school and college. It's an easy way to divide the school year, into two equal halves, or semesters. Sometimes a class lasts for the whole year, and sometimes for just one semester. Occasionally schools split the year into three trimesters just to make things interesting. Originally, semester meant ""six months,"" from the Latin root of the same meaning, semestris.</li></ul>"

So is most abstract, conceptual performance art.</li><li>Our definition of weird is rooted in Germanic mythology, where the “weird sisters” were three funky-looking goddesses that controlled fate and destiny: We dropped the idea of destiny and clung to how weird the weird sisters looked. In today’s slang we even use weird as a verb, as in “to weird someone out” or make them feel uneasy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2501,"<ul><li>The verb accustom means to become used to or familiar with something; to make something a habit. If there is a new baby in your family, you will most likely become accustomed to changing diapers.</li><li>Although the verb accustom looks like it should be related to the word custom, it actually comes through costume, through the Old French acostumer, with à, meaning ""to,"" and costume, meaning ""fashion or habit."" Now it retains the meaning to make something a habit. You can accustom yourself to loud sirens if you live in a city or to the sound of crickets if you live in the country. Parents often cannot become accustomed to the musical taste of their kids.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2502,"<ul><li>Alpha is the first letter in the Greek alphabet. Many college fraternities are named after two or three Greek letters, often including an alpha.</li><li>Scientists frequently use alpha to mean the first item in a list or series, or the most important item in a group. An uppercase alpha looks identical to a capital A, while the lowercase version is similar but not identical to a small a: α. The Greek alpha comes from the Hebrew and Phoenician aleph, a form of the word for ""ox,"" eleph, possibly because the character resembled an ox's head.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2503,"<ul><li>Although the verb arouse basically means ""to wake up,"" it is usually not accomplished with an alarm clock. A patriotic song might arouse your love of country, and a new idea might arouse your imagination.</li><li>The word comes from an Old French word meaning ""stir up, awaken,"" and anything that arouses your mind or heart can awaken something in you; for example, the prospect of an exciting experience may arouse your sense of adventure. Arouse can also be used with negative feelings. A sneaky look might arouse your suspicion, or rejection might arouse a sense of bitterness. However, usually, arouse carries with it a sense of excitement, of bringing something to life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2504,"<ul><li>To articulate is to say something. And, if you say it well, someone might praise you by saying you are articulate. Confused yet? It's all in the pronunciation.</li><li>Reach for articulate when you need an adjective meaning ""well-spoken"" (pronounced ar-TIC-yuh-lit) or a verb (ar-TIC-yuh-late) meaning ""to speak or express yourself clearly."" The key to understanding articulate's many uses is to think of the related noun article: an articulate person clearly pronounces each article of his or her speech (that is, each word and syllable), and an articulated joint is divided up into distinct articles, or parts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2505,"<ul><li>A buzz is a vibrating sound, like the sound a bee makes. Your dog might get nervous in your yard when she hears the buzz of insects.</li><li>Buzz can be a noun or a verb: ""My doorbell started to buzz like crazy when everyone showed up for my party."" You can also talk about a buzz of activity, a low background noise, or describe the way stunt planes buzz the trees, flying very low. You might tell someone to ""buzz off"" if you're annoyed with them — this began in 1914 as a way to describe hanging up a telephone — or telling someone to hang up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2506,"<ul><li>When two things clash, they run violently into each other, often with an accompanying loud noise.  The percussionist in an orchestra has the enviable job of making two cymbals clash together.</li><li>Kids clash when they run into each other on the playground, but they can also clash through a strong disagreement: ""My cousins always clash when it comes to deciding what movie to watch after dinner."" Also, your shirt might clash with your pants, if the colors or prints simply don't go together. Clash is imitative — it sounds like its original meaning, ""make a loud, sharp sound,"" and may be related to the words clap and crash.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2507,"<ul><li>Classification is the process of putting something into a category. Classification of all your clothes by color may make it easier for you to put together an outfit, especially if you favor a monochrome look.</li><li>Classification involves putting things into a class or group according to particular characteristics so it’s easier to make sense of them, whether you’re organizing your shoes, your stock portfolio, or a group of invertebrates. If you’re an international spy, you might know that classification also can mean a government’s system for keeping secrets. If you have a high level of security classification, then you know really top secret stuff.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2508,"<ul><li>To cling is to tightly grasp something or to stick closely to something, like how wet clothes cling to the wearer.</li><li>Clinging has to do with closeness. A scared child will cling to his parent, holding on tight. People in love cling to one another in embraces. When you're on a roller coaster, it's best to cling to whatever restraint you can. Similarly, things cling to each other when they're hard to separate. Clothes fresh out of the dryer often cling to each other. Strands of cooked spaghetti cling to each other. Stretchy clothing like spandex clings to the bodies of the people who wear it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2509,"<ul><li>Compliance is what you do when you try to fit standards set down by someone else. A restaurant chef's compliance with a new sugar-free menu might inspire even the pastry chefs to follow the recipes.</li><li>Plywood helps illustrate the ""pli"" in compliance, because if you've ever stepped on a piece of plywood stretched across something, you've felt how it gives underneath your feet. It has flexibility. Compliance means being flexible or yielding and giving in to a situation or order. ""Pliant"" is part of the word compliance, and it means yielding. Agreeing or bending to something like a plan, rule, or direction is compliance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2510,"<ul><li>To comprehend something is to understand it, like when you have to read a difficult passage more than once in order to comprehend it.</li><li>When you comprehend something, you grasp its meaning.  Comprehend is a verb that originates from the Latin word comprehendere, which means “catch or seize.”  When an idea is clear to you and you understand it completely, you comprehend it, like doing extra problems to make sure you comprehend a difficult algebra rule, or finding it hard to comprehend why someone would paint his house neon yellow.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2511,"<ul><li>Congregate is a verb that means to come together, to assemble, or to gather. At school dances, you may congregate with your friends, because you get nervous in front of kids you don't know very well.</li><li>Congregate comes from Latin root words com, meaning ""together"" and gregare, meaning ""to gather in a flock."" Congregation, or a gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does gregarious, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to socialize. If you remember the key word is flock — what ministers often call their congregations — you should have no trouble remembering congregate means to flock together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2512,"<ul><li>When you are legally responsible for another person, they are in your custody. Most parents have custody over their children.</li><li>The word custody brings with it the meaning of care for. When someone is in your custody, it is not just that they reside with you, it is that you are responsible for taking good care of them. If you are arrested, you will be taken into police custody. While there in jail, it is their responsibility to protect you from harm.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2513,"<ul><li>To make a crowd at a party disperse, you could take away the food, turn off the music and ask for volunteers to clean up. Disperse is to spread out people or things, making them move in different directions.</li><li>Imagine yourself standing on a basketball court holding a cup packed tight with marbles. If you turn it over, the marbles will disperse across the floor, moving away from you in all directions. Another word for this is scatter. Don't confuse this word with disburse, which means to distribute money. Remember that false friends disperse when you cease to disburse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2514,"<ul><li>To embody a role is to fill it completely. If a high schooler seems to embody the character of Macbeth, his performance might make the audience forget they're watching a dorky 15-year-old with braces.</li><li>If you embody someone, you put him or her ""in-body,"" as when an actor gives a complete and compelling representation of a character. You can also use embody to describe character traits you see in a person, like, “He embodies truth,” or, “She is the embodiment of goodness.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2515,"<ul><li>If knowledge is empirical, it's based on observation rather than theory. To do an empirical study of donut shops, you'll need to visit every one you can find.</li><li>Empirical looks like empire but comes from a completely different origin: it is from the Greek empeirikos, meaning ""experienced."" It was originally used in medicine for doctors making choices based on observation and experiment rather than theoretical ideas. It's now used for any kind of knowledge that comes from experience. You can meditate all day on the origins of donuts, but until you visit the donut bakery you'll lack empirical knowledge of donut creation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2516,"<ul><li>An exclusion is an instance of leaving something or someone out. If you love someone to the exclusion of all others, he or she is the only one for you!</li><li>Exclusion is closely related to some words that have a positive or negative feel. The word exclusive implies something is high-end, desirable, and not for ordinary people. If someone is excluded, on the other hand, it means that someone has been deliberately and painfully left out. Exclusion is more neutral. The department store that advertises a big sale often states at the bottom of the ad that ""some exclusions apply,"" meaning the discounts don't apply to all items.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2517,"<ul><li>The word flock refers to a group of animals, like birds or sheep, that have congregated together. The flock of pigeons at the park is so tame that they'll eat right out of your hand.</li><li>You can also use flock to mean a congregation of people, like a flock of children at the zoo, or a group of people belonging to a church. As a verb, flock means to gather together as a flock or to move together in a group. You and your friends might flock to the mall when you learn that your favorite singer will be there signing autographs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2518,"<ul><li>Cows graze on grass, and people graze on snacks and finger foods. Graze can also mean to scrape, like when you graze your elbow after falling off your bike.</li><li>Graze means ""to feed on grass"" as sheep, horses, cows, do in a meadow — they eat a little at a time, but constantly. People sometimes graze too, munching on small snacks all day long instead of having a real meal. It also means “to touch lightly,” like when I pitch a baseball to you — and I accidentally hit your arm. With luck, the ball only grazed you, meaning you aren't hurt at all.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2519,"<ul><li>Humans? Intelligent! Potted plants? Not so much. Intelligent means smart, or having the ability to process and understand information (including dictionary definitions).</li><li>Intelligent comes from a Latin word meaning ""to understand, to gather,"" and intelligent creatures gather and make sense of information easily. Intelligent also refers to the ability to think. Intelligent objects, like speakers or software, seem to think in the way they react to change. If we’re looking for intelligent life on Mars, we want Martians who can reason. Intelligent also means showing good judgement, like an intelligent decision not to invite all those Martians to your birthday party.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U06_2520,"<ul><li>A jungle is a forest thick with trees, other plants, and animals. Jungles are a little dangerous, which is what people mean when they say, ""It's a jungle out there!""</li><li>Jungles — thick tropical forests — are full of life: birds, insects, reptiles, monkeys, and often gorillas and other animals. They're dangerous places, even for the animals that live there. This is why jungle also means any place that is risky or wild. If someone does something a dishonest or shady to get their way, some people will say that's ""The law of the jungle,"" meaning you have to do some shifty things to survive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2521,"<ul><li>An account can be many things — such as a story, like if you give a friend an account of what happened at the party she missed. It can also be a business arrangement, like a bank account or an email account.</li><li>Account is one of those seemingly simple words that have a mass of different meanings. An account can be a narrative or story — a biography, for example, is an account of someone's life. Account can also mean an explanation of something, as in the phrase, ""How do you account for that?"" An account is also a handy arrangement whereby a store agrees to provide you goods on credit, but then you might have to account for all that debt.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2522,"<ul><li>A person who designs buildings is an architect. If you become an architect, you'll be responsible for drawing the blueprints, planning the work, and sometimes even overseeing the construction of a building.</li><li>Frank Lloyd Wright was a famous architect who helped complete over 500 projects in his lifetime, including private homes, skyscrapers, museums, churches, and schools. Architects work on buildings of all types, and the Greek root arkhitektōn literally means “chief builder.”  An architect can construct other things too, like the architects who design a video game, or the architect of your misfortune who dumped green slime on your head at a school dance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2523,"<ul><li>When you conceal something, you are keeping it from being discovered: “To avoid another argument with his cousins, Jonathan worked hard to conceal his disappointment at the outcome of the race.”</li><li>The verb conceal can be used to describe the hiding of feelings (as in “to conceal anger”) or facts (as in “to conceal identity”). Conceal also can be used to describe the act of hiding or covering an item to prevent discovery. If you eat the last piece of chocolate cake, for example, you may want to conceal the evidence by removing the icing-stained plate from your room.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2524,"<ul><li>Something that's against the law is a crime. If your friend shoplifts clothes from a store, you'll be disappointed because you know that stealing is a serious crime.</li><li>A crime is an illegal act that someone can be legally punished for, like damaging someone's property. You can also talk about crime more generally to describe something that's unfair, wrong, and difficult to fix, like the crime of art museums charging high admission prices, making it all but impossible for many families to afford to go often.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2525,"<ul><li>A deed is an action that you perform with intent, like turning in a lost wallet you find in a store. Definitely a good deed.</li><li>The word deed is often used to describe acts of charity but an action doesn’t have to be good to be called a deed — people go to jail for their criminal deeds. Either way, a deed is something done on purpose. It could be difficult, as anyone who after breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend later told friends, ""I did the deed,"" will know. An unrelated meaning of deed is a legal document that shows who owns a building or land.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2526,"<ul><li>Gratitude means thanks and appreciation. It's the warm feeling you get when you remember the person who told you to drop your 1980s hairstyle and get with the new millennium already.</li><li>Though they both recognize the instrumental roles others have played in our lives, gratitude is different from indebtedness. Gratitude, which rhymes with ""attitude,"" comes from the Latin word gratus, which means ""thankful, pleasing."" When you feel gratitude, you're pleased by what someone did for you and also pleased by the results. Unlike indebtedness, you're not anxious about having to pay it back. But it's still great to tell the recipient of your gratitude how much they mean to you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2527,"<ul><li>Your habitat is the environment you are accustomed to living in. Zoos usually try to mimic the habitats of the animals they keep, housing bats in a nocturnal house and monkeys in a cage with trees to climb and swing from.</li><li>The origins of habitat aren't exactly what you would expect. The word goes back to the Latin habitare meaning ""to live or dwell,"" which itself goes back to habere meaning ""to have or own."" It seems logical that if you own a place, it is your home. Habitat is usually used with animals and plants that live in and are adapted to a specific environment. In nature, orchids and banana plants live in a warm, humid habitat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2528,"<ul><li>From the Latin ""intervenire,"" meaning “to come between,” the verb intervene means just that: to get involved, to jump in the middle of something, to interfere.</li><li>The verb intervene was first recorded around 1600. Since then there haven't been many interventions in its meaning or usage. You should probably intervene in a heated verbal fight between two of your friends before it escalates and gets physical. Especially if they're debating the United States’ habit of intervening in international conflicts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2529,"<ul><li>A landmark is anything that helps you know where you are — in space, in time, in history.</li><li>If you’re sailing from Europe to New York, the Statue of Liberty will be the landmark that lets you know you’re in the right port. If you’re walking to your cousin’s house, the pizza shop on the corner is the landmark that lets you know you just have two blocks to go. Getting your driver’s license is a landmark event, as was the Revolutionary War — though which battle was harder is yours to determine.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2530,"<ul><li>Legal means having to do with the law, or following the law. Attorneys work in the legal profession but may not always be so lucky as to find a legal parking spot near their office.</li><li>A legal scholar is someone who studies law. A legal search and seizure is when the cops come to you house with a warrant. A legal apartment is one that meets building code and is in an appropriately zoned neighborhood. Legal's opposite is illegal, which means against the law.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2531,"<ul><li>The adjective memorable is good for describing something that you just can't forget, like the first time you ever saw your Uncle Marvin in his full clown costume.</li><li>Something that's memorable is easily remembered because of how unusual it is — like the time you saw your grandmother's cat using the toilet — or because it is meaningful or special like the memorable day when you met your best friend or the memorable concert in which you got to dance onstage with the singer. The Latin word for worthy of being remembered, memorabilis , is the root of memorable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2532,"<ul><li>To oblige is to do something you have to, because you're bound by either good manners or the law.</li><li>You are obliged to pay back your student loans, or for your portion of the dinner bill. You may also feel obliged to bring a gift if you're invited to a wedding. You can also tip your cowboy hat and be ""much obliged"" if someone does you a favor. The French phrase, noblesse oblige means basically that ""privilege entails responsibility,"" or that the wealthy are obliged to do something productive in the world and not just sit around polishing their silver spoons.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2533,"<ul><li>The part of a team that tries to score points is called the offense. If you play forward on a soccer team, you are on offense.</li><li>If you offend someone — that is you cause them to be upset because of your actions or words — then you may need to apologize for the offense. After all, you meant no offense when you said that disco was dead. How were you to know the guy still loved the '70s? In the eyes of the law, an offense is a crime.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2534,"<ul><li>""I proclaim the Olympic Games open."" Every two years with words similar to these, the Olympic games officially begin. To proclaim is to exclaim or declare.</li><li>When you proclaim something, you are saying it loud and clear and in public. A doctor can proclaim you healthy after you have recovered from a long illness. The panel of judges may have trouble proclaiming the winner in a very tight race. What you are saying out loud can be called a proclamation. Proclamations were once only made by Kings or other ruling leaders which is why the word proclaim has an official feeling to it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2535,"<ul><li>Use the verb rally to describe that last push to finish a difficult something. When you hit that last mile in the race and are so tired you want to quit, that's when you rally, finding the strength to pick up the pace.</li><li>The verb rally is often used to describe a physical effort that has been renewed, but it can describe anything that involves bouncing back from a setback. For example, if something makes you feel disappointed, you rally to get your positive attitude back. Rally can also describe bringing people together, often to support a cause. The event itself is also called a rally, like pep rally in which students boost the confidence of their team as it heads into the championship game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2536,"<ul><li>To resolve is to settle or make a decision about something — often formal. A college's board of directors  might resolve to recruit more minority students. As a noun, resolve refers to a strong determination to do something.</li><li>If you make a New Year's resolution to exercise every day, you'll need plenty of resolve to stick with your program. The verb descends from Middle English resolven ""to dissolve,"" from Latin resolvere ""to untie."" In English, the obsolete sense of ""to dissolve"" can be seen in this line from Shakespeare: ""O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2537,"<ul><li>A resource is any personal talent or outside supply that can be tapped for help or support.</li><li>Resource comes from an old French word meaning ""relief"" or ""recovery,"" which certainly ties in with the idea of a resource being something that offers necessary aid. However, the word resource also refers to the natural resources available in and on our Earth — things that we are constantly drawing on and depleting, such as our trees, ores, and atmosphere. Once such a natural resource is used up, it’s usually gone forever, and is no longer a resource.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2538,"<ul><li>A sentence can be a group of words that communicate a complete thought, or it can be the punishment in a criminal case.  Did your pen pal in prison write a sentence or two about the length of his sentence?</li><li>Actually, both meanings of sentence — words and punishment — are linked, coming from the Latin sententia, meaning ""thought or judgment,"" derived from the verb sentire, ""to feel or perceive.""  If you put some words before a period, you should give some thought to your sentence.  If you receive a lengthy prison sentence, you will certainly feel it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2539,"<ul><li>To volunteer means to freely offer up your time and service to help. So a volunteer might offer to water a neighbor's plants while he's on vacation or sign up to serve dinner at a local homeless shelter.</li><li>When it came into usage circa 1600, the noun volunteer referred to a person who offered himself up for military service. It wasn't until a few decades later that the word was first used in a non-military sense. And a little over a hundred years after that, volunteer expanded from functioning as just a noun to also playing the role of verb. A volunteer is someone who volunteers: willingly performs a task or offers a service.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U07_2540,"<ul><li>If you're walking down the street and see one car run a red light and plow into another, you are a witness to the accident. You saw it and can tell someone else how the accident happened.</li><li>The first part of a witness's role is observation. You witness the accident. The second part is telling someone about it — bearing witness. In court, you can be a witness for the defense or prosecution. You can also witness a legal document, like a will, or a wedding conducted by the justice of the peace. Religious people use this word a lot too: being a witness in that sense is being a true believer who tries to convert others.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2541,"<ul><li>Most libraries provide computers you can use to access the Internet. If chemicals are being stolen from a lab, you might ask who has access to the lab. Access is approaching or making use of something, or the ability to do so</li><li>Sometimes the word is applied to a person. If you work in the same room as your boss, you might have easy access to her. A really good boss will work hard to make herself accessible to her employees.  Access is from Middle English, from Middle French acces ""arrival,"" from Latin accessus ""an approach,"" from accedere ""to approach.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2542,"<ul><li>The noun conduct refers to behavior, like how students are rewarded for good conduct. The verb conduct means carry something through, as in ""to conduct a survey."" And if you lead an orchestra, you conduct it.</li><li>Your conduct (accent on the first syllable), or your own behavior, is the way you conduct (accent on the second syllable), or lead, yourself. Keep the accent on the second syllable to conduct, or lead, an orchestra, and to conduct an interview by asking someone questions. Also, metals like copper or gold conduct electricity by letting the electricity pass through.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2543,"<ul><li>Think of something or someone that does not change as constant.  A classmate's constant drumming on the table with his fingers could be a constant source of annoyance.</li><li>Constant derives from Latin verb meaning ""to stand with,"" so something constant is continually standing with you and not wavering. You may be thankful for the constant companionship of your dog but not necessarily for your teacher's constant homework assignments. In math and science, a constant is a number that is fixed and known, unlike a variable which changes with the context. That idea crosses over to real life. If a friend is a constant in your life, that means they have always been with you and there for you.</li></ul>"

If your favorite mug has a crack in it, it might leak.</li><li>A crack can be as thin as a pencil line, or a wider gap, like a crack where your foot gets stuck as you climb down the side of a mountain. Crack is also a verb, meaning ""to split or break,"" and also ""to give way under pressure,"" as when a suspect cracks after hours of being interrogated. An informal kind of crack is a joke: ""That crack he made about my haircut really hurt my feelings.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2545,"<ul><li>A device is really anything that has a specific use. It might be a tool or object, or a plan that is devised to accomplish something. If it has a purpose, it is a device.</li><li>A device is a noun that can be used to describe anything, simple or complex, that is used for a specific purpose. You might have one device for opening bottles, and another for opening cans. You probably even have a device for turning on your TV. While these have specific names (bottle opener, can opener, remote), you can cover each with the generic term device.  We can see its root in the Old French word devis, which meant “purpose” or “contrivance.”</li></ul>"

A crowd of people could enclose a celebrity, or a wall might enclose a garden. In Edgar Allan Poe’s story “Masque of the Red Death,” the Prince encloses his party guests inside the castle walls (along with the Red Death). (Oops!) A box might enclose a present. If you enclose something with a letter, you’re putting it in the envelope, too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2547,"<ul><li>To grip something is to hold it firmly. You might grip the TV remote to keep your roommate from trying to change the channel.</li><li>When you want to hold on to something, you grip it. If your hands are strong and you can hold things well, you have a good grip. Grip is also the roughness or texture of something. A steering wheel has good grip if your hands don't slip while driving. This word can be also be used figuratively. If you’re upset, your friend might tell you to “get a grip” — that is, get a hold of yourself.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2548,"<ul><li>Whether it's used as a noun or a verb, the word halt means stop. You can remember this by remembering that when you step on the brake to halt your car (verb), it comes to a halt (noun).</li><li>English draws on both Romance and Germanic languages, and halt is one that comes from the Old High German haltmachen, which means ""to hold."" The word suggests a stoppage in the midst of action, and a Chinese proverb states, “We are not so much concerned if you are slow as when you come to a halt.” Consider, also, that a less-used definition of the word is that of ""lame"" or disabled, which still ties in with the idea of stopping.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2549,"<ul><li>If something is impending, it is about to happen. If you hear thunder in the distance, you might go inside to escape the impending storm.</li><li>The word impending often refers to something threatening or frightening: impending doom, impending disaster. Something that is impending hangs over you — you might say, ""I was so distracted by thoughts of my impending failure in my exams, I couldn't study."" A synonym is imminent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2550,"<ul><li>Influence is the power to have an important effect on someone or something. If someone influences someone else, they are changing a person or thing in an indirect but important way.</li><li>Sometimes a person who influences another doesn't intend to have any effect, but sometimes they are using influence to benefit themselves. An example of a personal benefit or advantage would be the use of political influence. Influence is also a verb, from Latin influere to flow in.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2551,"<ul><li>Law has to do with rules and legal systems. If you live by the letter of the law, you follow society's guidelines to a T: you cross at the corner and always wait until the light is green.</li><li>A law is a rule that specifies what you can and can't do. Laws govern communities, countries, and even the world. Your town might have a leash law for dog owners, and international law prohibits throwing garbage off a boat. You can also refer to the police as ""the law,"" as in ""Don’t make me call the law."" Law also refers to the entire legal system: We are all equal before the law (at least in theory).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2552,"<ul><li>You can describe the specific style of doing something as your mode.  If you're in vacation mode, for example, it might mean you say everything in a super-relaxed voice and spend all of your classes daydreaming.</li><li>From the Latin modus or ""manner,"" it has been popular since the 1400s.  Since the 1600s, people have been using it as another word for ""fashionable.""  The French term ""a la mode"" literally means ""in the fashion,"" or ""fashionable,"" but is more commonly used to describe as specific way of serving dessert (ice cream on the side).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2553,"<ul><li>To perspire is to sweat: to excrete perspiration through the pores in your skin.</li><li>Whenever little drops of moisture appear on your skin, you're perspiring or sweating. People sweat when they're nervous, when it's hot out, and when they're doing a lot of exercise. If you watch people playing a strenuous sport like basketball, they will be perspiring. Perspiring is one way your body cools itself off, so sweating is a good thing, even though it can make you feel gross. Some animals — like dogs — can't perspire, so it's harder for them to cool off.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2554,"<ul><li>Is your pen not working? Maybe you need to replace it. To replace is to substitute one thing for another — in this case, to get a new pen and throw the old one away.</li><li>When you see the word place in it, replace makes sense: replacing is putting something new in place of something old. We need to replace most things at some point: light bulbs burn out and batteries run out, while computers, cars, and socks wear out. When something stops working or is just worn out and old, it might be time to replace it. It's natural to worry that your boss might want to replace you — i.e., fire you and hire someone else. Some things in life cannot be replaced, like a winning lottery ticket or a friend.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2555,"<ul><li>Oh, snap! When something snaps, it breaks or separates suddenly, often with a cracking sound. A snap can also be a fastener on clothes. And if you like a song, you can snap your fingers to the beat or snap a selfie of yourself dancing.</li><li>The verb snap is useful for many things that make a similar sharp sound, like when you snap your lunchbox shut, snap your fingers, or snap a whip. An animal's quick, strong bite is also a snap. As a noun, it can mean ""fastener"" or ""the sound of a snap."" A snap judgment is a decision you make almost instantaneously, and a cold snap is a short period of bitter weather.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2556,"<ul><li>When you're sly, you're crafty, cunning, tricky, and wily. Being sly is being deceitful, though not in the worst way.</li><li>If you're good at lying, you're quite sly: people who are sly are good at pulling one over on other people. Being sly helps you get away with things. If you made a mess in your house but got your parents to blame the dog, that was sly. Being sly means you're not being honest, but this word has kind of a harmless flavor to it. Someone who killed someone and lied about it would not be described as sly. Slyness has to do with smaller, sneakier, more harmless kinds of lying.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2557,"<ul><li>If you manage, run, or work at a store, you can say you tend it. If you tend the bar in a restaurant, for example, you serve drinks, dry glasses, and fill dishes with pretzels.</li><li>You can also say you tend something if you care for it. You have to tend a vegetable garden, for example, if you expect to harvest more vegetables than weeds. If you are inclined to do something, then you tend to do that thing. You might tend to let your homework go until the last minute and then stay up all night to get it done — probably not the most efficient way to go about it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2558,"<ul><li>A valid argument is one that is well-grounded in fact, law or logic. ""Their argument for annulment was valid because they had never even met and their marriage was the result of a clerical error at town hall.""</li><li>Something is valid when it can be supported or backed-up, or if it is functional: “She figured her password was valid because she had just set it.”  In a legal context, valid means that something is binding or actionable: “At the time of the accident his license was no longer valid, so they impounded his car.”  The logical grounding of an argument can be valid: “That’s a valid point about Santa being too large to fit down a chimney.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2559,"<ul><li>If the professor says, “Read the complete works of Shakespeare” and you go for the Cliff Notes, you could say you read a short version of the Bard’s work, but really, you're cheating. A version is a specific edition or form of something.</li><li>Version derives from the Latin vertere, ""to turn."" Think of it as someone taking a turn, as in an adaptation of a work of art or literature. ""Can you believe they made an animated version of The Sinking of the Lusitania?"" Or someone giving their own account of an event. ""Your version of what happened the night we got locked in the storage unit is totally different from mine!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U08_2560,"<ul><li>The word whatsoever is an old-fashioned way to emphasize a point. If you have no clue whatsoever who ate all the ice cream that was in the freezer, it means you truly have no idea at all who the culprit is.</li><li>If you say that you have no doubt whatsoever that your cousin could be a model, you are placing emphasis on the fact that you're sure she's tall and thin enough to do the job. Whatsoever, originally quuat-so-euere, was first used in the thirteenth century, and while it's rare these days, it eventually led to the more modern and extremely popular word whatever.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2561,"<ul><li>Use the adverb alongside when two things are right next to each other, like a boat and a dock or a hunter and her loyal dog.</li><li>If you pull up alongside your friend's car in a parking lot, it means that you've parked directly beside it. Alongside can also imply cooperation, as when a baker's assistant works alongside him, kneading dough and wiping flour off the counter. Alongside was once a phrase, either ""along side"" or ""along the side,"" both primarily used in a nautical sense, to talk about boats. In the 1700s it became a single word.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2562,"<ul><li>If you've filled your plate three times, you must have a strong appetite.  I hope you still have room for dessert.</li><li>The Latin word appetitus, meaning ""desire for,"" is the root for appetite.  If you have worked up an appetite, you have a desire for food.  If you've lost your appetite, you're not hungry at all (maybe because something upset you).  You can have an appetite for things other than food. Perhaps you have an appetite for power, or funny movies, or for little silver shoes with buttons on them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2563,"<ul><li>You run up the field, pass the ball to the forward and she scores!  It’s your third assist of the game. On and off the soccer field, to assist is to help or contribute.</li><li>The English word assist came to us in the early 15th century from the French word assister, meaning to ""to stand by or help.” The French word is pronounced ""ah-sis-tay"" and is not to be confused with ""a sister."" Even if your sister is helpful.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2564,"<ul><li>A breeze is a light, cool wind. One of the nicest things about being at the beach on a hot summer day is feeling the gentle breeze off the water.</li><li>The air that blows your hair around and rustles the leaves is one kind of breeze. Another is the task that's easily completed or the job that is practically effortless: ""Your dog is so good, walking him is a breeze!"" You can also breeze through something that's simple and fast, like when you breeze through a math test, finishing long before your classmates.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2565,"<ul><li>To defy is to openly refuse to do something. You can defy the no-costumes-in-class rule if you wear your fairy wings to school, but just don’t try to defy the laws of gravity unless you can actually fly.</li><li>If you deliberately break a rule or ignore an order, you defy, or resist, that rule. The word defy comes from the Latin word disfidare for ""renounce one's faith."" So if you're expected to be faithful to a certain law or rule but you refuse to be, you defy it. There are different ways to defy — defy your parents by staying out past curfew, or defy common sense by walking in with shoes on your head.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2566,"<ul><li>When you display something, you show everyone. If you run up to someone in the street, throw your arms around her, and plant a big kiss on her face, you're displaying your affection for all the world to see.</li><li>Besides public displays of emotion, a display can also be common and lifeless. Department store windows often have elaborate displays of the latest fashions, and your computer screen can also be called a display. If you’re especially proud of your butterfly collection, you can put it on display in your office. When showing off for the ladies, peacocks fan out their colorful tail feathers, and that, too, is called a display — a word for male animal courtship behavior.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2567,"<ul><li>The adjective efficient describes function and use with the least amount of waste and most economy.</li><li>When you want to define the adjective efficient, it's a good idea to say as much as you can in as few words as possible because to be efficient is to be economical and avoid waste in actions or uses. The word comes from the Latin efficientem which means ""work out"" or ""accomplish."" Synonyms of efficient are effective, productive, and competent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2568,"<ul><li>You know how you feel when you can’t open a jar of pickles? And then grandma walks in and does it in one shot without even grunting? That’s called feeling feeble, or lacking strength.</li><li>In fact, feeble, comes from the Latin word flebilis, which means ""lamentable"" or ""unsatisfactory."" But don’t let it get to you. Your puny, inferior muscles are nothing compared to the guy who makes feeble attempts at humor. Lame-o jokes are way more lamentable than inadequate biceps.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2569,"<ul><li>If you forgive someone, you stop blaming him. You should really forgive your kid sister for eating the rest of the cake.</li><li>Forgive comes from the Old English forgiefan, which also means ""forgive,"" just with cooler spelling. When you forgive someone or something, that's the end of the story. Eventually, you will have to either forgive your friend for stealing your boyfriend, or stop being her friend. Loans can also be forgiven. If your credit card company forgives your debt, that means you no longer have to pay it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2570,"<ul><li>If you’re feeling lively, you might whistle a tune, go for a brisk jog, or strike up an amusing conversation. Lively means ""active, spirited, and energetic.""</li><li>Lively is an adjective derived from the noun ""life,"" and it basically means ""full of life."" A lively party is exciting and entertaining. A lively person has an energetic personality, is always on alert, and prefers being active as opposed to just hanging around. Note that a ""lively discussion"" isn’t necessarily a happy discussion; it could be a spirited or even heated conversation where all parties are actively involved. Lively means the opposite of sluggish or dull.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2571,"<ul><li>Majestic things display great dignity, befit a great ruler, or are simply far superior to everyday stuff. Compared with a peasant's hut, for instance, a king's palace is quite majestic.</li><li>The adjective majestic has origins in the Latin word majestatem, meaning ""greatness, dignity, honor, or excellence."" It's often used to describe things connected with kings and queens (whom, you'll remember, we often address as ""Your Majesty""). We also like to refer to the great creatures and places of the natural world as majestic: Mt. Fuji in Japan for example, or a bald eagle flying over the Grand Canyon.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2572,
4000EEW_B05_U09_2573,"<ul><li>When you're outraged, you're furious. You might be outraged over the rude treatment you get at a fancy, expensive restaurant.</li><li>When something isn't fair, or offends you, it often results in your feeling outraged. You might be outraged on a friend's behalf after her brand new laptop is stolen, or feel outraged about the treatment of inmates at your state's largest prison. The adjective outraged comes from the noun outrage, with its oldest meaning of ""evil deed, offense, or crime."" The Latin root is ultra, or ""beyond.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2574,"<ul><li>Pessimistic describes the state of mind of someone who always expects the worst. A pessimistic attitude isn't very hopeful, shows little optimism, and can be a downer for everyone else.</li><li>To be pessimistic means you believe evil outweighs the good and that bad things are more likely to happen. So pessimistic people are usually pretty negative. And kind of a bummer to be around. Think of Eeyore, Winnie the Pooh's perpetually gloomy friend. The word comes to us, not surprisingly, from the Latin pessimus — meaning ""worst.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2575,"<ul><li>When you're in a relationship, you're emotionally involved or at least connected in some way. If you're related to somebody — your parents, your aunts and uncles, your cousins — you share a family relationship with them.</li><li>You can also use relationship to describe dealings between various groups, as “Members of the European Union have a relationship of economic interconnectedness,” or “A lease helps define your relationship with your landlord.” You'll also see relationship used with interactions that don't directly involve people. In many of these cases, the word relation is better. For example, in the sentence ""We are always looking at the relationship between ticket price and sales,"" it would be better to use relation.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2576,"<ul><li>To slap someone is to hit them with the palm of your open hand. It's not nice to slap your sister, no matter how mad you are.</li><li>A smack or open-handed blow is a slap, and you can also describe the sound it makes—or a similar sound—as a slap. You could describe the slap of water against the side of your rowboat, or say that your mom slaps her magazine against the table when she's done reading. Slap is also an informal adverb, meaning ""immediately"" or ""directly:""  ""Sneaking out of class, he ran slap into the principal.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2577,"<ul><li>To smash something is to hit or throw it so hard that it breaks or is hurt. It's important to pay careful attention while you're driving so you don't smash into the car in front of you.</li><li>A running child can smash into her friend and knock her down, and an angry chef can smash a plate by throwing it on the floor. In the latter example, there's the additional meaning of ""break into pieces."" A smash can be a car accident, but it can also be a ""great big success,"" like a TV series that starts slow but turns out to be a smash. This ""hit"" meaning dates from 1920s reviews of Broadway plays.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2578,"<ul><li>If you win or do well, at whatever it is you do, you are successful. Successful people usually get more money, attention, and praise.</li><li>If you go into business and make a lot of money, you're successful. If you play tennis and finish the season with more wins than losses, you've been successful. If you have a successful pregnancy, you give birth to a healthy baby. Successful is one of those words that covers a great deal of ground; it generally applies to anything, anyone or any venture that ends well. When you see the word successful, think ""Winning!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2579,"<ul><li>If your job pays a good wage, it means that you earn a lot of money for the hard work you do. If you're not happy with your wage, you might have to wage war on your boss.</li><li>Wage is one of those words whose verb and noun forms have entirely different meanings. A worker's wage is how much money she makes. But when you wage something, you carry it out: for example, a warmonger is someone whose primary goal is to wage wars. The word is of Germanic origin, and it's related to both gage and wed, with their underlying meanings of ""to pledge.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U09_2580,
4000EEW_B05_U10_2581,"<ul><li>At its most basic, animate means simply alive, while inanimate means not living, not moving around. But animate also means spirited, or brought to life.</li><li>Animated cartoons are what we think of as pictures come to life: animation. Animate derives from the Latin anima ""life, soul, spirit."" When you seem particularly filled with life, or high-spirited, if you laugh loudly, or use broad gestures, you're animated.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2582,"<ul><li>Humans seem to have the need to classify things, arranging them into different classes by such unifying traits as size, color, or shape. It’s fine to do this to inanimate objects, but doing it to people can be very wrong.</li><li>The word classify contains the base word class, which means ""category"" and comes from the Latin classis, which actually referred to an army or group called to arms. It eventually came to mean ""a group,"" and thus classify means ""to group."" As a security measure, you can also classify information that is not to be shared. Writer Ambrose Bierce once said, “The small part of ignorance that we arrange and classify we give the name of knowledge.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2583,"<ul><li>If you concede something, you admit that it is true, proper, or certain — usually in an unwilling way and often in the context of a competition, as in ""At midnight, the candidate finally conceded defeat.""</li><li>In its most common senses, a near synonym of concede is acknowledge — if your mom is pointing out that you need sleep before the test, you should concede the truth of what she's saying. But another meaning of concede is to give away or grant something, as when an unpopular leader is unwilling to concede power. Concede is from Latin concēdere, from the prefix com-, ""completely,"" plus cēdere, ""to go along, grant, yield."" The corresponding noun is concession.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2584,"<ul><li>A concept is a thought or idea. If you're redecorating your bedroom, you might want to start with a concept, such as ""flower garden"" or ""outer space.""</li><li>It's a general idea about a thing or group of things, derived from specific instances or occurrences. It often applies to a theoretical idea in science: Einstein's contribution to the concept of relativity. Concept was borrowed from Late Latin conceptus, from Latin concipere ""to take in, conceive, receive."" A concept is an idea conceived in the mind. The original meaning of the verb conceive was to take sperm into the womb, and by a later extension of meaning, to take an idea into the mind.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2585,"<ul><li>To construct things is to build them. You might construct a sand castle the next time you're at the beach, or you might construct a theory about why your brother always manages to get away with breaking the rules.</li><li>The verb construct comes from the Latin word constructus, meaning “to heap up.” If you work in construction you're in the business of building things, and you probably construct buildings, roads, municipal parks, and other large permanent structures. Students of psychology are familiar with the noun form of construct, which refers to an abstract concept. Much of psychological theory is founded on constructs — like gender, morality, and intelligence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2586,"<ul><li>She was so nervous to see her high school sweetheart at their reunion: it had been a decade (ten years) since she'd seen him at graduation, and she still got butterflies thinking about him.</li><li>A decade is a period of ten years. Decade contains dec, which is used in words that have to do with tens. The Marty Paich Dectet was a band with ten players. A decahedron is a shape with ten faces. And the decimal system is based on the number ten.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2587,"<ul><li>A diagram is a drawing that shows the different parts of something and how they work together. If you follow a diagram for assembling bunk beds and finish with parts left over, you should ask for the top bunk, not the bottom one.</li><li>Diagram goes back to the Greek verb diagraphein, meaning ""to mark out by lines,"" and a diagram uses line drawings to explain something. Electronic equipment comes with a long instruction booklet and a one-page diagram, and it's usually the diagram that helps most in connecting the device. A diagram can also be a complex drawing, like an engineering plan for airplanes. When you make a line drawing of your own, you can use diagram as a verb, as when you diagram a sentence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2588,"<ul><li>A ferry is a boat that carries people, cars, and cargo back and forth across a body of water. The Staten Island Ferry ferries commuters from Manhattan to Staten Island every ten minutes during rush hour.</li><li>To ferry means to transport by ferry, or to transport in other ferry-like ways, i.e., multiple short trips. If you have an ice-skating birthday party, your dad might ferry a few van loads of kids back to your house afterward, for pizza and cake.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2589,"<ul><li>Someone who's handy is skilled and clever, especially when it comes to making or fixing things. If you're handy in the kitchen, you're a good cook.</li><li>A carpenter tends to be handy with a saw or a hammer, and if you're good at sewing, you're handy with a needle and thread. Another meaning of handy is ""useful"" or ""convenient."" Your laptop is handy because you use it for all kinds of things, and your smartphone is handy because you always keep it in your pocket — it's right there when you need it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2590,"<ul><li>When you remove or set apart one thing from others, you isolate it. You could isolate yourself  from people by living in a remote hut or, if you're a biologist, you could isolate a chromosome.</li><li>The verb isolate comes from the adjective isolated, which comes from the Latin insulatas, meaning “made into an island.” You may have heard the John Donne quote, “No man is an island.” Donne was claiming that no matter how much you might try to isolate yourself from the rest of humanity, in the end people are all connected to one another. Humanity’s need for connectedness may, in fact, be illustrated by the fact that jailers frequently isolate criminals as punishment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2591,"<ul><li>A longing is a strong feeling of need or desire for someone or something. If you're stuck in detention and all of your friends are outside enjoying a sunny day, you might be looking out the window with longing.</li><li>A longing describes an unfulfilled desire. The days might feel long as long as you are longing to see someone you love, if that person is far away. You might be longing for your mother's home-made chicken soup, if you are sick and far from home. Or perhaps you are a pregnant woman, wide awake and longing for pickles and ice-cream at four in the morning. Let's hope there's a twenty-four hour deli open somewhere to help satisfy your longing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2592,"<ul><li>Numerous means very large in quantity. You wouldn’t use numerous to describe how many feet you have (just two), but you could use it to describe the infinite number of shoes in your closet.</li><li>The adjective numerous is related to the word number — which is no big surprise since it basically means ""a large number of something."" Use numerous to describe a copious or abundant amount that you can't give a specific number for. Numerous fans probably come out for the all-star game, for example. And numerous players wish they made the all-star team.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2593,"<ul><li>A particle is a small piece of anything. Particle can also refer to a subatomic particle with mass and structure, but takes up hardly any space at all.</li><li>Particles are tiny. If you mean a subatomic particle, that's a body that you can't see because it is so incredibly small, though it does have a miniscule mass and internal structure. These particles are even smaller than atoms. You can also say a crumb or speck of something is a particle. Dust particles are piling up all the time, and vacuuming cleans up lots of particles. Those particles are little bits of things. In both cases, particles are very tiny.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2594,"<ul><li>A plea is what you make when you're begging for something with a sense of urgency and emotion. While you wouldn't call asking for a hall pass a plea, you could make a plea for justice or world peace.</li><li>Plea also has a legal meaning. When you get a traffic ticket or if you're accused of a crime, you have to enter a plea of ""guilty"" or ""not guilty."" A ""plea bargain"" is when you make a deal with the prosecutor — you may plead guilty to a charge (by entering a guilty plea) that has less of a penalty and, in return, the prosecutor drops the more serious charge.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2595,"<ul><li>When someone burps in a quiet classroom it can be hard to refrain from laughing. Use the verb refrain if you have a sudden impulse to do something and you have stopped yourself from doing it.</li><li>It's usually hard to refrain from doing something: you might find it difficult to refrain from eating dessert after dinner, for example — especially when your aunt makes her double chocolate chunk brownies. The Latin word refrēnāre is formed from the prefix re-, ""back,"" plus frēnāre, ""to hold a horse back with a bridle."" No need to hold back when using refrain as a noun; it’s the part of a song or poem that repeats.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2596,"<ul><li>To review means to look back over something for evaluation or memory. ""The year in review"" is a popular form of news feature near the end of December.</li><li>If your boss wants to give you a review, she wants to look over the history of your job performance. A doctor might review your medical record to help diagnose your sickness. The review of a book or movie often evaluates the work in question based on its strong and weak points, sometimes ending with a recommendation (or a dismissal). Before a big test, you might want to review (""brush up on"") your notes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2597,"<ul><li>If something is sophisticated, it's complicated and intricate. The inner workings of a computer are sophisticated. Sophisticated can also refer to having good taste. Either way, sophisticated things are impressive.</li><li>Sophisticated systems and objects are complex and tough to understand. High school math is a lot more sophisticated than grammar school math. Driving a car is more sophisticated than riding a bike. People are sophisticated if they have plenty of worldly experience and what is generally regarded as ""good taste."" Sometimes, that just means they have a lot of money and like things that are fancy. Going to a symphony is considered more sophisticated than going to a rock concert.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2598,"<ul><li>To surrender is to give up control of something to someone else. If you miss curfew, your parents might make you surrender the keys to the car. Okay, it's only a minivan, but it's still cooler than being on foot patrol.</li><li>If you want someone to give up, you might order them to surrender. The witch in the Wizard of Oz wrote ""Surrender Dorothy!"" in the sky above the Emerald City. You can use the noun surrender when you give up on a task. For example, if you are cleaning the house, but every time you finish a room, the kids mess up another, you can throw your hands up and declare, ""I surrender!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2599,"<ul><li>Something that's upright stands straight up. When you sit upright, your back is straight and vertical. Even your grandmother would approve of your posture.</li><li>Most cars have seats that can fold forward or lean back, and then snap upright, back into a normal sitting position; and when you're in class, you're usually expected to sit upright, facing your teacher at the front of the room. Another way to use upright is to mean ""upstanding"" or ""trustworthy,"" so if your friend finds a wallet full of money and returns it to its owner, you can call her an upright citizen.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U10_2600,"<ul><li>Things that are worthwhile are good — they're worth the time or money you spend on them.</li><li>If you walked out of the theater and said ""Wow, I'm glad I saw that movie!"", then your film viewing trip was worthwhile. If going to the gym helped you get in better shape, it was worthwhile. If hanging out in the park made you happy, it was worthwhile. If something is a total waste of time and you wish you hadn't done it, then it wasn't worthwhile.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2601,"<ul><li>Countries that have an alliance, or agreement, help each other out when in need. That means during times of war, for example, if two countries have an alliance, one will help the other by providing weapons and supplies.</li><li>An alliance doesn't just have to be between two countries; you can see alliances formed on a playground, when kids start clustering in groups or dividing themselves into teams to play tag. An alliance is essentially a connection through which a common interest is shared. A marriage is an alliance between two people who decide to share their lives together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2602,"<ul><li>After a theatrical performance, audience members typically use applause, or hand-clapping, to express their approval. (Of course, sometimes applause just means the audience is glad it’s time to go home.)</li><li>Back in ancient Rome, actors requested applause from the audience by declaring “Plaudite!” This fact sheds light on the origin of applause — and it definitively proves that performers have been seeking approval from audiences for millennia. Oddly enough, however, it’s considered inappropriate to applaud between the movements of a piece of classical music, regardless of how much you enjoyed the performance. Some concertgoers choose to defy this rule, in spite of the nasty looks they get from neighbors.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2603,"<ul><li>If you're armed, you are carrying some kind of weapon. Armed soldiers are most commonly supplied with guns.</li><li>In the United States, police officers are almost always armed, while British police usually don't carry guns. When a crime involves the use of a weapon, it might be described as an armed robbery, and even an animal is sometimes said to be armed: ""The cat was armed with sharp teeth and claws against the puppy's enthusiasm."" The Latin root is arma, ""weapons,"" or ""tools of war.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2604,"<ul><li>Speak with an authoritative tone, or no one will listen to you. Why would they, if you sound like you don't even believe in yourself? Authoritative means sure or definitive.</li><li>When writing a paper, it can be useful to quote from an authoritative source, such as the encyclopedia, but you must also do enough research that you are fluent in your subject and can speak with the authoritative voice only true immersion can produce.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2605,"<ul><li>Bravery is the admirable quality of being able to confront frightening things. It takes bravery for a knight to battle a dragon, but it also takes bravery for a shy child to walk into a new classroom.</li><li>You can also call bravery courage or valor. Firefighters are often acknowledged for their bravery, but everyday people also act with bravery if they confront their fears. Even though you're scared when you jump out of the plane with your skydiving instructor, the fact that you're doing it at all takes real bravery. It also takes bravery to pet a friend's German shepherd, especially if you are afraid of dogs. The earliest meaning of bravery was closer to bravado: ""daring, defiance, and boasting.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2606,"<ul><li>A ceremony is a formal event held on special occasions such as weddings and graduations.  Even if an occasion isn’t traditionally honored with a ceremony, you can hold one anyway; we know your cat’s third birthday is important.</li><li>Ceremony can also refer to proper, formal behavior; someone who insists on behaving properly can be said to “stand on ceremony.” If you insist on standing up and shaking hands every time you’re introduced to someone, you're a person who stands on ceremony. If you prefer to sit back and offer a casual “Hey,” you're a person who acts “without ceremony.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2607,"<ul><li>A culture is a specific group of people during a particular time — like the hippie culture of the 1960's. Culture can also imply exposure to the arts. Visit a museum if you are in need of a dose of culture.</li><li>A useful thing to remember about culture is that it is closely related to cultivate, whose root meaning is ""to till the soil."" Even in Latin, the source language, cultura was used metaphorically (Cicero said philosophy was cultura animi, the ""cultivation of the soul""), and in English it moved from the agricultural sense to training, development of language and literature, mental development through education, and finally the ideas, customs, and intellectual and artistic conditions of a society or group.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2608,"<ul><li>Defense has to do with protecting something or fighting against an opponent, whether it's national defense, a football team's defense, or a defense lawyer.</li><li>Defense is the opposite of offense. It has to do with defending against all sorts of things: In the military, defense is about protecting a country from attack. In sports, defense is supposed to stop the other team from scoring. A defense attorney tries to prove his client is innocent. A defense can even be an excuse for doing something, as in ""In my own defense, I was sleepwalking at the time.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2609,"<ul><li>A detail is a small fact or spot in a larger entity. That ambiguous smile is just one detail of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.</li><li>Detail comes from the French for cutting into pieces, but in English we only use it to refer to the pieces. As a noun, detail means an isolated aspect of something larger. If you're painting a landscape, don't forget details like individual birds and trees. Detail can also mean a team of workers for a special task. If you go on a group camping trip, try for the food detail instead of the trash detail.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2610,"<ul><li>A diverse group is made up of people or things that are very different from each other. If your class mixes kids from all over the world, you could call it diverse.</li><li>The adjective diversified has the same meaning, and a near synonym is varied. An earlier spelling of the English adjective was divers, and the final –e was probably added by association with words such as traverse and converse. The word divers is still in use in the sense ""more than one, several, various:"" divers methods and styles.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2611,"<ul><li>To enchant is to cast a spell over someone, like a witch might do. It also means to attract or catch someone's attention in a less mystical way.</li><li>Enchanting has a few meanings, but they all involve seduction. A witch or warlock enchants people they wish to influence through magic spells. A real person enchants in different ways: through jokes, good looks, and charisma. Not only people, but also engrossing songs or shows can be said ""to enchant.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2612,"<ul><li>To equip means to provide something needed for a particular purpose. If you’re planning a trip to the Arctic, you should equip yourself with warm clothes, tents, and two-way radios.</li><li>You might want to equip someone with an ice axe for ice climbing and a diving watch for underwater excursions. The ice axe or the diving watch is their equipment. Equip can also be used in a more figurative sense. If you are supposed to write computer programs but have never worked with a computer, you might say that you are not equipped for that. On a really bad day, it might feel like people are not equipped to deal with each other politely.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2613,"<ul><li>An exception is something that is left out or not done on purpose. An exception to a rule does not follow that rule.</li><li>This word is used for all sorts of things that are not usual or usually allowed. The saying ”i before e except after c,” is about an exception to a spelling rule. If you run every day but take Saturdays off, you're making an exception. If your teacher punishes you for being late even though you have an excuse, she might say, ""I'm sorry, but I can't make an exception."" When you see exception, think ""Something different than usual is happening.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2614,"<ul><li>A genre is a specific type of music, film, or writing. Your favorite literary genre might be science fiction, and your favorite film genre might be horror flicks about cheerleaders. Go figure.</li><li>In music, genre refers to musical style such as jazz, salsa or rock. In film or literature, the genre is determined by the subject, setting or plot of the story. When you are wandering around a book store, books are usually arranged by genre. Many genres, such as ""mystery"" or ""fantasy,"" overlap in film and literature, while others, such as ""romantic comedy"" in film or ""historical fiction"" in books, are specific to one or the other.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2615,"<ul><li>The noun impact can refer to a physical force (like a collision), an influence (a bad role model or a hero), or a strong effect (a foot of snow will have an impact on driving conditions).</li><li>Impact is used most often as a noun. A good teacher might have an impact (influence) on a struggling student. The moment two comets collide is called the ""moment of impact."" But this versatile word can also be used as a verb, though many people prefer to use its synonyms instead: ""affect,"" ""bear upon,"" or ""touch on."" Impacted teeth are wedged together or stuck behind each other.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2616,"<ul><li>To lure is to entice or bait someone.  A lure is used to bait or entice fish to attach themselves to your hook.  ""He had a new shiny lure, which was enough to lure me into going on the fishing trip.""</li><li>The verb lure is related to words that mean “bait,” “deceit,” and “invite.”  Often, when lure is used, there is a nefarious implication, as in: “He was able to lure her into the alley, but her friends soon came looking for her.”  The noun lure is the thing that draws in the person or animal, which can be either a physical object or a concept.  ""The lure of his great wealth kept her in the relationship despite his infidelity.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2617,"<ul><li>When the road is blocked ahead of you, that blockage is an obstacle that keeps you from getting where you want to go.</li><li>The Latin word that is the source of the word obstacle combines parts that mean ""to stand in the way of,"" so an obstacle is something that stands against what you want to do. In a dramatic piece, the obstacle is the person or thing that keeps a character from achieving his or her goal. This creates the conflict in a play: since conflict is what drama is all about, the obstacle is the source of all drama.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2618,"<ul><li>Shelter is one of the basic human needs along with food, water, and companionship. It is a structure that protects you from the elements and gives you a place to live.</li><li>If you get lost in the woods during a rain storm, the first thing you should do is seek shelter, or a protected place to stay. A shelter is also a place to go for help, e.g. a homeless shelter is for those with nowhere to sleep, a bomb shelter protects people in a war zone and an animal shelter houses dogs and cats without a home. You've probably heard people talking about tax shelters, which are investments that protect your money from being taxed by the government.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2619,"<ul><li>To supply the definition of a word is to provide that definition. That's supply used as a verb. If you're talking about the noun, however, then the supply is the thing itself.</li><li>People who think the world is coming to an end generally like to keep a supply of fresh water on hand. Though, if the world did come to an end, you wouldn't need to supply water to anyone, would you? That's a case of supplying a supply.

If there is a big enough demand for ping-pong balls, a person could get rich, if they controlled the supply. Having to supply all those balls could be exhausting, though.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U11_2620,"<ul><li>If you spend all day admiring yourself in reflective surfaces — mirrors, pools of water, the backs of spoons — people may think you are conceited, or vain.</li><li>Vain is from Latin vanus, ""empty,"" and in English it originally meant ""lacking value or effect, futile,"" like your vain attempt to find a pencil in your messy, overstuffed backpack. Likewise, the phrase ""in vain"" means ""without success."" Vain also means ""conceited, too proud of oneself.""  Carly Simon's line ""You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you"" is an excellent illustration of this use.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2621,"<ul><li>When you're facing a fork in the road, you have two possibilities, or alternatives. You could take the left fork and see where it leads, or you could choose the path that goes to the right.</li><li>Whenever there is an alternative, it involves a choice. A wealthy student has the choice of going to a public school, or the alternative, a private school. Alternative can also refer to a different way of doing things, outside the norm. You might say that a hermit who lives in remote a cave with a pet turtle is living an alternative lifestyle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2622,"<ul><li>An avenue is a street, especially a wide one lined with trees. An avenue is also any approach to doing something. For example, this web site might be a new avenue you have found for learning words.</li><li>The word avenue comes from the French avenir, meaning ""to come to, or arrive."" The first meaning is simply a wide street. An avenue — or boulevard — is likely to be busy, unlike a quiet side street. The abbreviation is ave., as in Park Ave. Also, an avenue is a way to accomplish something. If you need money but can't get a loan, you'll have to find another avenue.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2623,"<ul><li>Your belly is your stomach. If you have a belly ache, you have a pain in your abdomen.</li><li>Santa Claus is famous for his jolly laugh and his large belly. The word belly is a more casual way to say ""stomach"" or ""abdomen,"" just as your navel is informally called a ""belly button."" A less common way to use the word is as a verb meaning ""to swell,"" which is actually the oldest meaning of belly, from the Old English belig, ""bag,"" and a Germanic root meaning ""to swell like a bag.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2624,"<ul><li>If you make the winning bid on an item, you offer the highest price and get to take it home.  Congratulations, and enjoy your new paper weight!</li><li>Bid comes from an Old English word meaning “to offer,” which is right in line with its meaning today. To bid is the act of offering a bid, or more generally to try to get something. With several companies bidding for your services, you have a lot to consider. Tip: go where the weather's warmest.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2625,"<ul><li>To blow is to create a burst or puff of air. When chilly breezes start to blow, it's time to close your windows.</li><li>People blow candles out on birthday cakes and blow up balloons — a person blows by directing a flow of air from the mouth in a steady stream. When the wind blows, an air current moves. Another way to blow something is to burst, break, or ruin it: ""If I drive over that broken glass, I'll blow a tire,"" or ""I just know I'm going to blow my audition."" You can also blow money, by wasting or squandering it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2626,"<ul><li>A conflict is a struggle or an opposition. If you and your best friend both fall in love with the same person, you will have to find some way to resolve the conflict.</li><li>Conflict comes from the Latin word for striking, but it isn't always violent. Conflict can arise from opposing ideas. If you want to turn your empty lot into a community garden but your wife envisions a shooting range, you have a conflict. If you're torn between two different desires, you're conflicted. Conflict can also be a verb. If you schedule a dentist appointment that conflicts with a meeting, you'll have to cancel one of them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2627,"<ul><li>A continent is one of the seven largest landmasses found on Earth. Asia, Australia, and Africa are three continents. Can you name the other four?</li><li>Some folks forget the continent of Antarctica, because so few humans live there—none of them permanently. And you might be surprised how many people think that Africa is a country and not a continent. Due to a process known as continental drift, the extremely slow movement of the continents across the face of the globe, our world looks very different from the way it did 100 million years ago.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2628,"<ul><li>If it's in the past, it's not current. If it's out of date, out of style, or out of time, it's not current. If it's up-to-the-minute, right now, and in the present, it is current.</li><li>Origins of the word current all point to the meaning ""present."" Things that are current are happening now; they are part of the present time. News reporting looks at ""current affairs"" because past affairs are no longer news; they are history. Expressions like ""staying current"" or ""keeping up with current events"" show a need or desire to know what's popular, important, or relevant now. As a noun, a current can be a flow of water, electricity, or ideas.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2629,"<ul><li>To disrespect someone is to act in an insulting way toward them. When you disrespect people, you think very little of them.</li><li>Disrespect is all about not showing respect. Actually, it's about showing the opposite of respect, by acting rude, impolite, and offensive. Talking back to your teacher is showing disrespect for her authority. Not giving up your seat to an elderly person is an act of disrespect. So is ignoring the customs and culture in a foreign country. The slang abbreviation dis comes from disrespect and means the same thing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2630,"<ul><li>You might show enthusiasm if you find out that all the shoes are on sale for 70 percent off today. The word enthusiasm indicates intense excitement.</li><li>The noun enthusiasm comes from the Greek word enthousiasmos, from enthous, meaning “possessed by a god, inspired.” It was originally used in a derogatory sense to describe excessive religious zeal. Today both the religious and derogatory connotations are gone from enthusiasm, but the zeal has survived. Use it to describe great excitement or interest, like what you feel when you’re doing something that you really, really enjoy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2631,"<ul><li>Harsh means severe or strict, particularly when referring to punishment. It would be a harsh punishment if you got grounded for two weeks just for coming home a little late for dinner.</li><li>There are many shades of meaning for the word harsh depending on its context, but all imply that something is more unpleasant than it needs to be. Harsh lighting hurts your eyes. A harsh disciplinarian gives out punishments that are too severe. Whereas constructive criticism is usually helpful, a harsh critique will only make you upset. The harsh reality of the world today is that millions of people are starving while others have too much.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2632,"<ul><li>If you lean on something, you incline your body against it, like the way you lean against a wall while waiting in line. If you lean on a person, you rely on her for moral support, like the way you lean on your best friend when you're feeling sad or worried.</li><li>If you’re tired, lean back in your chair. If you’re broke, lean on your family for financial help. But something can lean all by itself, if it’s not standing straight. The famous Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of about 4 degrees. As an adjective, we use lean to describe something skimpy or lacking excess flesh. When you're experiencing financial difficulty, you could say you're going through lean (not prosperous) times.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2633,"<ul><li>The meantime is the time between two events. You might be waiting for the second half of a soccer game to begin, and in the meantime call your best friend to tell her the score.</li><li>You'll most often see the word meantime in the phrase ""in the meantime,"" and it can be used in a similar way to meanwhile. You could say, ""I have to go to the store soon. In the meantime, I'm playing with the dog."" This word has been around since the fourteenth century, although it was originally two separate words, mean time. Its root is the word mean, which means ""middle or intermediate.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2634,"<ul><li>People who pull pranks, make jokes, and do things that annoy other people — but aren't really awful — are good at mischief.</li><li>Mischief is a word for things that are a little bad or reckless but ultimately harmless. Hitting someone with a spitball is mischief. Hitting them with a rock is dangerous and therefore much worse than mischief. Making mischief can be fun, as long as it doesn't get out of hand. People who do a lot of mischief are called ""mischievous.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2635,"<ul><li>Do you have the muscle to muscle your way to the top? Muscle is both a noun and verb associated with strength, power, or the use of physical force.</li><li>In addition to biological muscle, like the biceps in your arms, muscle can refer simply to power or authority, as in “We have the  muscle to get the job done.” Muscle can also refer to a hired thug. In a similar sense, muscle is used as a verb to mean “use force.” A bully might muscle someone out of their lunch money, or you might muscle your way through a crowd by pushing people out of your way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2636,"<ul><li>When you rescue something, you save it from something bad — you come to the rescue. If Muffin, your kitten, is stuck in a tree, you can get out your ladder and climb up to rescue her.</li><li>A rescue is a good thing, much appreciated by people (and kittens). If your house is in foreclosure, you'd be very grateful for the uncle who comes to your rescue by paying your mortgage. Whenever there's an earthquake or other disaster, rescue operations are quickly put in place to find survivors. You can use the word more casually, as in describing how you saunter over at a cocktail party and rescue your friend from a conversation with an insufferable bore.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2637,"<ul><li>Use the word succession to describe things that follow one another, as well as the order in which they do so. The Vice President is first in line of succession to be the President and the Secretary of State is fourth.</li><li>Sometimes when a leader dies, the one who rules after him is determined not by law as in the U.S. or blood as in a monarchy but by the dying leader himself. Dictators often groom one of their sons for succession. Figuratively, you can use succession to indicate that one thing after another has come and gone without taking hold. The storefront has been home to a succession of businesses, all of which have failed. Fashions come and go in quick succession.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2638,"<ul><li>An ATV, or all-terrain vehicle, is useful for people who drive on lots of different terrain, hence the name. Terrain is a noun used to talk about the ground, when you're specifically interested in how it appears or is shaped.</li><li>In times of war, you'll often hear the term ""hostile terrain"" used to describe a region with lots of mountains, vast stretches of desert, or impenetrable jungles. These are all areas of difficult terrain that are hard to pass. Much of humankind's history can be traced by its effort to alter the terrain. We've made mountains into meadows, rivers into lakes, and prairies into roads, all to make the terrain more livable for us. You could even go so far as to say that a person's psyche is mysterious terrain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2639,"<ul><li>Timid means ""overly cautious or fearful,"" like a timid driver who drives very slowly or avoids highways altogether.</li><li>Timid comes from the Middle French word timide, meaning ""easily frightened, shy."" Those who are timid often worry that things will go wrong: a timid eater orders bland food to avoid the possibility not liking the flavor of something new, just as a timid partygoer talks to people he already knows, afraid that he won't be able to talk to strangers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U12_2640,"<ul><li>Violence is aggression, usually physical aggression that causes harm. Beating someone up and attacking a defenseless village are both forms of violence.</li><li>From wars and acts of terrorism to bar brawls, violence is unfortunately very common in the world — and when there's violence, people get hurt. But you'll see a lot of organized violence and acts of aggression in sports: boxing and football are extremely violent, which is why people who play those sports get so many injuries. We can also say that something powerful or wild happens with violence, like a destructive tornado.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2641,"<ul><li>Affect is most often used as a verb meaning “to have an impact on,” as in “The tornado barreling towards us will affect our picnic plans.”</li><li>As a verb, affect can also mean “to feign an appearance,” as in, “Don’t let that surfer’s California accent fool you. Although she affects a convincing ‘Dude, that was rad,’ she is from Minnesota and just moved out West last month.” Don’t let that affect your friendship, though, she’s probably really fun.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2642,"<ul><li>If you sign your name on something, you autograph it. You have to autograph a check before it can be cashed.</li><li>An autograph is a signature. Famous people are asked for their autographs all the time, but you might be surprised and flattered if a little girl asked for yours after you played Dorothy in your community theater production of ""The Wizard of Oz."" An original manuscript or musical composition written in the handwriting of the author or composer is also called an autograph. In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art displayed an autograph of Mark Twain's ""Tom Sawyer.""</li></ul>"

You can make your own jewelry by stringing colorful beads on a long cord.</li><li>Beads are decorative balls made from stone, glass, or plastic. Rosary beads — or other prayer beads — are used for praying or meditating, and in some societies beads are the equivalent of money, used as currency to buy things. You can also describe a round drop of liquid as a bead, like a bead of sweat on your forehead. The earliest meaning of bead is ""prayer bead,"" from the Old English gebed, ""prayer.""</li></ul>"

To charm someone is to attract them.</li><li>There are several types of charms, but they mostly relate to attraction and good luck. A lucky coin is a charm. The spell of a witch that entrances you is a charm. People with magnetic personalities, who make you want to hang out with them, have charm and are therefore considered charming. Also, to charm someone is to attract them and win them over. Popular politicians charm the masses, and teachers' pets charm their teachers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2646,"<ul><li>Destiny is what's meant to be, what's written in the stars, your inescapable fate. You might think it's your destiny to own a dog, but your sad goldfish survival rate should tell you that happy pets probably aren't in your future.</li><li>A noun meaning fate, destiny is synonymous with other nouns like divine decree, fortune, and serendipity. There's no avoiding destiny — it's going to happen no matter what you do. But before you get bogged down worrying about what the distant future holds, remember what Winston Churchill said: “It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link in the chain of destiny can be handled at a time.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2647,"<ul><li>A motherboard and a graphics processor? Duct tape? A circular saw? A solar panel? Depending on what you’re up to, all these things can be considered equipment, which is whatever you need to complete a task.</li><li>Right away you probably notice that a big chunk of the word equipment is made up of another word, the common verb equip — meaning ""to provide someone with the tools they need for a specific task."" Add equip to -ment (the suffix of choice when you want to turn a verb into a noun) and voilà! Like magic, the verb changes into a noun, and you end up with equipment: the materials you get when you are equipped to do a particular thing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2648,"<ul><li>A horn is an instrument that's made of metal and is played by blowing into it. Another type of horn comes out of an animal's head. Don't confuse the two and imagine a trombone sticking out of a water buffalo's head.</li><li>A trumpet is one kind of horn, and another is a silly plastic noisemaker that produces a loud, honking sound. You might blow this horn at a New Year's party or a football game. Your car has a horn too, that you use to warn other drivers of your presence or express your annoyance. The horns that animals have are hard, bony bumps or projections on their heads — you'll see them on goats and bulls, for example.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2649,"<ul><li>If you're feeling on edge, like the smallest thing could bother you or make you lose your temper, you are irritable.  Did I say something wrong?</li><li>Irritable means ""easy to irritate or bother."" If you have irritable skin, you get a rash from just about anything. An irritable person is not easy-going and often not very easy to be around.  You might feel like you're ""walking on eggshells,"" or being extra careful not to upset your brother when he's in an irritable mood.  Is there anything I can do to make you less irritable?  Fetch your favorite blanket?  Maybe I'll just go away now.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2650,"<ul><li>When you can't keep up with your fellow marathon runners, you can say that you lag behind them.</li><li>The word lag describes a kind of slowness or delay. As a noun, it means a slowing: ""The coach was disappointed by the lag in her swimmers' best times that day."" When you lag behind someone, you fall back or don't measure up. A student who struggles with math, for example, might say that his grades lag behind his best friend's. In the 1550s, lag meant ""last person.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2651,"<ul><li>If you wake with a start after a terrifying dream, you've had a nightmare.</li><li>A nightmare is not just a bad dream — it's seriously scary or upsetting. You can also use nightmare to describe something terrible that happens during the day. Your run-in with a skunk in your back yard might be a nightmare, for example, or your humiliating experience forgetting your lines in a play. In the late thirteenth century, a nightmare was ""an evil female spirit afflicting sleepers with a feeling of suffocation,"" from the Old English word mare, ""incubus or goblin.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2652,"<ul><li>Nutritious describes food that's good for you. Brown rice and kale are nutritious, but jelly beans, sadly, are not.</li><li>Something that provides nutrients — vitamins, minerals, and protein, for example — is nutritious. Our bodies need nutritious food to grow, heal, and stay healthy, however much we might crave tasty, non-nutritious snacks. The adjective nutritious comes from the Latin word nutritius, ""that nourishes,"" which in turn comes from the root nutrix, ""nurse.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2653,"<ul><li>Protein makes up your nails, your hair, and the egg on your plate. This nitrogenous substance we call protein consists of chains of amino acids and is necessary for life functions.</li><li>The linguistic origins of protein — from the Greek proteios, meaning “first place” or “primary” — are fitting for a substance that is one of life’s chief components. Although protein is a word often heard in labs and biology classes, it has everyday context too, particularly in the kitchen. Protein-rich foods like eggs, cheese, meats, peanuts or beans are an essential part of good nutrition.</li></ul>"

Things you can put your signature on include checks, permission slips, letters, stays of execution, and declarations of independence.</li><li>Signature isn't just about signing your name on the dotted line. A characteristic mark, tune, or style is also called a signature. Perhaps you have a favorite outfit or style that you consider your signature look. ""I Did It My Way"" was a signature tune of Frank Sinatra. In music, the signature indicates what key the song is set in by showing the sharps and flats.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2655,"<ul><li>""Good stuff!"" you might say, tasting a delicious piece of cake.  The word stuff could refer to all sorts of things. It's one of those words that you can use when you're too lazy to find the right word.</li><li>Stuff is one of those words you use in all kinds of contexts, or for all kinds of stuff.  When you throw a bunch of stuff into a bag, you could be referring to any arrangement of things. When you talk about someone's possessions, informally, you're talking about his stuff. As a verb, to stuff something, is to fill it up — like when you stuff a turkey with breadcrumbs or stuff a pillow with... stuffing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2656,"<ul><li>Subconscious describes something that is just below your awareness, like at a subconscious level hoping your friend's boyfriend breaks up with her — you didn't even realize you felt that way until it happened.</li><li>If you are aware of something, you are conscious of it, like being conscious of your tendency to talk too much when you are nervous: you watch for it and try to control it. Most words that start with the prefix sub- are something “under” the root word: something subconscious is under or below your awareness. Maybe in time, it will surface — you might get to the root of why you get so nervous in the first place.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2657,"<ul><li>A van is a roomy vehicle with a boxy shape that's useful for transporting extra people or extra stuff. If you're moving some furniture across town, your mom's van will come in handy.</li><li>There are many kinds of vans, from commercial vans that deliver appliances to airport vans that transport hotel guests and their luggage to the small vans parked in many suburban driveways. A less common meaning of van is ""forefront,"" and this meaning is usually used when talking about military movement: ""The general was at the van of the troops as they surged forward."" The vehicle definition comes from caravan, ""large covered carriage used for conveying passengers.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2658,"<ul><li>When you warn someone, you advise them to be careful or tell them about a problem or danger. If you perform a dangerous stunt, you should probably warn your audience, ""Don't try this at home.""</li><li>Many traffic signs are meant to warn drivers about hazards, like bridges that get slippery in the rain or bumps in the road. And the purpose of a dog's growl is to warn another dog (or human) that it's stressed or fearful. A warning is a helpful message, no matter what form it comes in, and to warn is to send this message. The Old English root is warnian, ""give notice of impending danger.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2659,"<ul><li>A workout is an exercise session. If you hope to join your school's track team, you'd better be prepared for regular workouts.</li><li>If you do yoga, lift weights, or run with your dog, you can call each of these activities a workout. When it's a verb, workout becomes two separate words: work out. So you can either say ""I work out three days a week"" or ""I usually do three workouts a week."" When this noun first appeared around the turn of the 20th century, it referred specifically to a practice boxing match.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U13_2660,"<ul><li>Zoom zoom! This is a word for things moving quickly, either up or in a line. When you hear zoom, think fast.</li><li>Zoom is a word that can be a sound effect, a noun, or a verb. In comic books, you might see a spaceship taking off with a word bubble saying ZOOM!. Fast cars can zoom; airplanes can zoom. You could say, ""In one zoom, we were in the air!"" Zooming can also mean to move while making a low humming noise that sounds like zoom. Like boom, zoom is a fun word: it's hard to say Zoom zoom! and be in a bad mood.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B05_U14_2662,"<ul><li>To crumble is to come apart into tiny pieces. If the doughnuts you bring to work crumble before you get there, you co-workers will have nothing but crumbs to snack on.</li><li>Baked goods seem to crumble easily, but other things tend to crumble too: old houses, over time; sand castles; fragile ruins; and art objects made from clay. Anything that falls apart, especially into small bits, can be said to crumble. The root of the word is the Old English gecrymman, ""to break into crumbs,"" which in turn comes from cruma, ""crumb or fragment.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2663,"<ul><li>Dough is a thick mixture of flour and other ingredients that can be kneaded, baked, and eaten. Bread dough needs to rise before you bake it in a hot oven.</li><li>Many baked goods begin their lives as dough, including bread, rolls, and some cookies. Dough is stiff enough that you can shape it, pull pieces off of it, stretch it and knead it. Informally, dough can also mean ""money."" If your friend says, ""I make so much dough waiting tables!"" he probably means money, not cookie dough. The word comes from an Indo-European root that means ""smear"" or ""knead.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2664,"<ul><li>When something goes fast, it goes express — like a train that skips many stops. You also express your feelings and thoughts.</li><li>When you want something sent quickly, send it by express mail. When you give your opinion, you're expressing yourself. Writing music and poems are also examples of expressing yourself. Mathematical formulas express complex ideas. In genetics, a gene might be expressed by making you bald.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2665,"<ul><li>Want to hit a punching bag? First you need  to curl your fingers into your palm to make a fist, or a clenched hand.</li><li>You might make a fist and bump it against your friend's as a greeting, or use it to clutch something tightly: ""She held the balloon in one fist, and an ice cream cone in the other."" Fists are also used to punch hard, and a fist fight is a serious physical altercation. When we trace this word back to its origin, we find a closely related root meaning ""five,"" for the five fingers of a hand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2666,"<ul><li>Something that is flexible is easily bent without breaking. The flexible drinking straw was invented in the 1930s by a man who saw his daughter struggling to drink a milkshake with a straight paper straw.</li><li>The word flexible can refer to bendable physical objects or to intangibles like a person's mind, which can be changed. It can even refer to work environments that can adapt schedules and benefits to fit a worker's individual needs. Being physically flexible usually means good health, with no pain in movement. In all, it's great to be flexible, to be able to bend without breaking and bounce back, ready to keep going.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2667,"<ul><li>When you empty something out with a liquid, you flush it. You might also be flush with cash, meaning you have a lot of it. Just don't flush that cash down the toilet!</li><li>Your face can flush, and the sky can flush at sunset when it glows with shades of pink. You can also use flush as an adjective to mean ""lined up"" or ""level,"" like when you hang a medicine cabinet in your bathroom, making sure it's flush against the wall. Yet another meaning of a flush is a peak or boom — a professional poker player might describe her period of winning game after game as a flush.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2668,"<ul><li>Injure means to hurt, physically or mentally. Lose a bet and you might injure or bruise your pride, but lose your footing and you could injure your body instead.</li><li>When a player in a sport is injured, they leave the field to be examined by a trainer or a physician, to see how severe their injury really is. If you slip and fall on the ice, your mom might say, ""Are you injured?"" She doesn't mean a bruise–––she's talking about a broken bone or a sprained ankle. You can also injure or wound someone else. Insult your mother's cooking or tackle your little brother too roughly to the ground and you'll injure them, either emotionally or physically.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2669,"<ul><li>If it's hard to determine its shape and otherwise looks like a big blob of something, it's probably safe to call it a lump.</li><li>Jabba the Hut looks like a disgusting lump. So does the growing mound on your noggin where you walked into the glass door. And if you've been lumped together with a bad bunch, you might have been grouped with people indiscriminately. But all lumps aren't bad. Little old ladies put lumps of sugar into their tea. And that choked up feeling you get during a sappy movie? That's just a lump in your throat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2670,"<ul><li>A mixture is, simply, the product of mixing. Sometimes, like in the case of ice cream with fudge, a mixture can turn out delicious. At other times, though, like with oil and water, a mixture just fails to jive.</li><li>A mixture is a concoction of several parts combined. In chemistry, it describes a composition made up of two or more substances that can be separated. When it comes to textiles, mixture describes fabric that consists of various yarn or materials. Note the difference between mix and mixture, though. Elements in a mix retain their unique parts even though they have been thrown together. In a mixture, elements are blended in such a way that they forfeit their individuality.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2671,"<ul><li>Reach for the verb reconcile to make different things come together or resolve a matter.</li><li>If you've ever had an argument with someone and then made up, you have reconciled. Reconcile is a verb that can mean ""to become resigned"" like if you're reconciled to getting the bottom bunk when you wanted the top. It also means to ""bring into agreement and harmony."" Words like it are pacify, harmonize, and accommodate — reconcile is definitely an agreeable word!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2672,"<ul><li>To ruin means to wreck or destroy. If you're wearing a long dress, make sure your clumsy brother stays away from you. If he steps on it, it'll rip and be ruined.</li><li>Bad news always ruins your day and a guest's bad behavior can really ruin a party and all your fun! Be careful when adding salt to your food — too much will ruin it. Often you will see ruin used as a noun that means the state of ruin, the action that causes it or the destruction itself. If you are a ruin of your former self, you're in pretty bad shape. Use ruins for the remains of old castles and Roman structures.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2673,"<ul><li>When you shatter something, you smash it or break it into small bits. If your sister hits a baseball directly into the kitchen window, the window will shatter — and your sister will be in big trouble.</li><li>When you drop something fragile, it will probably shatter—lightbulbs, teacups, mirrors, and windows all shatter fairly easily. Things can also shatter in a less literal way, when it just feels like they're breaking apart violently. If your best friend ignores you all day, your heart shatters; and if you stumble and fall on your way up to a podium to give a speech, your confidence may shatter.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2674,
4000EEW_B05_U14_2675,"<ul><li>To bake a cake, you sift the flour to get out the lumps. When you sift, you separate out one thing from another.</li><li>When you sort through the mail looking for the bills or go through your photos to find that shot of your dog, that’s sifting, too. Detectives sift through piles of evidence when investigating crimes, and you might sift through the hundred applications you get from drummers eager to join your band, to find Ms. Right. When you're at the beach, you can sift sand through your fingers, and you might see big machines that sift the sand to clean it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2676,"<ul><li>Anything slight is very small. There's a slight chance you'll run into a celebrity in New York City — in other words, don't count on it. A slight is also an insult, like giving someone the cold shoulder. Burr.</li><li>Every meaning of slight stems from the Old Norse for ""small or flimsy."" If you have a slight build, you're slim with small bones. A slight deviation from your plan is a tiny adjustment. As a verb, to slight means to ignore or be indifferent toward someone; it's also the noun for the act of ignoring. If you direct a movie and the star doesn't thank you in her award acceptance speech, you'll be offended at the slight.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2677,"<ul><li>Fairy dust, stars, Christmas lights, Hanukkah candles, freshly fallen snow, a lake when the sun hits it just right — all of these things sparkle. That means they shine with a bright, glistening, shimmering light.</li><li>Sparkle can also refer to joy or merriment. When you're having a really good time, your face will sparkle. As a verb, sparkle means to be lively and excited, or to be so brilliant at something that you shine above the rest. It can also describe something bubbly or foamy — like when you add soap to your bath to make the bathwater sparkle. Sparkle can also describe something that produces sparks — like a magic wand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2678,"<ul><li>A sprinkle is a light shower of something, often water. It’s also a verb that means to gently scatter something. A sprinkle of snow won’t cause school to close, but a sprinkle of fairy dust could transport you to a magical land.</li><li>When there’s a sprinkle of rain, you should bring an umbrella just in case it turns into a downpour. A sprinkler causes a sprinkle of water to fall on the flowerbeds, and if it’s really hot, it can be fun to play under. At the Memorial Day parade, the firefighters might sprinkle confetti over the crowd — and if you’re lucky, they’ll sprinkle candy, too. Speaking of candy, a sprinkle is also a tiny treat often sprinkled on your ice cream.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2679,"<ul><li>If something is stale, it's no longer fresh. Ever bite into a piece of bread that's been left out a little too long? Chances are it's stale, or dry and hard to eat. Try making some croutons out of it.</li><li>The word stale comes from the Old French estaler meaning ""to halt,"" which is what happens to your jaw when you try and bite down on a piece of stale bread — it just can't chew through it. But stale isn't a word that's used only when talking about food. When an idea is stale, it's old or boring. And when a horse stales, it's not old and crusty, it's urinating. Step aside.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U14_2680,"<ul><li>The adjective utter is often used as an intensifier to mean ""total"" — often with negative connotations (like ""utter failure""). As a verb, the word has a totally unrelated meaning: to speak or to articulate a sound.</li><li>If you utter something, you give it voice. You could utter a cry or utter complete sentences; either way, you are expressing yourself. However, if you declare someone an utter moron, you are saying he is a complete and total moron; not that he is a moron expressing himself. Don't confuse the spelling of utter with udder — the latter is the part of the cow that you milk.</li></ul>"

Long before you applied the makeup, you had to apply for the job.</li><li>You can apply the word apply to many situations, including when you make use of something — like when you apply the brakes on a car. Apply also means to really put effort into  a task, like to apply yourself to learning Greek or reaching the next level on your favorite video game. But then again, maybe those examples don’t apply.</li></ul>"

If you're hoping to get a letter from your pen pal, you'll eagerly await the mail carrier's arrival every afternoon.</li><li>When you await a phone call, you might sit by the telephone at home or keep your cell phone in your hand. A prisoner who awaits trial is biding his time until his case comes before a judge. Sometimes await implies that some particular outcome is in store for someone: ""A terrible surprise awaits her, when she gets home and sees that her dog ate the sofa.""</li></ul>"

You can also talk about a beloved pet or possession.</li><li>You probably have some things you really love: a bike, a skateboard, a book, a DVD, maybe a souvenir from a trip. Those are beloved possessions — you really like them a lot. People also talk about beloved family members, beloved pets, and beloved friends. This is a word for things and people you're crazy about. And if you're feeling really crazy on Valentine's Day, go ahead and tell your crush that she's your beloved.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2685,"<ul><li>The climate is the general weather in a particular region. Florida is known for its temperate climate. The word climate is also used figuratively to mean ""the usual conditions,"" as in ""It's a favorable climate for school reform.""</li><li>Climate descends from Greek klima ""region, surface of the earth,"" and from klinein ""to slope."" The original use of the word climate in English was in reference to one of the sloping zones of the earth from the equator toward the poles. This meaning was often used to refer to weather conditions in a zone of the earth, which developed into the current meaning of ""the weather.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2686,"<ul><li>To complain is to express your unhappiness about something. You might complain to your landlord about a raise in your rent, or to the cops about your noisy neighbors. Just don't whine; it won't get you anywhere.</li><li>Speakers of Yiddish will know that complain is often interchangeable with kvetch, which is what you do when you don't like the food or the small portions. But you can complain in a more formal way by, say, writing a letter or even filing a lawsuit. But whether the issue is large or small, do yourself a favor and don't complain too often, or people might stop taking you seriously.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2687,"<ul><li>If you confuse two things, you are not correctly identifying them. If you confuse heartburn with a heart attack, you might end up at the emergency room instead of in the antacid aisle of the drugstore.</li><li>To confuse can also mean to bewilder. If you tell a teacher that she's confusing you, you probably mean that she's being more complex than you can handle. A lot of people get confused by the differences among ""their,"" ""they're,"" and ""there."" To confuse the situation even further, there's ""theirs"" and ""there's.""</li></ul>"

Loans, library books, and school assignments usually have a due date.</li><li>The first question students usually ask when given an assignment is ""When is it due?"" The word due has to do with deadlines and things that are owed. When you're time is up on a library book, it's due. Many bills — such as cable and phone bills — are due once a month. If you miss a due date, you could be in trouble: you might get a bad grade on your paper or the cable guy might take away your favorite stations.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2689,"<ul><li>To establish something means to begin it or bring it about. If you want everyone in your family to bring you chocolate every evening, you can establish a “Chocolates for Me” policy requiring it.</li><li>Establish is related to stable through its Latin roots and has many meanings, but all have the feel of building on a stable foundation. Besides the meaning of setting a policy, establish can also mean to prove one's value. You should establish yourself in a community before you try to bring change to it. Similarly, if you like to debate controversial issues, you'd best begin with facts that have been established and are not open to question. If you have a lot of money and want to build up your community, you can establish, or found, a school or library there.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2690,"<ul><li>A furnace is an appliance that heats houses and buildings by burning fuel or circulating hot water. Your furnace might rumble in the basement, sending heat up through your house's radiators.</li><li>Most houses in cold climates have a furnace, to warm their rooms during the chilly months of the year. Furnaces also have industrial uses, like burning trash or extracting ore from metal. If someone says, ""It's as hot as a furnace in this classroom!"" they mean that it's extremely hot. Furnace comes from the Old French fornaise, ""oven,"" with the Latin root word fornacem, ""oven or kiln.""</li></ul>"

The word leash is also useful for describing a figurative kind of guide or restraint: ""The teachers at that school keep their students on a short leash when they take field trips downtown."" The students aren't on actual leashes, but they are constrained. Leash comes from the Old French word laissier, or ""loose.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2692,"<ul><li>Someone who is mature acts grown up, like an adult. However, when one sister says to another, ""That's so mature,""  she's usually using the word sarcastically, because her sister has done something very immature, like sticking out her tongue.</li><li>The adjective mature doesn't only describe advancing age, although the residents of a senior citizens' home could definitely be considered mature. Anything that is fully developed, like an aged cheese or bottle of wine, can also be called mature. The word can also refer to something that is only appropriate for people who are considered legal adults, like the movie that is for ""mature audiences only.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2693,"<ul><li>To measure something is to figure out how much of it is there. A measure can also be a step toward a goal: take measures to ensure you don't flunk an exam by cracking the books.</li><li>You can take measures to improve your health: limit sweets, get enough rest, get some exercise, and wash your hands to avoid the spread of germs. The noun also means a standard for comparison. You can measure your time against the good you will do if you volunteer to help out a child via a mentoring program.</li></ul>"

After the school talent show, your principal said he didn't know there were so many gifted singers in our midst.</li><li>Midst sounds a lot like mist, the fog that rolls in and can fill a place. Midst carries this same sense of being surrounded or placed in the middle of. It can be physical, like being in the midst of great athletes at the hockey game, or in regard to time, like the team captain breaking his foot in the midst of playoffs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2695,"<ul><li>Misery is a state of deep unhappiness or discomfort. It's not dropping your ice cream cone. It's having a hairy monster steal your ice cream cone, eat it in one bite, and then kidnap you and carry you off to his cave.</li><li>Misery describes a miserable situation and a miserable feeling. Waiting four hours in the hot sun for a concert you don't want to see and can't afford? That's misery. The only way to survive is to bring a friend who hates the band as much as you––because misery loves company.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2696,"<ul><li>Powerless means lacking strength, ability, or authority. If nothing you do stops your dog from barking, you're powerless to make her be quiet.</li><li>A person who doesn't have the power they need to accomplish something can be described as powerless. A flustered substitute teacher is powerless to silence a chattering classroom, and citizens who don't vote are powerless to change their elected representatives in Congress. Power, ""strength or vigor,"" can be traced back to a root meaning ""power"" or ""lord."" When you add the suffix -less, or ""lacking,"" you get powerless.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2697,"<ul><li>Generally you should eat dinner prior to brushing your teeth. Use the adjective prior for things that exist earlier in time or that happen first in time or order.</li><li>This is a formal word that is often used in legal language. A prior claim is a person's right to something that is considered more important or valuable because it came first. If you're looking for a less formal synonym, choose the word previous. Prior is from a Latin word with the same spelling.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2698,"<ul><li>In their spare time, teenagers LOVE doing extra research, by investigating the facts of a certain subject and studying and recording what they learn. And if you believe that, you need to do more research on the habits of teenagers.</li><li>Research comes from the Old French word recercher, meaning ""seek out,"" or ""search closely."" When you do research, you are searching for knowledge and facts. Although you write plenty of research papers in college, on anything from the Industrial Revolution to the meaning behind a fur-lined teacup, the term is often used when talking about science, because scientists use step-by-step research to prove what is true, or not true, in their line of work.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U15_2699,
4000EEW_B05_U15_2700,"<ul><li>Variety is a quality similar to diversity or difference. Some feel having variety in life is much more exciting than doing the same routine day in and day out.</li><li>You’ve likely heard the expression “variety is the spice of life” to describe how our days are more interesting when different things happen. Variety can also describe different things that are classified under one category or type, like varieties of apple — granny smith, pink lady, or red delicious. A variety show is entertainment that includes a number of different and unrelated acts, like fire eaters, string bands, comedians, lounge singers, and spoon players.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2701,"<ul><li>If you're altogether certain, you know it for a fact. Since you're altogether sure that your calculations are correct, go ahead with the experiment. Please wear your goggles just in case.</li><li>Never use “all together” (meaning “all in one place”) when you mean altogether (which can also mean ""all things considered""). It was risky to bring us all together again after so many years, but you have to admit that altogether we had a good time. Altogether, it could have been worse. It wasn't altogether bad. I suppose we won't do it again next year.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2702,"<ul><li>If you're in a bind, you have been hindered by some situation. You'll find yourself in a bind if you agree to bring dessert to a party, only to realize that you're out of fruit, sugar, and chocolate chips.</li><li>The verb bind means to tie, secure, or fasten as with string or rope. When you put a Christmas tree on the top of your car, you need to bind it with twine to make sure it stays there while you drive. The past tense of bind is ""bound."" To bind is also to create an emotional attachment. Your love for your family binds you to them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2703,"<ul><li>If you're just learning to skateboard, you’ve probably got an ugly bruise or two to show for it — those purple and yellow patches you get on your skin where you’ve bumped and scraped. They probably hurt, too!</li><li>You can find bruises at the grocery store, too — those soft, mushy spots on a peach or an apple — and if you drop a tomato, you're likely to bruise it.   You can bruise your knee or bruise someone's feelings — if you tell your friend you don't like her novel, you’ll bruise her ego.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2704,"<ul><li>If something has been done a certain way for a long time and has become generally accepted, it's a custom.  Asking strangers for candy on one night a year would seem strange if it weren't an established custom.</li><li>If you have been imprisoned in a far off country when you were just trying to blend in, you might have misunderstood the local customs. Custom can be traced back to the Latin verb consuescere, meaning ""to accustom,"" in other words ""to get used to."" Custom can also describe something that you order made just the way you want it. Your five-seated bicycle is very original; was it custom-made?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2705,"<ul><li>Someone who's disobedient doesn't follow the rules. If your dog won't sit, stay, or heel, you can describe her as disobedient.</li><li>When you refuse to obey someone in authority, you're disobedient. A frustrated substitute teacher might describe the entire second grade class as disobedient, and you may try to train your cat to use the toilet but find her to be a disobedient pet. The word comes from combining obedient — with its root of oboedientem, Latin for ""obey,"" — with the prefix dis, or ""do the opposite of.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2706,"<ul><li>When you foresee something, you predict or realistically envision it happening. Did you foresee your team winning the playoffs, or were you surprised?</li><li>Think of foresee as “to see before.” Prophets in literature are able to foresee events that come to pass; in Greek mythology Tiresias is known for his ability to foresee the future. But foresee is not always linked to a supernatural sense. Regular people can foresee events by imagining them taking place — and sometimes we use this as a way of prevention. If you foresee yourself failing geometry if you don’t study more, you will probably hit the books.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2707,"<ul><li>If you had a brief or incomplete look at something, you had a glimpse. ""He didn't mean to peek, but he got a glimpse of his birthday present when his wife tried to sneak it into the house. Of course, it's pretty hard to hide a ladder.""</li><li>You can use glimpse as a noun (like when you ""catch a glimpse of someone"") or as a verb (like when you ""glimpse in someone's direction""). Although the word glimpse is usually used to describe the physical act of sneaking a peek at something, you can also use the noun glimpse to indicate a vague idea or suggestion. Perhaps, you can have a glimpse into your future by observing your parents' actions or by consulting a Tarot card reader.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2708,"<ul><li>A hoop is a ring or circle made of some stiff material. Gardeners use hoops to support plants, and many people wear hoops around their wrists as bracelets.</li><li>You can try to toss a basketball through a hoop, wear gold hoops as earrings, or sport an old fashioned hoop skirt, a flexible band that widens a petticoat and the skirt covering it. You can also rotate and spin a hula hoop around your body for fun. If your boss makes you ""jump through hoops"" at work, it means she requires you to complete difficult, possibly unnecessary, tasks.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2709,"<ul><li>On a gloomy day, you may feel compelled to list your misfortunes: a broken umbrella, a broken heart, a broken toe. Misfortune means bad luck or the state of having bad luck.</li><li>Break misfortune into its parts and you get mis- meaning bad and fortune meaning chance or luck. Sometimes it can feel like misfortune follows you. Picture it as a gloomy psychic named ""Miss Fortune"" who can only see the bad things in your future.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2710,"<ul><li>Negative means focused on what is bad or lacking. A negative ad tells you bad things about the competition. A negative person loves to complain.</li><li>In math, a negative number is less than zero. People who see the glass half empty have a negative outlook. Ask your mom for ice cream and receive an answer in the negative? Don't be too negative back to her, or it'll be a while before you have another chance at ice cream.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B05_U16_2712,"<ul><li>To plead with someone is to try to convince them to see it your way. Your kids may plead with you to let them go on the super-huge outrageous roller coaster built in 1968, but you know better.</li><li>The term plead comes from the word plea, which is from the legal system, where lawyers make a plea to the court and argue a case for their client. To plead is to ask for something from someone, often on the verge of begging. You may plead with the phone company to give an appointment time that spans only three hours, but, regardless of your pleading, they will make you wait eight hours for the technician to finally show.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2713,"<ul><li>When you rip something, you tear it quickly or forcefully. It's almost always better to rip off a Band-Aid than to peel it off slowly.</li><li>You can rip a piece of paper in half, or rip a hole in the roof of your tent. When you tear, split, or pull something apart, you rip it. You can also rip figuratively — like when your move to a new city rips you apart from your best friend. A rip off is a bad deal or a swindle, a phrase that's been popular since about 1970, although rip meaning ""steal"" was used as prison slang much earlier.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2714,"<ul><li>Sake means the purpose for doing something. You might run a fund-raising marathon for the sake of sick children.</li><li>Sake comes from the old English term for ""affair,"" or ""cause of guilt."" We usually use sake to talk about the motivating cause of something we do. You might study hard for the sake of your grades. But then again, you might blow off your studies for the sake of having fun. Spelled the same way, but pronounced SAH-key, sake is also the name of a Japanese alcoholic drink made from fermented rice.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2715,"<ul><li>To scrape something is to scratch or remove its surface. If you scrape your knee, you'll probably need a Band Aid.</li><li>You can scrape the toe of your favorite boots, or scrape your arm on a branch. This might cause a scrape on your skin or your shoe, a mark that shows. There is also a kind of scrape you can hear, like the scrape of a chair on a floor, and the kind of scrape, or awkward situation, you suddenly find yourself in. People also scrape things together, or gather up as much as they can find.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2716,"<ul><li>The noun source describes an origin, like the source who gave the journalist the information that broke a new story, or the place something originates, like the source of a river, or the Web site that is your source for celebrity gossip.</li><li>The noun source can also refer to information obtained from documents, such as books, letters, newspapers, and journals. For example, when you write a research paper, you read, paraphrase and quote from sources. A source can also be a place where you get things, like a certain store being your source for discount sneakers or something that provides, like oranges, a good source of Vitamin C.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2717,"<ul><li>You know when you've done something really wrong, and the person who gets you in trouble has that unforgiving look on his face? The best word for that look is stern, meaning ""strict"" or ""severe.""</li><li>Stern, strict, severe, harsh, unforgiving — they all more or less mean the same thing, which is very tough and exacting, with a little helping of seriousness thrown in for good measure. What does this have to do with the stern of a boat, also known as the rear area? Um, nothing? But it's good to know about that meaning too, since it could come in handy some day when you're giving directions on a ship.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2718,"<ul><li>When a needle pulls thread through fabric and into a loop, that's a stitch. Every quilt, no matter how elaborate, starts with a single stitch.</li><li>You can stitch a design on a pillow, or stitch up a hole in your jeans using stitches. Doctors sometimes stitch up patients' skin, too — if you cut yourself badly enough, you might need stitches. Another kind of stitch is a painful cramp in your stomach or side: ""I stopped running when I got a stitch."" If someone says, ""I haven't got a stitch to wear,"" they're short on clothing. And being ""in stitches"" means laughing uncontrollably.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2719,"<ul><li>A thump is a hard, thudding sound, or an equally hard hit or blow, like the thump your older brother gives you when you embarrass him in front of his friends.</li><li>If you drop your backpack full of books it'll make a thump as it hits the floor. And, if your friend starts to choke on his lemonade at lunch, you might want to give him a thump on the back. You can also thump enthusiastically on a drum. Thump is an imitative word, one that mimics the sound of hitting something heavily. It dates from the sixteenth century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U16_2720,"<ul><li>You can use the adjective vehement  to describe an extremely strong, powerful, or intense emotion or force. The teenager argued for a much later curfew in a vehement speech to her parents; her parents responded with an equally vehement “No way!”</li><li>Vehement is from Latin and was originally applied to intense natural phenomena: pain, heat, wind, etc. It is now more commonly used for intense emotions or beliefs. With the adverb form, people can be vehemently in favor of something, but the more common usage is for people to be vehemently opposed to something. Many people, for example, are vehemently opposed to politicians they didn't vote for, other people spoiling the endings of movies or books, or someone else taking the last piece of chocolate. The stress is on the first syllable (VEE-uh-ment).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2721,"<ul><li>Someone who's ailing is sick. You might visit your ailing grandmother in the hospital.</li><li>You can use the adjective ailing to describe someone who's very ill, or use it figuratively, to talk about ""our ailing economy,"" or ""the ailing school system."" The next time you call in sick to work, you might say, ""I can't come in today — I'm afraid I'm ailing."" Ailing comes from the verb ail, ""trouble or afflict,"" from the Old English eglan, ""to trouble, plague, or pain.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2722,"<ul><li>If two things are alike, they resemble or are similar to each other. You and your sister might be alike in many ways, including your love for strawberry ice cream.</li><li>If all the houses in your neighborhood look alike, it's hard to tell one from another, and if their parents always dress twin brothers alike, it's going to be impossible for people to remember who's who. Things that are alike are the same. The original form of the word was aliche, from the Old English gelic, ""similar,"" with a Germanic root, which it shares with the word like.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2723,"<ul><li>That tattoo on your lower back is likely to appall your mother. Just like her pink hair once appalled your grandmother. To appall is to shock and disgust.</li><li>Appall comes from an Old French word meaning ""to make pale."" If a gory scene in a movie appalls you, you're likely to turn pale. The word appall always carries with it the feeling of disgust. You might be shocked by a loud noise, but in order for it to appall you, it would probably have to come along with a really foul smell or a gruesome scene.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2724,"<ul><li>When you bathe, you wash yourself. A cat bathes itself by licking its fur with a rough tongue. If you're human, don't try that technique.</li><li>The word bathe generally means to clean yourself in a tub of water — as opposed to shower, which means to wash beneath a stream of water. You can, however, use this verb to describe almost any kind of cleansing: you might bathe the scrape on a child's knee with a soapy cloth. Poetically, the sun can also bathe, or saturate, something with light. In Britain, to bathe also means ""to swim.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2725,
4000EEW_B05_U17_2726,"<ul><li>As a verb, critique means to review or examine something critically. As a noun, a critique is that review or examination, like an art essay or a book report.</li><li>The French version of this word is spelled the same (meaning ""the art of criticism"") and came from the Greek kritike tekhne (""the critical art""). This shouldn't come as a great surprise, since it was the Greeks who gave us such masters of the critique as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Today, through book reports, argument papers, and critical essays, we carry on the tradition of the critique, which is one of the most important skills we'll ever learn in school.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2727,"<ul><li>Do you know the population growth rate of your city? The education levels of everyone on your block? Then you're a fan of demography, the branch of sociology that studies human behavior by analyzing statistical information.</li><li>The word demography comes from two ancient Greek words, demos, meaning ""the people,"" and graphy, meaning ""writing about or recording something"" — so literally demography means ""writing about the people."" Like many branches of the sciences, demography began in the 19th century, when the general craze for cataloging information about the world really took off (think Darwin.) A common related word is demographics, referring to the raw statistical data that's used for analysis.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2728,"<ul><li>When a doctor tells you why you're feeling ill, he gives you a diagnosis. He asks questions, checks your symptoms, and then identifies what's making you sick.</li><li>Diagnosis is a medical term, but you can diagnose lots of things: problems in a relationship, a coming economic crisis, or the reason the car won't start. If you have a sore throat, runny nose and a bad cough, most of the time doctors will diagnose a cold. If the car won't start and the lights and radio are also off, the diagnosis is simple: your battery’s dead. Anytime you determine the cause of a problem, you give a diagnosis.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2729,"<ul><li>When you dip something, you plunge it quickly into a liquid or soft substance. You might dip your toe into a swimming pool to check the water temperature.</li><li>When you finger paint, you dip a fingertip into a puddle of paint, and when you eat a snack you might dip tortilla chips into salsa. You can also say that a boat bobbing on the ocean dips, or that a bird dropping lower in the sky dips down. A dip can be a quick swim, a delicious sauce meant for dunking other foods in, or a downward slope. The Old English root, dyppan, means ""immerse"" or ""baptize.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2730,"<ul><li>If you are in distress, you are in trouble. You're hurting — either physically or mentally.</li><li>See the word stress hanging out at the end of distress? There's a good reason for that. The noun distress refers to a state of severe anxiety or strain, often brought about by failing to study for an exam, harassing grizzly bears, or borrowing your sister's clothes without asking. When used as a verb, to distress means to cause all that pain, suffering and anxiety — in other words, to stress somebody out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2731,"<ul><li>A fever happens when the body's internal temperature is higher than normal. If you have a sore throat, a headache, and a fever, you may have the flu.</li><li>When you have a fever, your skin may feel hot, and your temperature as measured by a thermometer will be high. A fever can also make you feel achy, tired, and chilly, and it can be a sign that you've got some kind of infection. The Old English is fefor, from a Latin root, febris,  also ""fever."" Doctors and nurses sometimes refer to a fever as a ""febrile response.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2732,"<ul><li>Things that are gloomy, stark, ghastly, and somber are grim. Sunshine, puppies, and rainbows are not grim; zombies, reapers, and mummies are grim. Less scary things like drizzly, foggy days can also be called grim.</li><li>Two famous uses of the adjective grim are the Grim Reaper and Grimm's Fairy Tales. Mr. Reaper shows up in movies and books wearing a long, hooded black cape and carrying a scythe, or long-handled blade used, in less grim circumstances, for mowing grass and reaping grain: he represents death. The real-life German brothers wrote some bone-chilling tales under their own name, Grimm, meaning ""cruel, fierce,"" which is related to the English word grim.  Modern grim things include crime-drama images of dead bodies and characters in horror movies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2733,"<ul><li>Your gut is part of your digestive system — it's where food goes after you eat it, to get broken down into nutrients and waste. The expression to ""go with your gut"" means to follow your instincts, how you feel in your belly.</li><li>Your gut is quite literally your intestines, although the word is frequently used for any part of your digestive system, especially your stomach. Eating too much ice cream can give you an ache in your gut. When gut is a verb, it means to clean the internal organs out of a fish or other animal you intend to eat, or to completely empty a building. Colloquially, if you have guts, you're very brave.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B05_U17_2735,"<ul><li>What do food, medicine, and perfume have in common? Well, they all can be created from herbs. An herb is a plant that has a soft rather than a woody stem, and it tends to have a unique taste or smell.</li><li>There are many kinds of plants, but one that you've likely seen mentioned on a menu or ad for a medical treatment is the herb. Herbs are distinguished from other plants by their stem, which does not become permanent and woody; instead, it stays soft. Many herbs are used in cooking, such as basil and thyme, because they add flavor to foods. Many herbs, like ginseng and chamomile, are used in tea and are believed to be good for your health.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2736,"<ul><li>A militant is someone who is engaged in a war or who acts aggressively for their cause. If you are militant in your beliefs, you do not question them any more than a soldier questions his orders.</li><li>In the context of undeclared or guerrilla warfare, enemy fighters are often referred to not as soldiers but as militants, because they are not members of a formal army. As an adjective, militant often has a negative feel — people on one side of a debate will often try to cast those on the other side as militants.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2737,"<ul><li>A miracle is an event so marvelous that it seems like it was sent from above. Catching that foul ball from the stands at the World Series? A miracle!</li><li>Miracle, a noun meaning “amazing or wonderful occurrence,"" comes from the Latin miraculum “object of wonder.""  Dig way back and the word derives from smeiros, meaning ""to smile,"" which is exactly what you do when a miracle happens. To quote the American-French author Anais Nin, “The dream was always running ahead of me. To catch up, to live for a moment in unison with it, that was the miracle.” Just ask any rock star.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2738,"<ul><li>To mourn is to grieve for someone who has died, especially a loved one. One of the hardest experiences of childhood is when you mourn the loss of a beloved pet.</li><li>You can also mourn for things that you've lost, not only pets and people who have died. If your local library branch is forced to close, you might mourn its loss, missing being able to walk there from your house. The Old English root word of mourn is murnan, which means not only to mourn, but also to be anxious. Related words include ""mourner"" and ""mournful.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U17_2739,"<ul><li>Nonsense is stuff that sounds like language but doesn't have any meaning, like the phrase higgledy-piggledy-po, or fwumphy-doo. The most famous nonsense poem is Lewis Carroll's ""Jabberwocky.""</li><li>Nonsense means exactly what it sounds like: not containing a lick of sense. Nonsense words are made up. But sometimes if you say something in a really confusing way, people will say you're speaking nonsense: even though you're using normal words, you don't make any sense. Sometimes people will dismiss ideas that they don't like by calling them nonsense, but you might know better. Little household knick-knacks that have no purpose are also called nonsense.</li></ul>"

If you wake up and your eyes are red, your skin is yellow, and your tongue is swollen, find a physician, soon!</li><li>When we use the word physician, we typically mean a doctor that practices general healing, as opposed to a surgeon. Physician is a very old word, coming from both Greek and Latin roots for physic, meaning ""natural science and medicine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U18_2741,"<ul><li>An accent is a stress or emphasis on a particular part of something, usually a word. Pronounce the word ""doofus"" with the accent on the first syllable: DOO-fuss.</li><li>Accent comes from the Latin accentus, which means ""the intonation of singing."" We use accent for different kinds of emphasis in speech. In some foreign languages, the mark above a letter is an accent that signals how to pronounce it. If you accent something, like the ""t"" on the end of your name, you highlight it. In music, an emphasized note is accented. A regional accent is the particular way that people from that place speak.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U18_2742,"<ul><li>A barber is a person whose job is cutting hair in a barbershop. Your barber might have a tendency to cut your hair a little shorter than you like.</li><li>When you visit a barbershop, you sit in a special chair while the barber cuts your hair with scissors or electric clippers. Men are the most common customers of a barber, although women can also get their hair cut by barbers. Barber comes from the Anglo-French word barbour, which is rooted in the Latin word for ""beard,"" barb. Early barbers were certified not only to cut hair, but to perform surgery and dentistry as well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U18_2743,"<ul><li>A basement is a room that's below ground level, underneath the first floor. You might have a laundry room with a washer and dryer in your basement.</li><li>Some basements are partially under the level of the street, while others are completely below ground. Many, though not all, houses and larger buildings have basements. Some basements are ""finished,"" with carpeting and solid ceilings and walls, but more often they're very basic rooms used for storage. The word dates from 1730, most likely from the Italian basamento, ""column base.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U18_2744,"<ul><li>Something that's blank is empty or undecorated. A blank canvas hasn't been drawn or painted on yet — it's clean and unmarked.</li><li>A blank computer screen has no information on it, and a blank look on someone's face is completely free of any expression, revealing nothing. If your mind goes blank during a job interview, you are left without any thoughts for a moment. When blank is a noun, it means ""a line to be filled in"" or ""an empty space."" In the 1500s, a blank was the empty, white center of a target, from the French word blanc, or ""white.""</li></ul>"

The bright sunlight first thing in the morning might make you blink rapidly, until your eyes adjust.</li><li>Your eyes blink reflexively, when you're not even thinking about it, but you can also deliberately blink back tears. Certain lights blink as well, like your car's turn signal, flashing on and off. A figurative way to blink is to hesitate or give up, especially at a confrontation: ""The lawyers kept holding out for a settlement, waiting for the other side to blink first."" The origin of blink is probably the Middle Dutch blinken, ""to glitter.""</li></ul>"

If you love to sing but don't fancy a solo turn on a TV talent show, perhaps joining a choir would satisfy you.</li><li>Choir, pronounced QUIRE, comes from the Latin word chorus, which itself comes from the Greek name for a group of singers and dancers. We still use chorus for singing or dancing, but choir is exclusively for singing groups. Although choirs are traditionally associated with church services, they don't have to be. If you love singing but aren't religious, you could start a choir that sings about the glory of donuts. It's also a verb, as in, ""I love to choir.""</li></ul>"

So if you've already accepted two party invitations for Saturday night, don't complicate the situation by accepting a third.</li><li>This verb dates back to the 17th century, when it meant “to intertwine” or “to fold together."" This intertwining and folding together, however, sometimes don't work out so well. An infection can complicate an injury. A detour for road construction will complicate your usual route. And directions that are written in another language — and without pictures — complicate the assembly of furniture and toys.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U18_2749,"<ul><li>When something declines, it goes downhill. If you stop working out, your health may decline. If you want it to improve, you should start climbing inclines instead of coasting down declines.</li><li>The verb decline means refuse to accept, but the noun decline means a downward slope (the opposite of an incline), or a decrease in quality. At the gym, the treadmill has an incline button to control how steep your climb is. Sadly, there's no button for decline, which would be much easier. Both words contain cline, or ""to bend."" The prefix tells you which way the bend goes. Decline implies a going, or turning, down.</li></ul>"

When you’re running errands, you’re making a bunch of these all at once.</li><li>The noun errand can refer to the mission of the trip itself.

If you are taking food or clothing to someone in need, then you are on an errand of mercy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U18_2751,"<ul><li>A glove is a piece of clothing that you wear on your hand, to protect it or keep it warm. Most people wear a pair of gloves, unless — of course — they are imitating Michael Jackson.</li><li>Cold-weather gloves are soft and warm, made from fabrics like wool, polar fleece, or leather. There are also gloves that protect the skin on your hands while you're cleaning, using chemicals, or washing dishes; and gloves that prevent the spreading of germs, worn by food handlers and health care workers. Athletes sometimes wear gloves as well, like boxing gloves or the gloves worn by hockey goalies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U18_2752,"<ul><li>You hear about hermits more often than you meet one, and that’s because a hermit is someone who likes to be alone, far from people, sometimes because of their religious beliefs or maybe because they simply want some privacy.</li><li>Hermits like living solo, alone in the woods, up in a mountain, or sometimes they live in a city without hardly ever leaving their apartment.  The root of the word is the Greek erēmos, meaning “solitary.”  A life of solitude isn’t for everyone, but a hermit chooses it for any number of reasons.  For example, being able to honor their religious beliefs more fully or hating all of humanity are two possible motivations to become a hermit.</li></ul>"

It will help you remember the definition if you can remember the word's Latin roots. It comes from ponderare, which literally meant to weigh, and pondus, which means weight. People sometimes use the word ironically, for example, when someone asks you to do something you really don't want to do. You may tap your chin for a second and say, ""Let me ponder that."" Pause.

If you and your coworkers talk behind each other's backs, you will create a nasty atmosphere at work.</li><li>Atmosphere was coined by 17th-century scientists combining the Greek words for vapor, atmos, and sphere, sphaira. The earth's atmosphere is the air and gas surrounding our planet. Atmosphere also describes the feeling of a place. A coffee shop might have a cool, artsy atmosphere.

Bow down to the author! Well, no need for that, just make sure the author gets credit. Author usually refers to a professional writer.

Cargo can be loaded on a cart, but it's usually loaded on something much bigger. On a ship, cargo is stacked up in huge, colorful metal containers.

Book chapters are one example, and so is a chapter in a person's life or a chapter of an organization or club.

To state is to say something.</li><li>State comes from the Latin status, meaning ""condition of a country."" Interestingly, even before the Revolutionary War, Britain called the American colonies states. The “States” still refers to America, but state can refer to any country’s civil government.

Another kind of cabin is a small compartment or room, particularly one on a ship or an airplane.

If you have something scheduled every day of the week, your calendar is full. In that case you might keep track of your dates with a calendar on your computer (or phone).

When you’re out of the chemistry lab, you’ll most often hear calorie in relation to the energy in food or the energy you burn through exercise.

If you don’t get your paper in by the deadline, you won’t get a good grade.</li><li>If you think missing a deadline and getting a low grade is bad, think about how this word came to be: It was a line that went around a prison and if a prisoner crossed it, he could be shot. Now that’s a deadline! A deadline sounds scary, and it does frighten a lot of people — if you don't get a paper in by the deadline, you could lose points or fail. But hey, you’ll live.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U20_2791,"<ul><li>Exert basically means to put forth effort to do something. For example, when you exert yourself in a workout, you can really feel the burn in your muscles.</li><li>The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which is the source of our word — means to ""put forth."" That's where exert gets its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard at something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But exert can refer to other ways you ""push"": you exert your influence to convince others to think your way; when one nation exerts its power on another; and gravity exerts its force on us, holding us down on earth.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U20_2792,"<ul><li>A flank is the side of something, whether of beef or a military formation.</li><li>Although flank is specifically used to talk about a cut of meat, or the right or left side of a military formation, we also use it in those same senses for other objects or even metaphorically.

Being fond can mean anything from liking something a little (""I'm fond of that band"") to be extremely, almost absurdly interested in something (""He's a little too fond of football""). This word sometimes implies foolishness and absurdity: almost like you love something so much that you've lost your mind. But usually being fond is a good thing: it just means you enjoy something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U20_2794,"<ul><li>When you forbid something, you refuse to allow it. You might have heard your parents say things like, ""I forbid you to play ball in the house!"" or ""I forbid you to have any more parties when we're not home!""</li><li>Forbid comes from the Old English word forbeodan, meaning ""forbid, prohibit."" Forbid can also mean ""prevent"" or ""keep from happening."" The spare tire on your car will forbid you from driving any faster than 40 miles an hour — any faster and the car will shake. You may have heard forbid used in the expression ""God forbid . . ."" This refers to something you hope will not happen, so much so that you're asking God for a little help.</li></ul>"

You don't haul a sack of feathers, for example. You haul a bag of boulders, or a box of books. Haul is usually a verb, but you can also use it as a noun, when you're talking about lot of something that you caught or won. We went digging for clams—look at our haul!

4000EEW_B05_U20_2800,"<ul><li>An optimist is someone who always sees the bright side of any situation — a trait that can be either encouraging or annoying, depending on your frame of mind.</li><li>Winston Churchill once said, “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” When you think about the problems in the world, it might sometimes be difficult to remain an optimist. Yet some people just naturally look for the silver lining, like Eeyore in the Winnie the Pooh stories who, when admitting that it's still snowing and freezing, remarks, ""However, we haven't had an earthquake lately."" Now that's an optimist!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2801,"<ul><li>Background is what’s behind something — whether it’s physical, like a play’s scenery, or intangible, like a person's life story or the past facts of a current situation.  If you are shy, you might try to stay in the background at parties and avoid attention.</li><li>The original idea of background was the use of stage scenery or painted drops that established a play's setting. Later, the idea expanded to include the figurative meaning of something that was present yet not immediately noticed, such as the background music in a movie. It also came to mean material that happened earlier and contributed to something.  If your new boss does a ""background check"" on you, it's because she wants to know all the trouble you've caused in the past.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2802,"<ul><li>People who go fishing aren’t the only ones to use bait. When you hold a yard sale, place your best stuff closest to the sidewalk — to serve as bait. Bait can be anything from the worms that hide a hook to a stereo that tempts shoppers to stop and browse.</li><li>Bait can also mean the act of getting someone or something to do what you want. For generations, students have baited their teachers into wasting class time with a question about a personal interest or obsession: “This talk about integers is very fascinating, Mr. Green, but what do you think about last night’s Penguins game?” Bait comes from the Old Norse, word beita — “to cause to bite.” Asking Mr. Green what other Viking words he knows might be interesting, and provide bait for his next off-topic musing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2803,"<ul><li>To chronicle an event is to record it as it happens, and a chronicle is a record of those events.  If your grandmother took the time to chronicle the details of her 1910 journey to Japan, you can read her chronicle today.</li><li>To chronicle something is to describe past or current events.  Chronicle is related to chronological and comes from the Greek ta khronika, which means “annals of time.”  Events are usually chronicled in the order in which they occurred. The noun chronicle is a record of things that happened — told in chronological order, like the diary you kept in elementary school. It is a chronicle of those years.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2804,"<ul><li>Copper is a reddish-gold colored metal that's commonly used in electrical wires and plumbing. Your grandmother might make her famous chocolate caramel sauce in a shiny copper pot.</li><li>Before 1983, pennies were 95 percent copper. Today, they're almost entirely zinc (a less expensive metal), coated with a thin copper plating. They look the same, but the older coins are quite a bit heavier. Copper is a good conductor of heat and electricity, which is why it's used for both fancy cookware and wires. You can also use copper for things that have a similar color: ""His copper curls make him stand out from the other choir members.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2805,<ul><li>A disease is a health condition that has a specific set of symptoms and traits — such as malaria or heart disease.</li><li>Disease is not always about the human body being sick. Plants and animals are often the victims of disease. People also use the word disease in a more figurative sense to illustrate just how bad or damaging a negative influence can be — like the disease of greed among capitalists or the disease of plagiarism among college students.</li></ul>
4000EEW_B05_U21_2806,"<ul><li>Stories, customs, and beliefs that are passed from one generation to the next are called folklore. According to folklore, you shouldn't take rocks from the volcanoes in Hawaii because Pele, the volcano goddess, will be angry and curse you.</li><li>Folklore is a combination of the words folk and lore which dates from 1846. The former refers to a community of people, and the latter comes from the Old English lar, meaning learning or knowledge. Folk, in this sense, is also used in terms like folk music, folk dance, and folktale. Although traditionally folklore is passed along by word of mouth, in the modern era much folklore is being collected on the Internet.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2807,"<ul><li>To infect is to spread an illness to another person. If you sneeze on your friend, you may inadvertently infect her with your germs.</li><li>When a disease moves from person to person, it infects them. Most diseases only spread within one species, although there are some, like avian flu, that can infect both humans and other animals. Another way to infect someone is to deeply affect them with an idea or emotion: ""His enthusiasm for music infects the class with excitement."" The Latin root, inficere, means ""to spoil or stain"" and ""to dip into.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2808,"<ul><li>An itch is an unpleasant tingly sensation that makes you want to scratch. If you're allergic to poison ivy and you go hiking through a field of it, you'll have a terrible itch all over your legs.</li><li>Sometimes people confuse itch and scratch. An itch is the sensation that causes you to scratch, and when itch is a verb, it either means ""to feel or sense an itch,"" or ""to have a strong, restless urge,"" as when you itch to try out your uncle's motorcycle. Somehow, the word itch arose from its Old English root gicce, or gycce, ""an itch.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2809,"<ul><li>Literature is writing, usually good, creative, or smart writing, or at least we hope it is. If you love books and have stacks of them at home, then you are a lover of literature.</li><li>Literature comes from the Latin root litterātūra, or lettered, but there are higher standards for literature than just something written down. Novels and stories are considered literature. If you're a practicing psychologist, you have keep up with the current literature on psychology, which is what researching psychologists write, not novels about shrinks. You might want your profession to be literature, but you'll probably have to teach literature while you're waiting for the book deal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2810,"<ul><li>A decade means ten years, a century means a hundred, and millennium means a thousand. Think: a decade of marriage, the new millennium.</li><li>In Latin, in the Romance languages, and in the metric system, mille refers to a thousand. A millimeter is a thousandth of a meter, a milliliter a thousandth of a liter, a millennium is a thousand years. Think of the number ""one million"" as a thousand thousands, and you'll get the idea.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2811,"<ul><li>A myth is a story that’s told again and again and serves to explain why something is the way it is. A creation myth, for example, is a story that tells how the world came into being.</li><li>You may have studied Greek or Roman myths in which gods and goddesses wage war and play tricks on each other. These myths are not necessarily true stories from the past — the main idea is that they explain certain ideas about the world and how people act. The story might be accepted as true and serve to explain some fact about the world, or it might be known to be made-up but nevertheless illustrates something about people or history.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2812,"<ul><li>If you work for a marketing firm, your job is to promote new products — to publicize them and to try to get the public to buy them.</li><li>The verb promote can also mean to advance to a higher position. Because of your hard work, your boss might decide to promote you. In school, passing students are promoted each year when they enter a higher grade. In chess, the verb promote is used when a pawn is exchanged for a higher ranking piece. Make sure you promote your pawn to a queen, giving you two queens on the board and a strong advantage in the game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2813,"<ul><li>The verb relate means ""to make a connection."" If you can relate to someone's story, something like that has happened to you.</li><li>Relate also means ""to give an account of something verbally,"" like relating details of your trip to Sweden. That meaning of relate comes from the Latin word relatus, meaning ""to recount, tell.""  If you talk about the federal budget crisis, people might not be interested until you relate it, meaning ""explain the relationship between,"" to the possible job cuts at your local schools and police departments.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2814,"<ul><li>Religion has two related meanings: it’s the belief that one or more divine beings are responsible for the fate of all human life, and it’s also an organization where people of a specific religion can express their beliefs.</li><li>Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam: these are examples of religions, and millions around the world follow the principles defined by their chosen faith.  The Latin root religio means “to bind,” and religion binds people together not just by their practices, but also by their ideas.  Most religions have their own story about the creation of the universe, and each has a different explanation for the meaning of life, which is a source of comfort for a religion’s followers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2815,"<ul><li>When you determine the sum, you add up all the numbers. When you sum something up, you focus on all of its important points.</li><li>The word sum can also refer to a certain amount of money. A new car might cost you a huge sum of money. But if you sum or add up all its benefits, you might be able to justify spending so much. You calculate the total on a restaurant bill when you sum up the prices of everything you ordered. Sum doesn't have to refer strictly to numbers. When you sum something up, you're giving an overview or general statement about it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2816,"<ul><li>A teller is either someone who tells some sort of story or a person who works in a bank. A bank clerk who loves to talk about her adventures? She's both kinds of teller.</li><li>You might be a teller of tales, known for spinning stories, or a teller of lies, famous for your fibs. If you're a teller at a bank, you cash customers' checks and make their deposits. There aren't as many bank tellers as there once were, since this job is increasingly done by ATMs, or automatic teller machines. Teller comes from an obscure sense of the verb tell, ""count.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2817,"<ul><li>Trustworthy describes something you can believe in — it's completely reliable. Your favorite newspaper can be trustworthy — they always print the truth — and people can be trustworthy too. You only tell your secrets to a trustworthy friend.</li><li>Breaking apart the word trustworthy gives you a clue to its meaning. It combines the common word trust, which describes something you can rely on, and the word worthy, which describes something that deserves respect. So something — or someone — that's trustworthy deserves your trust. In an election, you'll likely vote for the most trustworthy candidate because you believe she'll keep her promises. If you're trustworthy, that means you're reliable: you do what you say you're going to do.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2818,"<ul><li>When you renovate or improve something, changing it to make it more modern, you can say you update it. The process of doing this can also be called an update.</li><li>If you decide to download the latest version of an app or program, you update it, and when you add recent information to your resume before starting a job search, you also update that. You might also update your friends about your job hunt, letting them know you're seeking employment — you're giving them the latest information, or an update. The verb dates from the 1940s.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2819,"<ul><li>A vein is a blood vessel. If you've ever donated blood, you know that having a needle put in your vein by a health care worker is not nearly as scary as it sounds.</li><li>Although it mainly describes part of the body's circulatory system, vein can also refer to a pattern that looks like a vein in your body. For example, you can describe the streaks of color that run through blue cheese as veins of greenish-blue. Similarly, a theme or idea that continues appearing throughout a book could be called a vein. The trickiest thing about the word vein is trying not to confuse it with its homophones — vane (as in weather vane) and vain (as in conceited).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U21_2820,"<ul><li>We’re pretty sure you wouldn’t drink a mysterious substance labeled “poisonous snake venom,” even if you didn’t know the meaning of venom. However, just to be clear, venom means ""poison."" Stay away from it.</li><li>Venom is poisonous fluid produced by animals such as snakes, spiders, and certain people. Okay — we take that last one back, sort of. Scientifically speaking, people don’t produce venom, but they can certainly do so in a metaphorical sense. That’s why venom can also be used to mean “malice” or “hatred.” If you encounter someone who seems full of venom, remember that kindness can be a good antidote. (So can a really insulting remark.)</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2821,"<ul><li>Charity is the donation of something, like money, to a cause or person in need. Before offering charity to someone, make sure he is, in fact, needy, and not just some fashion fiend dressed like a homeless person!</li><li>Charity comes in many forms including monetary donation, volunteering, or providing clothes and food for those less fortunate. The Greek poet Homer said, “The charity that is a trifle to us can be precious to others.” Think of charity, then, as something that may cost you a little, but can benefit someone else greatly. Charity also refers to a nice way to treat people, an organization that helps people, or a plant with blue and white flowers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2822,"<ul><li>Commerce is the exchange of goods and services. It's business. Competition between cities wanting to host the Olympics is fierce because the games increase tourism and commerce.</li><li>Commerce made its way into English from the Latin word commercium — com-, meaning ""together,"" and -mercium, meaning ""merchandise."" Business, trade, and retailing are all common synonyms. Commerce doesn't always refer to buying and selling, though, just as the marketplace doesn't always refer to goods and services. Data, information, and opinions, too, can be exchanged and traded, as on the Internet, which is a great place for the commerce of ideas.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2823,"<ul><li>You can condemn, or openly criticize, someone who is behaving inappropriately. If you are an animal rights activist, you would probably condemn someone for wearing fur.</li><li>Condemn originally comes, through Old French, from the Latin word condemnāre, ""to sentence, condemn."" You may see politicians condemn each other in political ads during a campaign in hopes of improving their chances of winning an election. You also might hear of a convict being ""condemned to death."" In this sense of the word, to condemn still carries on its Latin meaning of ""to sentence.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2824,"<ul><li>The adjective cozy describes being comfortable and warm, like when you feel cozy curled up on the couch under a soft blanket, in front of a roaring fire.</li><li>""Isn't this cozy?"" If you hear these words, you might be in a friendly, casual place where everyone feels welcome. Or, perhaps you are in a small cabin that is warm and dry as they rain pours down outside. Or you have just stumbled upon the judge of a writing contest having dinner with one of the aspiring novelists — cozy can also mean ""scheming."" And as a noun? A cozy is a padded cloth used to keep a teapot warm.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2825,"<ul><li>To deplete is to use up or consume a limited resource. Visiting relatives might deplete your refrigerator of food, or a pestering friend might deplete your patience.</li><li>The verb deplete is used like “to drain.” A long, exhausting day can deplete your body of energy and a summer drought can deplete a region’s water supply. If you deplete your body of hydration after a lot of exercise, be sure to replete yourself with a nice glass of water.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2826,"<ul><li>The general sense of economy is careful management of resources such as money and materials, so as not to waste them, but the more familiar reference is to a system of producing, distributing, and consuming goods and services.</li><li>The word economy derives from Greek oikonomos, ""manager of a household,"" from oikos, ""house."" The earliest meaning of the adjective economical and the noun economics was also in connection with the management of a household. The earliest mention of a nation's economy was in Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, an important work in the history of political economy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2827,"<ul><li>An empire is a group of countries or territories that are under the control of a single entity but it can be used figuratively too. She rules her cosmetics empire well, with a solid knowledge of lipsticks, eye shadows, and more.</li><li>Have you ever heard the phrase, “The sun never sets on the British Empire?” This came about because during the 1800s countries in every time zone around the globe were ruled by England, and it was always daytime in one of them. Although other empires have existed back through time to the original Roman Empire, perhaps the most well-known empire today comes from the popular Star Wars films in which the rebels fight Darth Vader and his evil Empire.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2828,
4000EEW_B05_U22_2829,"<ul><li>Heed is an old word, meaning ""to listen to and follow."" It can also be used as a noun: ""Take heed of my instructions,"" said the wizard, ""for the magic potion will work only by the light of the full moon.""</li><li>The most common use of heed is with warnings, as in ""You'd better heed my advice, or you'll be in serious trouble!"" The word derives from Old English hēdan and is related to the Dutch hoeden and German hüten — from Germanic cultures where fairy tales with mysterious warnings and magical consequences abound.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2830,"<ul><li>To hitchhike is to get a free ride from a passing car. If you see someone standing alongside the highway raising a thumb, chances are that person is hitchhiking, not just expressing approval of your driving style.</li><li>In the past, it wasn't unheard of for people to hitchhike across the country, but it's much less common today. If you hitchhike, you typically stand beside a road or highway with one thumb pointed up. The hope for a hitchhiker is that a car will stop and its driver will provide a free ride. While for many people, hitchhiking was once considered a reasonable way to travel, today it's illegal in some places and generally thought of as dangerous. The word hitchhike dates from the 1920s.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2831,"<ul><li>Imitation may be the most sincere form of flattery, but to mock is to make fun of or mimic someone with contempt, ridicule or derision. ""Louise’s favorite pastime was to mock her brother’s inability to sing on key.""</li><li>The verb mock — as in the use that inspired the name of the mockingbird — can be simple imitation but, more often, to mock someone is to show disdain through mimicry or parody.  As an adjective, mock indicates a fake or a simulation: ""The design team made the most fabulous mock Eiffel Tower for our staging of An American in Paris."" ""His mock gratitude was, at times, unbearable.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2832,"<ul><li>Commonly used to describe a person who doesn’t pick sides in disputes,  neutral also pegs anything that refuses to be bold: the color beige, bland clothing, people with no preferences on where to eat for dinner.</li><li>Being neutral sounds kind of boring. But neutrality is really important in some cases: Judges, for example, must remain totally neutral when hearing a case. Manners mavens say that it's best to remain neutral when topics like politics and religion come up during a party. And boxers can look to the neutral corners in the ring to escape a punch.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2833,"<ul><li>To persecute is to make someone suffer or to keep them in bad circumstances. In some parts of the world governments or military groups persecute, or punish, people for religious beliefs, often sending them to prisons or work camps.</li><li>You can use the verb persecute to talk about abusive acts against a person or group of people. Persecute is usually used to specify the harm done to a particular group, as when a person is persecuted for his affiliation with a religious group. Those born of a certain race or culture can be targets too. Adolf Hitler became notorious for his orders to persecute the Jewish people.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2834,"<ul><li>If you feel pity, you feel sympathy for someone else's suffering. A documentary on prisoners who have been wrongfully convicted might make you feel pity for them.</li><li>Use pity as a noun or a verb. You feel pity for the really bad singer so you try to look attentive, but then you pity yourself for having to suffer through his terrible rendition of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow.""  We also say something is a pity if it's something to be sad about. It's a pity that your computer crashed right after you finished your paper.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2835,"<ul><li>You reduce something when you lessen its volume, size, or degree. That's why we say when someone goes on a diet, it's because they want to reduce; it's a polite way of suggesting they need to drop pounds and become a smaller size.</li><li>The word reduce first appeared in Old French during the 14th Century, when it meant ""bring back."" From the Latin re, which meant ""back,"" coupled with ducere, meaning ""bring or lead"" — we ended up with reduce. The current meaning, ""to lessen,"" appeared in the late 1700's, drawn from the word's military use, ""reduce to ranks,"" which meant break into smaller units.  Cooks use the word reduce when they reduce a liquid, boiling it down until it has less volume and is thicker.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2836,"<ul><li>A scribe is a term for someone employed to make written copies of documents. Before printing was invented, the busy scribes in a village would write copies of all the legal documents.</li><li>As a noun, scribe has several meanings. It's used as an informal term to refer to journalists. Scribe also refers to a sharply pointed tool used for marking wood or metal to be cut. As a verb, it means ""to score a line on something with a pointed instrument."" The master craftsmen instructed you to scribe a line on the piece of wood where he pointed, to mark the spot where he wanted it cut.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2837,"<ul><li>Temper can refer to a tendency to become unreasonably angry. If you’re not sure whether you have a temper, ask your friends — but don’t get mad if you dislike what they have to say.</li><li>Temper has a number of related yet distinct meanings. In addition to describing a tendency to anger, temper can also refer to one’s mood in general; if you use the word in this sense, you might describe someone's temper as ""angry"" or ""mild."" Temper can also be used as a verb meaning “to restrain.” If you have a nasty temper, you might try tempering your temper by counting to ten whenever you’re tempted to throw a ""temper tantrum,"" or fit.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2838,"<ul><li>The oversized, bejeweled chair on which a king or queen sits is called a throne.</li><li>Monarchs — kings and queens — sit on thrones on special ceremonial occasions, and so do religious figures such as bishops and popes. You can also describe the act of naming a new monarch this way: ""Queen Elizabeth II of England was throned in 1952."" The word throne has its root in the Greek thronos, ""chair or elevated seat."" In ancient Greek mythology, Zeus was said to sit on a special heavenly seat, the Dios thronous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2839,"<ul><li>Unity is being together or at one with someone or something. It's the opposite of being divided.</li><li>This is a word for togetherness or oneness. When the north won the Civil War, it assured the unity of the United States. Sports teams wear uniforms to show unity, and their fans wear team colors for the same reason. When a bunch of people act as one and are on the same page, they're displaying unity. When people are bickering and disorganized, there's no unity. In any group or cause, unity can be hard to find and maintain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U22_2840,"<ul><li>The victor is the winner of a contest, usually one that requires physical skills or strength, like in battle or sports. Calling someone the victor implies that he or she triumphed in a difficult competition.</li><li>The origin of the noun victor is in the Latin word vincere, meaning “conquer.” If you conquer your opponents, in a weekend-long chess showdown, the wrestling match, the beauty contest, the debate, or a 5K run, you are the victor. It means you won — victory is yours. Whenever an opponent is defeated, the winner is the victor.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2841,"<ul><li>Something that is accurate is exact and true. It's important to be accurate in the kitchen with your measurements and in the courtroom with your testimony.</li><li>The adjective accurate comes from the Latin roots ad curare, meaning ""to take care,"" and that is precisely what you do when you make sure something is accurate. You take care to make sure it is perfectly correct: an accurate answer, an accurate headcount, an accurate assessment of the problem. By adding the Latin root in, meaning not, you can make the antonym inaccurate (not accurate).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2842,"<ul><li>Analyze means to study or examine something carefully in a methodical way. If you analyze your math tests from earlier in the year, you'll be able to figure out what you most need to study for the final exam.</li><li>This verb analyze comes from the noun analysis. The noun analysis was in turn borrowed from Greek, from analyein, or ""to dissolve."" If you go into analysis, it means that you will be examined and helped by a mental health professional — who will analyze your particular problems and help you find solutions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2843,"<ul><li>An asteroid is a large, irregularly shaped object in space that orbits our Sun. If one of these giant rocks ends up on a collision course with Earth, we are in for big trouble.</li><li>An asteroid is like a comet. However, while comets are mostly made of ice, asteroids are made up of rock or even metal. This makes them dangerous because they can cause a lot of damage if they collide with a planet. The craters on the Moon were formed by asteroids and some think it was an asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. Around a million asteroids are located between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the “asteroid belt.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2844,"<ul><li>A controversy is a dispute or argument in which people express strong opposing views. When a popular TV show kills off a well-loved character, there's bound to be a lot of controversy.</li><li>Controversy means a quarrel (often public) involving strong disagreement, but the topic can be as unimportant as a new movie. There might be a controversy in the pages of fashion magazines over whether shorter hems are really in style, or about wearing white after Labor Day. Controversy is from the Latin contrōversus, ""turned in an opposite direction,"" from the prefix contrā, ""against,"" plus versus, a form of vertere, ""to turn.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2845,"<ul><li>When something evolves, it changes, or develops over time, like your taste in music and clothes, which evolve as you get older.</li><li>Evolve comes from the Latin word evolvere, ""to unroll"" — the perfect image to keep in mind when thinking of this verb. When something is unrolling or unraveling, it is doing so gradually, not all at once. Evolve describes a development that is taking its time to reach its final destination. Think change with a speed limit. Your taste in music evolved from the nursery rhymes you loved as a little kid to whatever you like today. Even places can evolve, like the old-fashioned coffee shops that evolved into Internet cafés as people began to bring their laptops with them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2846,"<ul><li>A factor is a part or element that contributes to a result. If you only fly budget airlines and refuse to stay anywhere but youth hostels, then money is probably a big factor in your travel plans.</li><li>The word factor doubles as both noun and verb. A factor is an element that influences something, like many factors that contribute to global warming. To factor means to consider something relevant when making a decision or conclusion, like factoring in the weather and traffic when figuring out how long the drive will be. And if it's not relevant? Then you factor it out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2847,"<ul><li>Anything genetic has to do with your genes and DNA. You inherited your mom's eye color because it's genetic.</li><li>Genetic traits run in families: biological families, anyway. Anything genetic is related to your DNA, the material you inherited from your biological parents. Hair color, eye color, and other physical traits are genetic, and so are some diseases. Scientists do genetic research to see how knowing what’s in your genes could help keep you well. If you're healthy, one reason is good genetics.</li></ul>"

Your genome is all the genetic material contained in your 23 pairs of chromosomes, a total of more than 20,000 genes.</li><li>Every organism has its own unique genome. ""The Human Genome Project,"" completed in 2003, was an international effort to identify all the genes in human DNA and to determine the sequences of the 3 billion (yes, billion) base pairs — the smaller units that make up DNA. It took 13 years. Genome research has helped diagnose disease and find genetic markers for certain diseases.</li></ul>"

snowflakes or fingerprints; no two are identical, or exactly
the same.</li><li>Great mind may think alike, but they'll never be identical. Twins, on the other hand, very well may be — if they've come from the same split embryo that is. It makes sense then, that the word identical has linguistic roots in the Latin word idem, meaning ""the same.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2850,"<ul><li>The adjective intellectual describes something related to or using the mind or intellect. Your creative pursuit of singing in a rock band is different from your intellectual interest in 16th-century drama.</li><li>Intellectual is often used to describe intensive reasoning and deep thinking, particularly in relation to subjects that tend to spark deep discussion, such as literature or philosophy. An intellectual is also a noun for a cerebral or brainy person who engages in deep thinking, like Plato, Albert Einstein, or your classmate who can speak at length about the relationship between French existentialism and ice hockey.</li></ul>"

If not, you’re probably in the majority of people.</li><li>In an election, victory usually goes to whoever wins the majority of votes, or more than half of them. The opposite of majority is minority. A majority of the more than one billion Roman Catholics in the world live in Latin America; a small minority of all Roman Catholics live in Asia.</li></ul>"

Every one is a mammal — a hairy, warm-blooded, milk-drinking vertebrate, just like you.</li><li>All mammals are part of the scientific class mammalian, which got its name from the mammary glands used to nourish mammal babies. A note of interest: although a characteristic of mammals is that babies are born live, there’s a group of mammals called monotremes, like the platypus, that lay eggs; but whose young’uns, after they hatch, still get fed mama’s milk. Go figure.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2853,"<ul><li>When you multiply two numbers, you increase the first by the same number that's specified by the second. In other words, when you multiply two by three, you add together three twos.</li><li>When you're doing simple math problems, you can multiply by memorizing lists of times tables — or you can add one number as many times as the second number: four times two is the same as two fours, or eight. Another way to multiply is simply to increase or expand greatly: ""If the diner starts serving homemade pie, their profits will multiply."" The Latin root is multiplicare, ""to increase,"" from multiplex, ""having many folds.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2854,"<ul><li>Puppies are the offspring, or children, of a mamma dog. You're the offspring of your biological parents.</li><li>This is basically another word for children. Baby horses, gorillas, lizards, and humans are all offspring. A woman who gives birth to quadruplets suddenly has a lot of offspring. But this word isn't limited to biological creations — you could say that a project you've been laboring over is your offspring. Albert Einstein's offspring included many groundbreaking theories, and the scientists who followed up on Einstein's ideas are considered his intellectual offspring.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2855,"<ul><li>A pesticide is a bug-killing poison. You may have to resort to using a pesticide to battle the ants that have invaded your kitchen, even if you hate killing any creature.</li><li>Pesticides are most often used to ward off insects or small animals living uninvited in a person's house, or in a garden or on a farm, when they are nibbling on plants or flowers. The Latin suffix cide means ""killer,"" and in pesticide, it's combined with the English word pest, which means just what it sounds like — a troublesome annoyance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U23_2856,"<ul><li>The on-off spigot regulates the flow of water into your bathtub. When a government regulates an industry, they set standards the industry must follow. To regulate means to impose control.</li><li>Regulate shares a root with the word, regular. When the transit authority regulates a train schedule, it makes sure trains arrive on a more regular schedule. The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated –– before a drug can be marketed, it must be tested. On a more personal level, if you want to regulate your digestive system, try eating more fiber... or prunes!</li></ul>"

You can reinforce your roof by putting some extra supports under it.</li><li>Besides a physical structure, there are many things you can reinforce. If you want to reinforce a message, you can say it louder, rephrase and repeat it or give examples of what you expect. You use dog biscuits to reinforce certain behaviors in your dog. Bad experiences will reinforce your fears, good ones your hopes. And when military leaders reinforce their troops, they send additional soldiers to the front.</li></ul>"

When you saw the pretty new girl at school smiling at you, you were so stricken you walked right into a wall.</li><li>Stricken means ""affected,"" whether it's in a good way — being so stricken by spring fever that you can't stop singing and goofing around — or bad, like being stricken by a real fever and a sore throat and the chills and. . . you get the idea. You can also be stricken by fear, like a family so stricken by fear of bedbugs that they cancelled their hotel reservation and just slept in their car.</li></ul>"

Even places that can't be seen or touched, like imaginations, are called vast, because of the endless ideas that come out of them. Someone with a vast imagination is very creative, and a place with a vast landscape is very large. Possibilities are vast, and so are the vocabularies of the world, filling vast volumes.</li></ul>"

Many vegetarians eat plenty of fruits and vegetables — but others subsist on pizza and mac and cheese.</li><li>This is a word that has to do with diet — what people eat. Vegetarians avoid meat, usually for health reasons, for environmental reasons, or because they believe it's wrong to kill animals for food. Vegetarians will eat some animal products, like eggs and dairy, but vegans won't. Both vegetarian and vegan diets are becoming more common. Many animals are vegetarians, including our close relative, the gorilla.</li></ul>"

Many people start the day with a bowl of cereal.</li><li>You might keep your sugar in a sugar bowl, or stir up a batch of brownies in a big mixing bowl. In either case, you've got a wide dish with curved sides that's open on the top. You can call other things with a similar shape bowls too, like a toilet bowl or the bowl of a spoon.

And if someone calls you dense, they think nothing can get into your thick skull.</li><li>Dense comes from the Latin densus which means thick and cloudy. In general, the word means packed tight and gives the sense that something is difficult to get through. Text can be dense in two different ways: when the words are packed closely together on the page, and when the text is filled with big words and complicated thoughts. Either way, reading dense text is just no fun.</li></ul>"

If you really want the lead role in a play and you try to bribe the director to give it to you, she might say, “Have you no dignity?”</li><li>Someone with dignity carries herself well. If you lose an election, and you say nasty things about your opponent and try to undermine her, you are acting without dignity. But if you graciously congratulate her and accept the results, then you are behaving in a dignified manner. We also talk about human dignity, which is an idea of what separates humans from animals. Human Rights activists believe that everyone has the right to live with dignity.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2865,"<ul><li>If your basketball team is undefeated, you could say that it was able to dominate the competition. To dominate means to be in control or have the power to defeat.</li><li>Dominate is related to the word domain — which means home. While these words may not seem all that similar, when you are the master of a home or thing, you dominate it. If you get angry, it is wise to not let your feelings dominate you or your actions. Dominate can also mean to be most prominent. If in the woods around your house, oak trees are the most common, you could say that ""oak trees dominate the forest.""</li></ul>"

If you are zealous about the political causes you believe in, you will be hostile to any suggestion that the other side of the argument is reasonable.</li><li>Hostile comes from the Latin word hostis, for enemy, and you can hear its relation to the word hostage.  But you don't have to be from a warring nation to be hostile. You can talk about a hostile nation, a hostile takeover, a hostile remark, or a hostile attitude. Some synonyms are inimical, antagonistic, unfavorable, unfriendly.</li></ul>"

Your attempt to bypass security with a fake ID was unsuccessful, and your guise as a pizza deliverer was likewise ineffective.</li><li>Likewise is an adverb with three different senses. One is ""similarly."" You were unimpressed with your brother's poetry, and likewise unimpressed with his taste in music. Likewise can also mean ""in addition,"" and ""equally."" Your new t-shirts sold well at the beach boutique, and likewise they sold well on line. If you want to tell someone you feel the way he does, say, ""I feel likewise.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2871,"<ul><li>At its simplest, a machine is an invention that does a job better and faster and more powerfully than a human being.</li><li>Despite being man-made we’ve come to think of the word machine as the very opposite of human. The Machine Age we live in is considered impersonal and overwhelming, and anything machine-like is often considered soulless or even dangerous. (Witness the countless fantasies of robots taking over the world.) Human beings working together, like ""the cogs of a machine,"" can become more powerful than a single person. That's why sports teams or political organizations are often described as ""well-oiled machines.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2872,"<ul><li>If your doctor prescribes something for you to take, it's medication. Medication is another way to say ""medicine"" or ""drug."" Your poison ivy rash might be so bad that you need to take medication to stop the itching.</li><li>People need medication for all sorts of illnesses and disorders throughout their lives, from headache medication to medication for cancer treatment. In the fifteenth century, the word meant ""medical treatment of a disease or wound,"" from the Latin medicationem, ""healing or cure,"" with its root in medicus, which means both ""healing"" and ""physician.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2873,"<ul><li>If something is obscure, it's vague and hard to see. Be careful if you're driving in heavy rain — the painted lines can be obscure.</li><li>Obscure comes from Latin obscurus, which can mean ""dark, dim,"" ""unclear, hard to understand,"" or ""insignificant, humble."" We tend to use obscure in the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and probably insignificant. Obscure can also be used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a debate, your embarrassing twitches and shaking hands can obscure your argument.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2874,"<ul><li>When you oppress someone, you use your authority to keep them down. If you oppress people long enough, they might decide to fight back and then decide to oppress YOU.</li><li>There is a saying that ""power corrupts,"" meaning that once someone gains power, they tend to misuse it in self-serving or brutal ways. Tyrants tend to oppress those beneath them, by limiting their rights. In the fairy tale Rapunzel, the evil old woman tried to oppress Rapunzel by keeping her locked in a tower. Another use of oppress means to cause to suffer. If the ninety degree heat outside will oppress you, you should stay inside in the air conditioning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2875,"<ul><li>A peel is the covering of a fruit or vegetable. Some peels are thick and easy to remove, like an orange peel, while others might be more stubborn, like the thin peel on a potato.</li><li>When you remove an apple peel or the peel of an eggplant, you peel it. You can peel anything with a rind or skin, especially things you can eat, like shrimp and onions. There are non-edible things to peel, like stickers and old wallpaper too. You can also figuratively peel something: ""I had to peel off my wet clothes and put dry ones on before I stopped shivering."" The Latin root, pilare, means ""to strip of hair.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2876,"<ul><li>A prescription is an order written by a doctor for someone to get a drug that is not available without this permission. If you get a bad ear infection, you'll need a prescription for antibiotics.</li><li>When your doctor writes a prescription, she's advising you to take a medication that you can only get from a pharmacist. You can refer to the paper with the drug's name and the doctor's signature and the bottle of medicine as a prescription. Sometimes prescription is used in a non-medical way to simply mean a suggestion or recommendation, like laughter and friends — a great prescription for chasing away the blues.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2877,"<ul><li>The process of advancement and the way things move in the positive direction of improvement is called  progress. If you got a B on your last test and a B+ on this one, that's progress.</li><li>If you're moving toward a goal, you're making progress too. On a long trip, it feels like you're barely making progress, but every hour you've driven another 60 miles towards your destination. Or, the news reported recent progress in peace talks between the two feuding nations. Have you ever heard someone say that you can't stop progress? That means that things keep advancing and getting more complicated. Place the accent on the second syllable if you use it as a verb. Let's progress to the next stage.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2878,"<ul><li>Something that looks like sand, feels like sand, or is covered in sand is sandy. A sandy beach is lovely; a sandy bed is just uncomfortable.</li><li>If your dog tracks sand indoors and spreads it all over the place, you've got a sandy house. If your sister's hair is the brownish color of sand, you can describe it as sandy too. And if you spill your ingredients when you're making a cake, you might realize that sugar and flour both look a little sandy when they're on the floor. Sandy comes from the Old English sandig, ""of the nature of sand.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2879,"<ul><li>A shortage is a lack of something, especially a severe lack. A drought is a shortage of water.</li><li>When there's a shortage, there's not enough of something. If you don't have enough money to pay your bills, you have a shortage of money. A bad football team may have a shortage of good players. This kind of shortage is like a deficit or shortfall. A shortage can also be a severe dearth of something, like a famine, which is a lack of food. If there's a drought because of little rainfall, that's a serious shortage.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U24_2880,"<ul><li>If you're skillful, you're very good at some particular thing. A skillful debater might have a successful career in politics, while a skillful baker could make the best brownies you've ever tasted.</li><li>Skillful people tend to be experts at something, like a skillful ping pong player or a skillful pianist. You can also use this adjective to mean ""done in an expert way,"" so you could praise your sister's skillful snow fort building or your brother's skillful video gaming. The adjective skillful comes from skill, which is rooted in the Old Norse skil, ""distinction, discernment, or adjustment.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2881,"<ul><li>A machine that can fly, held aloft in the air, is called an aircraft. Airplanes and helicopters are two types of aircraft.</li><li>Some kinds of aircraft, primarily helicopters, use rotors or spinning blades to fly, while the lift of other aircraft comes from jet engines or the shape of the aircraft's wing. Still other aircraft, including hot air balloons, use buoyancy — generally a gas that's lighter than air — for lift and flight. Balloons were actually the first vehicles referred to as aircraft, along with airships. The word was adapted from nautical terminology.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2882,"<ul><li>A celebrity is a very famous person. If you single-handedly save an entire family from a burning building, you'll become a local celebrity.</li><li>Celebrity comes directly from the Latin celebritatum, meaning famous, and is related to the verb celebrate which means to honor something with the proper ritual. We usually use celebrity now when we talk about entertainment stars, but someone doesn't have to be on the supermarket tabloids to be a celebrity. Celebrity can also be used to mean the state of fame. If you are seeking celebrity, develop a thick skin for nasty rumors.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2883,"<ul><li>Concrete is that pourable mix of cement, water, sand, and gravel that hardens into a super-strong building material. Sidewalks, foundations, and highways are all made of concrete.</li><li>Though people use the words cement and concrete as if they were the same, they're not. Concrete has cement in it, but also includes other materials; cement is what binds concrete together. Construction workers hate when kids write their names in concrete before it hardens: once concrete hardens, it's going to be solid for a long time. When used as an adjective, concrete also means solid. If you've got concrete plans for Saturday, then you have a definite plan.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2884,"<ul><li>If you make decisions quickly, you are someone who is decisive. A decisive event can settle something, like a war.</li><li>People who are wishy-washy are the opposite of decisive: being decisive means you don't waffle or take forever to make up your mind, and then you stick by what you decided. People admire politicians, coaches, and friends who are decisive. In sports, if a home run won the game, that was the decisive run. When you reach a crisis point in life — when things are going to change one way or the other — you've reached a decisive moment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2885,"<ul><li>If lots of people respect you and you're known around town as a wise and intelligent person whose opinion matters, then you're esteemed.</li><li>Esteemed comes from the verb esteem, which means ""to think valuable."" If you are esteemed, then people think you're a valuable person to have around, and have a lot of respect for you. If you're hosting a dinner party with a special guest, an elderly man who has traveled the world and written many books, you could introduce him as your esteemed guest.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2886,"<ul><li>For someone who is honest and follows good moral standards, use the adjective ethical. An ethical teacher will grade your papers honestly — even if she catches you sticking your tongue out at her.</li><li>Ethical comes from the Greek ethos ""moral character"" and describes a person or behavior as right in the moral sense - truthful, fair, and honest. Sometimes the word is used for people who follow the moral standards of their profession. An ethical lawyer or doctor does not try to take advantage of the client or patient's unfortunate situation. If something has happened and you are not sure what the right thing to do is, you are having an ethical dilemma.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2887,"<ul><li>Something that no longer exists and has no living representative is extinct. Dinosaurs are extinct. Polar bears may become extinct. Sadly, history teachers who force their students to memorize long lists of dates are in no danger of becoming extinct.</li><li>You often hear of a species being extinct: there are no living representatives of the species left. But extinct also describes something that has gone out or grown cold, as in a dormant volcano ""extinct volcano"" or a tobacco pipe whose flame has died out ""extinct pipe."" That’s because extinct comes from the Latin extinguere/exstinguere for ""extinguish."" Originally extinct referred to fires that died out (were extinguished). Its meaning grew to encompass a family line and then a species.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2888,"<ul><li>Hardy means tough––if you're hardy, you don't get tired easily and can endure hardship. People who don't catch cold often attribute this fact to their coming from hardy farming stock.</li><li>Before 1200, hardy indicated boldness and daring in battle and was probably influenced by hard. Warriors are hardy: they’re brave and strong and don’t easily tire. Plants and animals can also be hardy if they can survive harsh weather or poor growing conditions. When planting a lawn, you should pick hardy species of grass, which will survive droughts and come back after long, cold winters.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2889,"<ul><li>An institute is an organization or association designed to study or promote something. If you're interested in politics, you might want to do an internship at one of Washington D.C.'s many political research institutes.</li><li>While you may have heard of an institute, whether it’s the National Institute for Art Advancement or the National Cancer Institute, you may not know institute in its verb form. To institute something means to establish or advance it. You might institute the hiring of Spanish-speakers at your company, or, if workers complain about being overworked, you might institute a new policy on taking breaks.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2890,"<ul><li>Jealousy is that unpleasant emotion you feel when you think someone’s trying to take what’s yours. Jealousy might creep up on you if someone flirts with your sweetie or copies your unique style.</li><li>Jealousy is called the ""green-eyed monster"" because it can make people obsessed with how they compare to others, always trying to beat their rivals by calling attention to what they have and seeing if the rivals have any reaction. Don't confuse jealousy with envy, which can sometimes be a slightly more positive emotion. If you envy your friend's athleticism, you wish you had it too, but you also admire her dedication.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2891,"<ul><li>To migrate means to move from one place to another, sometimes part of a back-and-forth pattern, and sometimes to stay.</li><li>When we think of the word migrate we think of movement from place to place. Sometimes that movement is seasonal, as when birds migrate north in summer and south in winter. But sometimes a person or group will migrate from one place to another with the intention of settling there. In both cases, there is a definite shift in locales, one temporary, the other permanent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2892,"<ul><li>If you plant a seed, water it daily and give it lots of light, you nurture it until it is ready to be transplanted outside. When you nurture a person or thing, you care for it and help it to grow.</li><li>After a fight with your friend, you may have to nurture the relationship a little until you're close again. Use the phrase ""nature versus nurture"" to help you remember the word. Nature is a baby just out of the womb. Nurture is how that baby is raised or taken care of. Once the child is older, you may wonder if its love of reading is nature or nurture — is it natural born or is it because you read to the baby every night.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2893,"<ul><li>Anything that's located above you is overhead — it’s literally over your head. An overhead compartment on an airplane is a good place to stash your carry-on suitcase. Overhead is also the money it takes to run a business.</li><li>Overhead works as both an adjective and an adverb: ""An overhead view of the football field gives the spectators a better idea of the game, and a drone flying overhead is the perfect way to achieve it."" There's also an overhead stroke in tennis, an overhead projector showing a movie in science class, and the overhead, or up-front expenses, that a new business requires.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2894,"<ul><li>A principle is a kind of rule, belief, or idea that guides you. You can also say a good, ethical person has a lot of principles.</li><li>In general, a principle is some kind of basic truth that helps you with your life. ""Be fair"" is a principle that guides (or should guide) most people and businesses. A politician who tries to do the right thing rather than win votes is acting on principle. A person who has principles is a good, decent person. On the other hand, if you say someone has no principles, that means they're dishonest, corrupt, or evil.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2895,"<ul><li>Rural means ""relating to or characteristic of the country or the people who live there."" If you move to a rural area, you won't see a lot of skyscrapers or taxis — but you'll probably see a lot of trees.</li><li>You may have known people who live on country roads––mail to their houses must be addressed to a rural route, abbreviated as RR. Rustic is a near synonym but emphasizes the supposed qualities of country people: being simple, awkward, and even rude and rough. The adjective rural descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Latin rūrālis, from rūs ""the country.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2896,"<ul><li>A secluded place is isolated, away from other people. It's quiet, and there's not a lot going on.</li><li>Sometimes you need to get away from it all to someplace where no one will find you. What you seek is a secluded area where you can be alone. A secluded spot conjures the image of someplace removed from the intrusions of life. A writer might want to be secluded so she can get work done, and a couple might want to be secluded so they can spend time together. When you're secluded, there aren't many other people or distractions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2897,"<ul><li>A species is a distinct group of animals or plants that have common characteristics and can breed with each other. Your poodle and your bulldog are the same species, but your hamster and your goldfish are not.</li><li>All members of the same species have similar genes and can interbreed and produce offspring. A subspecies is a division of a species, and a genus includes several different species. Biologists use these categories to classify organisms, usually with Latin names like Canis familiaris, or ""domestic dog."" In Middle English, species meant ""a classification in logic,"" borrowed from the Latin word meaning ""kind or appearance,"" from the root of specere, ""to see.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2898,"<ul><li>A swamp is an area that floods every year because the land is low. Watch out for alligators if you visit  Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana, the largest swamp in the United States.</li><li>Anyone who has spent time in a busy restaurant kitchen has heard harried chefs cry, ""I'm in the weeds!"" Such people are in a different kind of swamp — the challenging environment in which too many things need to be done in too short a time. Another way of saying this is, ""I'm swamped."" Here swamp is a verb that describes being stuck in a seemingly endless situation — you feel like you're stuck in the squishy mud of a real swamp.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2899,"<ul><li>The verb traverse means to travel across an extended area. ""Her dream was to traverse the country by car, so she could meet new people and see all the kitschy sites — like the giant roadside tire in Michigan or the shoe house in Pennsylvania.""</li><li>The verb traverse can also mean ""to span,"" to span a physical space or time. ""The bridge traversed the river, linking the two cities."" Traverse can be used for any crossing, but it often is used when implying the crossing will be difficult. ""She was exhausted from traveling in the snowy conditions, but she still had to traverse an icy bridge before she would arrive safely home.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U25_2900,"<ul><li>If you're fascinated by monkey business or just love horsing around, you might consider a career in zoology — the scientific study of animals.</li><li>According to some usage experts, most of us mispronounce the word zoology. The first syllable of this noun is correctly pronounced with a long o sound, as in toe, rather than the ""oo"" in zoo. Yet our error is considered acceptable because if you're going to study animal life and behavior, one of the best places to do it is at the zoo.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2901,"<ul><li>Accordingly means in accord with, or in correspondence with something. If you learn that your so-called best friend is spreading nasty rumors about you, act accordingly and stop being her friend.</li><li>Accordingly is the adverb form of accord, which means harmony, or agreement. We often use the phrase ""act accordingly,"" which just means to behave in a logical manner based on what you feel, learn, or are told. If you are half-starved after being lost in the woods for three days, when you come across a house with a full kitchen, you will act accordingly. Accordingly can also mean ""therefore."" You were hungry, accordingly you ate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2902,"<ul><li>On a boat, an anchor is a heavy object attached to a rope. You toss it overboard, it sinks to the bottom, and your vessel doesn't move. Anchor has the sense of what holds something in place.</li><li>When you anchor a bookshelf to the wall, you affix it to the wall so it won't come down. The anchor of a relay race is the last person to run. It's their job to hold the team's lead. And on televised news, the anchor is the person who is front and center delivering the current events, the one who draws viewers to the news on that particular station.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2903,"<ul><li>A cause makes an effect, and you're likely to hear the phrase ""cause and effect"" when people are trying to analyze how things happen.</li><li>Cause can also mean something worth fighting for — like social justice or animal rights. You might raise money for a good cause, like ending poverty.  Once the doctor determines the cause of your illness, she might make it her personal cause to discover a cure. The verb cause is all about the action of producing an effect, like when you slice onions and it causes your eyes to water.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2904,"<ul><li>Context means the setting of a word or event. If your friend is furious at you for calling her your worst enemy, remind her that the context of those remarks was Opposite Day.</li><li>Context comes from the Latin for how something is made. It was first used to talk about writing, as in ""the beautiful phrase occurs in the context of the concluding paragraph."" We use it now to talk about any circumstance in which something happens. You might say that you can't understand what happens without looking at the context. When someone takes your words but makes it sound like you meant something else, they've taken your words out of context.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2905,"<ul><li>To designate is to give something a specific status. If you designate your house an opera-free zone, it means that you've officially declared that no opera is allowed to be played there.</li><li>To give a person or thing an official status is to designate it as something, like when you designate a meeting place if members of your group get lost at the amusement park. Sometimes, it can carry responsibility or an assignment, like when your teammates designate you as the captain. It can also show a category, like when you designate certain books to the humor section of the bookstore where you work.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2906,"<ul><li>Distort means to twist out of shape. When you look at a tree through a twisting kaleidoscope, you distort its image, making its branches and leaves look wavy and misshapen.</li><li>Distort is a verb that means to change the shape of something. You can distort pretzel dough by twisting it into the shape of an ""S"" instead of a normal pretzel shape. You can also distort, or change, the meaning of something. When one distorts the truth, it might not be an out-and-out lie; it could just be an exaggeration — like telling your pals you caught a six-foot tuna when you actually landed a six-inch minnow.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2907,"<ul><li>A dock is a structure that's made for bringing boats or ships in to the shore and loading or unloading them of goods or passengers. The small dock behind your lake house might be mainly used for launching your canoe.</li><li>Smaller docks are wooden planks that jut into the water — boats can pull up and be tied or anchored there. Larger docks in harbors might have gates enclosing areas of water where ships can be repaired or cargo unloaded. When boats dock, they pull up to a dock or a pier. You can also use the verb form of dock to mean ""cut off,"" as when a farmer docks an animal's tail or a boss docks a worker's wages.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2908,"<ul><li>The general meaning of energy is the ability to be active. If you have a lot of energy, it means you like to be active. If you plan a low-energy day, it means a day of lounging around.</li><li>Energy is from Greek energeia ""activity, operation,"" from energos ""active, effective,"" from en ""in"" plus ergon ""work."" Specialized senses of the word energy include the power that comes from sources such as heat or electricity, and the ability of sources such as heat or light to do work. In physics, an erg is the centimeter-gram-second unit used to measure the amount of energy or the amount of work done.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2909,"<ul><li>Use the adjective frequent to describe something done often and at regular intervals. If your family likes to read, you may be a frequent visitor to the library. You may also have frequent arguments with your family about who gets to read a book first.</li><li>The adjective form of frequent also means regularly and often encountered. If you live on the windward side of Oahu, Hawaii, you may experience frequent rain showers. As a verb, frequent means to be a regular visitor or to patronize. You can frequent the trails of the National Parks. You may prefer to frequent locally-owned businesses.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B05_U26_2911,"<ul><li>Genuine things are true or authentic. When you're talking about people, being genuine has to do with being sincere.</li><li>This word has to do with things and people that are true. A genuine blonde is a real blonde — no hair dye involved. A genuine friend is a real friend you can trust when the chips are down. Genuine feelings are real feelings — not fake feelings put on as a show. A genuine hundred dollar bill is the real McCoy, not a counterfeit bill. When something is the real thing, it's genuine.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2912,"<ul><li>Grease is the thick oil you use to make a machine work more smoothly. It's also the shiny, slick substance produced by cooking something in fat, like the grease on that fried chicken you made.</li><li>As a verb, grease means to make something slick and oily so it can move more easily: ""You should grease the hinges to stop the door from creaking."" As a noun grease is the kind of oil or fat that's solid at room temperature, whether it's the grease you use to repair a car engine or the grease you use to deep fry onion rings. Colloquially, when you grease someone's palm, you offer them money as a bribe.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2913,"<ul><li>Why do you go to school? For knowledge, of course. To have knowledge means to know or be aware of things.</li><li>Knowledge is understanding gained through learning or experience. You read a recipe to gain knowledge about baking rhubarb pie. When it burns in the oven, experience gives you the knowledge that you need to stop doing three things at once. Fields like biology, math, art, medicine, and others have huge bodies of knowledge. Knowledge can mean information and also deeper understanding. You can use this word as a disclaimer too, as in ""To my knowledge, my sister walked the dog.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2914,"<ul><li>If you omit one member of the class when you're handing out valentines, it's going to make that person feel terrible. To omit something is to leave it out, to forget or overlook it.</li><li>The verb omit comes from the Latin word omittere, ""to let go or to lay aside,"" which is exactly what it means. When you omit an ingredient you need for your brownie recipe from the grocery list, you've accidentally left off an important item. You can also deliberately omit something, which you'd do if you didn't include your least favorite cousin when you invited your relatives to a family reunion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2915,"<ul><li>When you offset something—say, the price of gas—you find a way to make up for it. My new car's ability to get fifty miles per gallon offset the rise in the price of gas. Offset functions as both a noun and a verb.</li><li>Okay, let's talk turkey. The Duke's lack of height was offset by his enormous wig. Even without shoes, he towered above most people, because his wig alone was five feet tall. The cost of the wig—close to $10,000—was easily offset by its quality: it was worth every cent. The inconvenience of the blizzard was offset by the joy of not having to go to school or work—or even get out of bed. The joy was what you might call an offset.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2916,"<ul><li>When things overlap, part or all of one thing covers part or all of the other, like roofing shingles or flat noodles in a lasagna dish.</li><li>Not only can things overlap, but schedules can, too. If you accidentally schedule your doctor's appointment and your dentist appointment at the same time, they overlap, which is unfortunate because you can't be in two places at once. Philosophies and perspectives overlap when they share certain points or ideas in common.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2917,"<ul><li>Anything that's secondhand has been used before. Your secondhand boots may look brand new, but they were owned by someone else before you bought them.</li><li>Things that aren't new are secondhand, so you might buy a secondhand car from your grandma or shop at a secondhand clothing store to get good deals. You can also use this adjective to mean ""not from an original or primary source."" If your sister tells you that her best friend told her that he saw a famous movie star at the coffee shop, that's secondhand information.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2918,"<ul><li>If you have an ability that required practice, training, or experience, you have a skill. His welding skill allowed him to create wonderful pieces of art out of metal plumbing pipes. He called his best work ""Peace Pipes.""</li><li>Chess is a game of skill, but Old Maid is a game of luck. The noun skill comes from an Old Norse word, skil, which means distinction. His swimming skills left a lot to be desired: he flailed around in the pool, churning up water like an egg beater. It kept him from drowning, but it didn't look pretty. You're supposed to learn basic math and reading skills in elementary school.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2919,"<ul><li>A thin opening or groove in something is a slot. You can put letters and postcards through the mail slot at the post office.</li><li>A gum ball machine has a slot for inserting a coin, and some front doors have a special slot for mail carriers to put mail in. A screwdriver fits neatly into the slot on top of a screw. Another kind of slot is a space in a schedule or calendar: ""I have a half-hour slot on Thursday for our meeting."" In the 14th century, a slot was ""the hollow above the breastbone.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U26_2920,"<ul><li>Tactic is another word for a maneuver or method. If begging doesn't convince your parents to raise your allowance, you might want to try a different tactic—like doing all your chores without being asked.</li><li>English-speakers have been talking about tactics since at least 1640, when this word was first recorded. A tactic is just a way to do something, a plan, or an approach. Generals have to have a good grasp on military tactics to win a battle; football teams have to use strong defensive tactics to keep the other guys from scoring. One time-tested tactic for winning over a teacher? Always turn your homework in on time!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2921,"<ul><li>If it's beneficial, then it's good for you — or for something. Studying is beneficial to your grades. Exercise is beneficial to your health.</li><li>Spend any time with Italians and you will hear the word bene over and over. It comes straight from Latin, and Italians use it as often as we use ""good;"" it can mean ""fine,"" ""okay,"" ""yummy,"" or ""kind and well behaved."" Bene gives us beneficial, but also benefit, beneficent, benevolent and more well-meaning words.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2922,
4000EEW_B05_U27_2923,"<ul><li>Capacity describes your ability to do something or the amount something can hold. If your bird cage is at full capacity, you can't stuff one more feathered friend in there without causing birdie claustrophobia.</li><li>From the Latin word capacitatem meaning “breadth, capacity,” capacity is a noun that in the simplest sense means ""ability"" or ""capability"": the capability of a room to hold a certain number of people, the ability of a law to change crime rates, your ability to pick up foreign languages. You might hear about factories working at ""full capacity"" — that means at full speed, producing as much as they possibly can.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2924,"<ul><li>The word comparative deals, naturally, with comparisons, looking at characteristics of two or more things. For example, you might study a course such as comparative literature, which examines works from two or more cultures or languages.</li><li>Coming from the Latin verb comparāre, ""to compare,"" comparative worked its way into Late Middle English as an adjectival form indicating comparison. In the comparative form, the adjective either ends in ""-er"" (my hands are smaller than yours are) or uses the word ""more"" before it (you are more qualified than the other applicants are). The word also can offer an estimate rather than an absolute.  You might be a comparative beginner in cooking class, but your ham still won the prize.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2925,"<ul><li>When you want to describe something that includes all or most details, you can use the adjective comprehensive. If you get the comprehensive treatment at a spa, it might include massage, manicure and a facial.</li><li>Comprehensive is from Latin comprehensivus, from comprehensus, the source of English comprehend. In business, comprehensive insurance is insurance that covers a broad range, offering protection against most risks of a certain type. It applies mainly to car insurance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2926,"<ul><li>To conserve is to save or protect something, like money, or your energy on a long run. People are also encouraged to conserve energy by turning off lights and not cranking the air conditioner.</li><li>Conserve is from the Latin for ""to keep, preserve, guard"" (conservare). Con means ""together,"" so ""together"" we can ""serve"" the planet by not doing doughnuts in the wetlands on our jet skis. You can conserve the planet or a little something for yourself —  you might conserve hot water so you can wash your hair later, or try to conserve your old bedroom when you go off to college (and your mom is ready for a home office).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2927,"<ul><li>The word crucial describes something that is important or essential to success, like the crucial dress rehearsals that ensure everything will run smoothly on your play's opening night.</li><li>Usage experts insist that the word crucial should be used only to describe something that is truly critical for solving a problem or for resolving a situation, such as a crucial vote that determines a final outcome. In this case the crucial vote is decisive: it determines the outcome. But the word has gained popularity as a way to say that something is important. You might hear someone say, for example, that it is crucial to allow employees to vote on the new schedule to make them feel like they’re part of the process. In this case the sense is “important”: nothing decisive is taking place.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2928,"<ul><li>The adjective cumulative describes the total amount of something when it's all added together. Eating a single chocolate doughnut is fine, but the cumulative effect of eating them all day is that you'll probably feel sick.</li><li>The origin of cumulative is helpful in remembering the meaning; it comes from the Latin cumulatus for ""to heap."" If something is cumulative, it is heaped together so it can be counted up to get a total number. The cumulative snowfall for the whole winter isn't just the amount of snow that fell in one month, but rather the number of inches that fell every month that winter to get the total, cumulative, amount.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2929,"<ul><li>You are making a deposit when you put money into your bank account. In that sentence, deposit is a noun, but you could express the same action using deposit as a verb. You deposit money into your bank account.</li><li>The verb deposit can be used to refer to anything that you put down or in place. If you're carrying your keys and groceries from the car, you may deposit those items on the counter. Just be careful you don't end up playing ""where are my keys"" in the morning, if the counter is not your usual place for depositing them. You can also use deposit when nature does the placing. You find a deposit of gold in the mountain rock or there is sediment deposited at the bottom of a river.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2930,"<ul><li>To distribute is to disperse widely, hand out, or spread around. While you're still snoozing, the paper boy is busy distributing the newspaper all over the neighborhood.</li><li>This verb was first recorded in the early 15th century and has its roots in the Latin distributus, meaning “to divide.” Think of dividing up the last cookies in the cookie jar and passing them out to all your friends. Distribute can also mean to space out or arrange in a particular order — you'd want to distribute the chairs in even lines across the floor when setting up for a concert, for example.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2931,"<ul><li>An equator is a circle that divides the surface of an object into two equal halves. If you're freezing up there in Iceland, get yourself on down closer to the earth's equator, where it's nice and warm.</li><li>An equator is an invisible line that divides a globe into two parts, north and south. To remember equator, recall the root ""equa"" from the Latin word aequus, meaning ""equal."" An equator makes things ""equal."" If you drew a line that divided a globe into two parts that were not equal, the line couldn't be called an equator.

If you live at the North Pole and you're buddy lives at the South, meet halfway, somewhere along the equator—perhaps in Brazil, for Carnaval.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2932,"<ul><li>Something so unusual that it must be from some unfamiliar place is exotic. An exotic pet might be a panda, instead of a hamster. An exotic trip might be a journey to the Galapagos Islands, instead of to Orlando's Sea World.</li><li>Animals and people, or sensory things like food and smells, are often called exotic when they are from far-away lands. In the 16th century, exotic came into use — from Latin and Greek words for ""foreign,"" which came, in turn, from exo-, meaning ""outside."" By the 17th century it was also being used to describe things that are striking or unusual. Even when the words strange and alien are sometimes used as synonyms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2933,"<ul><li>Federal refers to the national government. The voting age is determined by the federal government while the driving age is decided on a state by state basis.</li><li>Before the Constitution was ratified, the United States was a loose confederation of states, with no real federal government. The Constitution created a stronger federal government but to this day, there is a conflict between those who want power to go to the states and those who support federal control. States don't seem to mind federal subsidies though.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2934,"<ul><li>A formation is an arrangement of people or things. Planes flying in formation make a deliberate, specific pattern in the sky.</li><li>Some formations are on purpose, or deliberate — like military troops marching in formation or a cheerleading squad arranging itself in formation. Others just arrange themselves in a particular way by chance, like a striking cloud formation overhead. You can also talk about the formation — or establishment — of something less physical, like the formation of a new government. The Latin root, formationem, means ""a shaping.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2935,"<ul><li>Frequency measures how often things repeat over time. City buses often reach stops at a frequency of every 15 minutes, unless it's snowing or raining really hard. In that case, the frequency will slow.</li><li>You probably know the word frequent, a synonym for often. So, it is tempting to think frequency describes something that happens often. However, this isn't true: frequency describes any rate of time at which something repeats. For example, from Earth, Halley's Comet is visible at a frequency of 76 years — it's not frequent, but it is on schedule.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2936,"<ul><li>An objective is something you plan to achieve. A military objective is the overall plan for a mission. The objective for a bake sale is to raise money. If your objective is to learn a new word, you have succeeded.</li><li>An objective is the point of something. If you don’t understand the objective of a class, then you don’t know what you were supposed to learn. The word itself is often used in business or work. Another meaning of objective is “looking at things in a detached, impartial, fact-based way.” If a police officer falls in love with a witness, it might be hard for her to stay objective. The word comes from the Latin ob ""against"" + jacere ""to throw.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2937,"<ul><li>Oxygen is air, the stuff we breathe, the thing that makes our lives possible. It is an element, a basic chemical found on the earth.</li><li>In fact, we don't breathe pure oxygen; our air is about 20 percent oxygen. Still, oxygen is everywhere—it’s the third most common element on earth. Usually, the word is used in scientific contexts. Still, when someone has a big personality and likes to be the center of attention, we say, they ""take all the oxygen out of the room."" That means they are a blowhard and attention hog. If they really took your oxygen, you’d be dead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2938,"<ul><li>A rainforest is a dense, damp forest with a huge number of different kinds of plants and animals. Scientists believe there may be millions of species in rainforests that haven't been discovered yet.</li><li>There are two kinds of rainforests, tropical and temperate. Temperate rainforests are much smaller, and there are fewer of them. Most rainforests in the United States (in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska) are temperate. Tropical rainforests are remarkably wet and warm, with frequent rain and thick growth of trees and plants. Hawaii has the US's only tropical rainforests.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2939,"<ul><li>In the game of capture-the-flag, running toward your flag screaming is not a good strategy. A strategy is any plan you make to achieve a goal.</li><li>The word strategy was developed to describe plans people made for war, and strategies often rely on certain chief assets––the British strategy for world domination relied on its naval superiority, our strategy for this game relies on the other team's poor level of fitness. After they're exhausted, we go for the goal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U27_2940,
4000EEW_B05_U28_2941,"<ul><li>To avail means to take advantage of an opportunity, the way you'd be crazy not to avail yourself of a chocolate milkshake on Free Milkshake Day at your local ice cream parlor.</li><li>Sometimes avail is used to mean ""help,"" and in that case it can be used in a sentence like ""Nothing seemed to avail me, not even winning the lottery."" More often though, avail shows up in the company of ""oneself of,"" as in the sentence, ""I hope you avail yourself of my advice, because I'm very wise."" It might seem like a complicated way to use a verb, but it's one you should avail yourself of if you're hoping to impress someone.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2942,"<ul><li>If you can't define a word, turn to the dictionary. That's always the best way to learn the definition. Likewise, anything you can describe completely is something you can define.</li><li>The early French and Latin roots of the verb mean something closer to ""to limit"" or ""to create a boundary,"" but this is really what we do when we define something: we limit its meaning to something specific. So when you're thinking about the word define, remember that you're looking to create a boundary of meaning around it, whether you're specifying the meaning of a word or a larger concept. To define a word such as astronomy is to define both the word and the realm of science that it's concerned with.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2943,"<ul><li>The noun dread describes the fear of something bad happening, like the dread you feel when walking alone on a deserted street in the dark.</li><li>Dread is a feeling of fear, but it can also be the desire to avoid something. For example, many people feel dread at the very thought of speaking in front of an audience. As a verb, dread means ""to fear or not want something to happen,"" like students who did not study and as a result, dread getting their graded tests back. As an adjective, dread means ""frightening or terrifying,"" like a dread monster.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2944,"<ul><li>The verb expand means to make something bigger or wider. It might refer to something concrete, as when you blow into a balloon and make it expand, or something more abstract, as when you study to expand your mind.</li><li>Expand is a combination of the Latin words ex-, meaning ""out,"" and pandere, ""to spread."" The idea of spreading out was always there, though the current idea of something actually becoming larger was first recorded in the mid-17th century. Expand is a versatile word that can refer to anything getting bigger, from a nation's growing influence in a neighboring country to a waistline that needs a larger belt.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2945,"<ul><li>When asked what the fundamental, or essential, principles of life are, a teenager might reply, ""Breathe. Be a good friend. Eat chocolate. Get gas money.""</li><li>Fundamental has its roots in the Latin word fundamentum, which means ""foundation."" So if something is fundamental, it is a key point or underlying issue — the foundation, if you will — that the thing is built upon.  Teachers argue that math fundamentals include memorizing the times tables and understanding long division. Many people would also argue that math fundamentals should include knowing how to use a calculator and knowing where the calculator's extra batteries are kept.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2946,"<ul><li>Horrifying things are scary and disturbing. A car crash, a violent scene in a movie, and an exposé on what's really in your fast food hamburger can all be described as horrifying.</li><li>Something that scares you to death, like the sound of footsteps upstairs in your dark, empty house or the sight of a bear on the hiking trail, is horrifying. Equally horrifying are things that sicken you, like photographs from a battlefield or the description of a painful dental procedure. Horrifying things inspire horror, originally a Latin word meaning both ""dread"" and ""religious awe,"" from horrere, ""to bristle with fear.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2947,"<ul><li>If you are incredulous that means you can't or won't believe something. If you tell people about those aliens you met the other night, they'll probably give you an incredulous look.</li><li>Incredulous is the opposite of credulous, which means ""believing too easily."" Both words come from the Latin word credere, which means ""to believe.""  Incredulous is stronger than skeptical; if you're incredulous of something, you refuse to believe it, but if you're skeptical, you're doubtful but you haven't ruled it out completely.  If someone insists that your best friend is actually an underworld spy, you'll probably look at them with incredulous anger.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2948,"<ul><li>When someone lingers, he or she takes an unexpectedly long time to depart, as Romeo lingers when bidding Juliet farewell (or as annoying houseguests almost always tend to do).</li><li>In addition to its primary meaning of ""taking a long time to depart,"" linger has the additional meaning of ""persisting while gradually weakening."" In this sense, linger can refer to feelings or sensations that slowly fade away, like the smell of perfume that lingers in an elevator after the passengers have exited.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2949,"<ul><li>An organism is a living thing that can function on its own. That includes your pet guppy, the tree in your backyard, and — of course — you.</li><li>While the word organism typically indicates an actual living thing, you can also use organism to refer to anything that acts or functions like a living thing. For example, the social scene at a high school might be described as ""a social organism"" because it seems to have a mind of its own — like a living thing or even a vicious animal, depending on where one falls on the popularity scale.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2950,"<ul><li>The verb paraphrase means to sum something up or clarify a statement by rephrasing it. So to paraphrase that explanation, it means to say something in other, simpler words.</li><li>If you break paraphrase down, you end up with the prefix para, meaning ""beside,"" and the word phrase — so think of paraphrase as coming up with similar, more simple phrases that go beside the ones already said. You might paraphrase your teacher’s lesson because you want to simplify her complicated technical language, or because you forgot exactly what she said but remember the general meaning.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U28_2951,"<ul><li>When the homeowner described her ant problem as a plague, the exterminator thought she was being a bit melodramatic. After all, a few bugs aren't exactly a huge calamity.</li><li>Centuries ago, if you had admitted to a friend that you had the plague, that friend would have hightailed it in the other direction. In the Middle Ages, the plague was a  horribly contagious illness that spread like wildfire through Europe, killing millions of people. Thanks to the introduction of better hygiene and antibiotics, plague doesn't describe a killer disease as often these days. Instead, it commonly overstates an annoyance, like an apartment dweller claiming his building is plagued by cockroaches.</li></ul>"

If you tell your sister that you'll be at her house presently, you mean that you're on your way.</li><li>You might say that the cookies you just put in the oven will be done presently, or describe how you were so sleepy last night that you opened a book and presently fell asleep, before you could read a single page. Presently also means ""right now,"" as when you say that the temperature outside is presently thirty degrees. This is the older of the two meanings — a fourteenth-century sense of ""at present"" gradually changed to include ""sooner or later.""</li></ul>"

It happens totally by chance, like the random picking of lottery numbers or unplanned random acts of kindness.</li><li>Sometime in the 1980s, teenage slang hijacked the adjective random and tried to turn it into a word meaning weird, odd or out of place. As in ""Dude! That guy wearing purple spandex at the party was so random!""  But don't fall for it. Something that’s truly random is totally governed by chance and has no specific pattern, like choosing a card at random from a magician’s deck.</li></ul>"

You can also call someone's handwriting, if it's hard to read, a scribble.</li><li>Have you ever made a note of something very quickly, and then later when you tried to read it, you couldn't? That's a scribble. People scribble when they need to write fast. The problem with scribbling—-making a scribble-—is that it’s hard to read. Some people have handwriting that is always hard to read: you can call poor handwriting a scribble. Doctors are famous for their scribbles. The Latin root is scribere, ""to write.""</li></ul>"

Think of a shrine as a niche or case in which the spirit of someone special is kept. It could be a statue or some other form of commemoration to either a person or a relic. A shrine can be as small as a tiny mantel in your house or it can be as massive as a building commemorating, or shrining, a sacred person.</li></ul>"

You might crave solitude after spending the holidays with your big, loud family — you want nothing more than to get away from everyone for a little while.</li><li>Solitude can also refer to a place where you're completely alone. The middle of the woods, the top of a big mountain, the middle of a vast desert, even your room — these are places where you might go for solitude. Solitude comes from the Latin word solitudinem, which means ""loneliness,"" but if you have moments of solitude that doesn't necessarily mean you're lonely.

So if the rain that started as a misty drizzle begins to grow torrential, threatening to ruin the picnic you've planned, the weather worsens.

Trucks, vans, buses, and limousines are bigger than the typical automobile, but they’re automobiles, too. A motorcycle isn't an automobile because it only has two wheels.

People are always wondering, ""Who will be the candidates in the next Presidential election?"" Every President, and every office-holder, was once a candidate. When you're a candidate, you raise money, hold rallies, make campaign promises, and do everything you can to win. You can also say someone is a candidate for a job, prize, and other things.

You can enhance the size of something, too, by altering it or raising it, which is what the word original meant (the ""hance"" part came via French from Latin altus, meaning ""high""). When you enhance something you take it to a higher level, like adding salt to French fries to enhance flavor or adding words to enhance your vocabulary.</li></ul>"

First, it is used whenever you talk about dinosaurs to describe the various geologic time periods, for instance the Paleozoic Era, or the Jurassic Era. Second, it is a word beloved of crossword puzzle editors, so if you’re looking for a three-letter word for an age, look no further. Third, it sometimes confuses people who are talking about the ERA, or the Equal Rights Amendment, a vestige of the era of political feminism.</li></ul>"

If you want to stay healthy, you might want to follow the government's dietary guidelines. Sample guideline: go easy on the salt.</li><li>In the 18th century, guideline referred to an actual line that you drew on fabric before cutting.  So for example, if you wanted to cut a piece of linen to make a dress, you'd draw a guideline on it first to make sure the incision would be straight.  The line guided your cut; over time, the word became a metaphor for a guide to any sort of action.</li></ul>"

To interact means to communicate and react to the people you're involved with.</li><li>Some video games are called interactive because they are not static, like board games, but allow players to interact with them and direct the story. If you are talking about chemicals or medicines that interact, the presence of one affects the way the other works. If someone says that you interact well with children, it means you communicate well with them and they respond to you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U29_2970,"<ul><li>A clock breaks time down into intervals of seconds, minutes, and hours. An interval is a distinct measure of time or the physical or temporal distance between two things.</li><li>When you are driving down the highway at 60 mph, you'll see distance markers at intervals of .1 miles. That means that every 1/10th of a mile, you will see one of these markers. Do the math and you'll see that these signs flash by you at intervals of 6 seconds. If your coach tells you to try interval training, he is telling you to do something like run for three minutes, lift weights for two, then run again for three. If he tells you do this again and again, you might want to end this interval of your life.</li></ul>"

If you walk to the end of the block talking on your cell phone, you are a mobile being using a mobile device.</li><li>A mobile is something you hang over a crib to entertain the baby, or a scale model of the universe. In 1940, the word mobile was first used to refer to a house that could be easily moved — a mobile home. If someone says to you jokingly that they ""are not mobile,"" it means that their car is not working.

If you miss your free-throws half the time, your coach will probably try to improve your shooting average by modifying your technique.</li><li>Modify may mean to alter something, but it's not a total makeover. When you modify or make modifications, you're making subtle changes. These tweaks are usually needed to make improvements or make the thing being modified less extreme.

In the 1950s, rock-n-roll was considered a new cultural phenomenon, while today we think of crop circles as a mysterious phenomenon.</li><li>Like many words with Greek roots, phenomenon started out as a science term. Scientists used it (and still do) to describe any event or fact that could be observed, amazing or not. An earthquake, for example, was a phenomenon, because you could see it (and hear it and feel it). Phenomenon is an example of a word having a specific meaning for one group of people that gets changed when used by the general public.</li></ul>"

You might have heard the word pollution — pollution is the stuff that pollutes the environment. The word pollute can be used more figuratively to describe something that corrupts or degrades. For example, reading articles about celebrity weddings can pollute your mind.</li></ul>"

Your bad behavior might bring ridicule on your parents, who raised you to know better.</li><li>The word ridicule is related to ridiculous. If you ridicule a friend, you try to make them look ridiculous. But now that isn't very friendly! Both words come from the Latin redire which means to laugh. When you are ridiculed, you are made a laughing stock, but being the object of ridicule is never funny.</li></ul>"

Then it's probably safe to call it solar.</li><li>The ancient Egyptians worshiped the sun god Ra, shaping their lives around the sun's golden rays and even following a solar calendar. Today sun worship is experiencing a renaissance, as more and more people become interested in harnessing the big star's power for ""solar energy.""

4000EEW_B05_U29_2978,"<ul><li>A certain area that's owned or under the control of someone is called a territory. Countries defend their territories during wars and dogs mark their territory in the yard by peeing on it.</li><li>Although the territory of a country includes its entire area, the noun can also specifically refer to an area governed by a country, but one that isn't a state or province. Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, for example. The noun territory can also be used to describe any assigned region or area, such as a salesman whose territory is the Midwest — that means that he's in charge of business in there.</li></ul>"

These tournaments were composed of a number of fighting events. In the melee event, the knights were divided into two teams which would ride at each other with lances, trying to unhorse the opposing knights. There is evidence that weapons were not blunted for these tournaments. Ouch.</li></ul>"

A piece of paper that someone pushes toward you, right?</li><li>In the legislature, laws draft form are called bills––pieces of paper being passed around. Dollar bills and advertising bills get passed around too. A bird will push the bill of their beak into things too, and the bill of your baseball hat is the part that sticks out in front of the rest of you. When an actor demands top billing, they want to come first on the billboard marquis in front of the theater (and everywhere else).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U30_2982,"<ul><li>If you play a sport you are familiar with the term ""in bounds,"" which refers to the boundary, or limits of the playing field that the players must stay within. It is also the outer limits of any space.</li><li>A boundary is a border and it can be physical, such as a fence between two properties, or abstract, such as a moral boundary that society decides it is wrong to cross.  If you have no sense of boundaries, you probably annoy people sometimes by getting too close to them or talking about inappropriate topics. Gustave Flaubert once said, “Earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is limitless.” A boundary is basically what limits us.</li></ul>"

Putting a dozen dogs and a dozen cats in the same room would probably lead to utter chaos.</li><li>The word chaos derives from a Greek word meaning ""chasm"" or ""void,"" which makes sense, given that chaos also refers to the formless state of matter before the cosmos was created. In math and science, chaos describes a system that will develop in wildly different ways with only tiny changes to the initial conditions. ""Controlled chaos"" is a phrase often used casually to describe something that looks out of control but which functions according to unseen rules or organization.</li></ul>"

But ask a meteorologist and he'll tell you that technically a cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm that forms over a warm ocean, specifically in the South Pacific.

When you learn about a tragedy, like a tsunami that kills many people, it makes you feel terrible for the doomed.</li><li>Doomed is a plural noun for referring to a group of unfortunate people, and it's also an adjective describing someone who's destined to die. A runaway dog that kills the animal control officer's pet chickens is doomed, and many characters in Shakespeare's tragic plays are doomed.

4000EEW_B05_U30_2988,"<ul><li>An adjective referring to the military, the word martial adds a warlike tone to any noun it describes.</li><li>The word martial derives from Mars, the Roman god of war. It refers to almost much anything military, including ""martial law,"" in which the government orders the military to administer the law. The word definitely makes one think of fighting, as in the physical discipline known as the martial arts. But there is a lighter side to the word, too. Martial music, usually associated with the military, is usually bright and inspiring.</li></ul>"

Other birds that fall into the category of poultry are domesticated guinea hens, ducks, and geese. If they're wild, on the other hand, they're called game.

Quarterbacks scramble when they need to escape defenders trying to clobber them. A scramble is not graceful; people scramble when they want to get somewhere fast. Also, scrambling refers to altering a message so others can't read it. Putting a message into code is a type of scrambling. Scrambled messages are like scrambled eggs: all mixed up.</li></ul>"

Sheer can also describe something steep, like a cliff, or anything extreme, like sheer nerve.</li><li>This word has several meanings, but they're all extreme. You might want to layer a sheer shirt over a tank top. Climbing a sheer cliff is almost impossible. If your car sheers, it swerves sharply, and you might crash. Maybe you've met all these meanings in a single nightmare: When the sheer fabric blew over your face as you drove, you lost control and the car began to sheer, filling you with sheer terror as you went over the sheer cliff.</li></ul>"

Figuratively, if you take a stance against bullying, you are standing against it.</li><li>If you take a stance on a contentious issue, it means you believe strongly about it one way or the other.

We've come a long way!</li><li>The telegraph is an outdated form of communication as far as sending long-distance messages goes.  It uses an electric signal broken to create a code that then transmits over a wire and translates into a message. Alexander Graham Bell started tinkering with the telegraph and ended up inventing the first ""harmonic telegraph"" to transmit sound through a wire — which led to the birth of the modern telephone.</li></ul>"

If you're feeling truly miserable, take a deep breath and wail as loudly as possible.</li><li>When it comes to expressing unhappiness, wailing lies at the extreme end of the spectrum. So, it's best to save this response for life's most unpleasant moments — unless you're a jazz musician. In jazz terminology, wailing on one's instrument is actually a good thing. What's the connection between an eardrum-shattering expression of misery and a hot jam session? The answer to that question may depend on your personal musical preferences.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B05_U30_3000,"<ul><li>All of the clothes in your closet make up your wardrobe. If you're tired of your wardrobe,  it just might be time to go shopping.</li><li>From the words warder, meaning “to protect”, and robe, meaning a “piece of clothing,” wardrobe originally meant an entire room where a person's clothing was stored. Nowadays, most people don’t have an entire room for their clothes, so the word wardrobe has downsized to just a large cabinet, or the clothing itself. A wardrobe can also be the costumes (or the costume department) of a theater company or  movie.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3001,"<ul><li>Steer clear of anything adverse. If it's adverse, it's working against you — like adverse weather conditions or the adverse effects of eating too much sugar.</li><li>Coming from the Latin adversus meaning ""turned against,"" adverse is an adjective describing a factor that seems to work against or actively harm something. Think of the related word, adversary, which means ""enemy or opponent,"" so that if something is adverse, it acts as if it were the enemy. If you have an adverse reaction to an antibiotic, your doctor will need to prescribe a new medication.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3002,"<ul><li>On a checkerboard, black squares alternate with white ones. As a verb, alternate means to do something in turns. As a noun, an alternate is a replacement.</li><li>While the noun and verb seem not to mean the same thing, think of it this way: If you are brought on in a game to be someone's alternate, you are there to take their turn. Alternate can also be used as an adjective, meaning different or other. An alternate view of history is one that looks at the past from an uncommon perspective. Pay attention to the pronunciation of alternate: as a verb the end is pronounced ""-nāt"" and as a noun or adjective ""-nət.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3003,"<ul><li>If something is biodegradable, it can decompose naturally. When you're out camping, you shouldn't leave anything behind and certainly nothing that isn't biodegradable.  A plastic bottle is the antithesis of biodegradable — it will be there forever.</li><li>When you think environmentally friendly, you're thinking biodegradable, and truly environmentally friendly substances degrade quickly into harmless components. What makes something biodegradable is that the decomposition is done by means of living organisms, such as bacteria. When you put earthworms into your compost, they're the living organisms that are assisting you with the decomposition.</li></ul>"

Your dad's rude joke might make you gasp and choke on your grilled cheese sandwich.</li><li>You might choke in a smoky room, or choke on a grape that's lodged halfway down your throat. In either case, your body can't get enough oxygen. People also choke up with emotion, figuratively choking on their sobs. Likewise, a child might complain, ""This scarf chokes me!"" — it's uncomfortably tight, but he's not literally unable to breathe. When the weeds in your garden outnumber the vegetables, you can also say they choke, or crowd, your plants.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3006,"<ul><li>If something is convenient, it adds to your comfort, causes little trouble, or is easy to use, do, or reach. If you live close to your job, that's convenient––it's very easy to get there and get home.</li><li>This adjective descends from Middle English, from Latin conveniēns, from convenīre ""to be suitable, fit."" The basic meaning of Latin convenīre is ""to agree, meet, come together,"" and this is the source of English convene. The opposite of convenient is inconvenient, meaning making trouble or annoyance for you. The corresponding nouns are convenience and inconvenience.</li></ul>"

If your closet is overflowing with clothes you haven't worn since 1992, why not discard some of them?</li><li>When the verb discard first entered the English language in the sixteenth century, it referred to card playing and meant “to throw a card away.” Discard is still used to describe getting rid of unlucky cards, but today, you’ll also hear it used in a broader sense — we discard, or throw away, things that are undesirable or no longer useful. You might discard a worn out shoe, for example.</li></ul>"

Scientists aren't sure why they do it, but dolphins are known for leaping above the surface of the water as they swim.</li><li>Dolphins are one of the most commonly recognized and beloved sea creatures, in part because they are gregarious and friendly. Their playful nature and intelligence have brought dolphins into close contact with humans, not always to their benefit. Scientists have learned that dolphins live longer, happier lives when they're not in captivity, so you're less likely to see dolphins at an aquarium than in the past. Dolphins are mammals, giving birth to live babies, which may explain the Greek root of dolphin, delphys, meaning ""womb.""</li></ul>"

Certain cleaning products, for instance, are labeled, “Could be fatal if swallowed.” Here's a helpful suggestion: don't swallow them.</li><li>Can you hear the word fate in fatal? In ancient times, people believed that the future was determined by a force called fate, and in the 14th century, the French used the word fatal to describe anything that fate had decreed, including death.  By the next century the word had evolved to mean something that specifically causes death.  Today the term is used more loosely.  If your friend makes a fatal mistake on the tennis court, it doesn't mean that he'll literally die, just that he'll lose the game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3011,"<ul><li>Incidence means the frequency with which something bad occurs. You’ll hear of “incidences of cancer” or “incidences of war."" You hope the incidence is decreasing, not increasing.</li><li>You might confuse incidence and incident. They sound similar, but incident refers only to something that happened, not to the frequency with which it happens. After a car accident, the police file an incident report, which is a fancy way of saying they write down what happened. Looking at these reports grouped together can show you if the incidence of accidents at specific intersections in town is on the rise.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3012,"<ul><li>A municipality refers to a village, town, or city that's usually governed by a mayor and council. From this noun, we get the adjective municipal, which you can use to describe something that relates to a town or its government.</li><li>Your town's city council may have offices in the municipal building downtown. If you want to fight city hall, that would be the place to go. Municipal also more generally describes anything related to the town or city itself. If you live within the city limits, for example, your house may be hooked into the municipal water supply, but if you live outside the city limits you may have to have your own well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3013,"<ul><li>To overuse something is to use it too much. If you use your cell phone way too often, texting your friends all day long and playing online Scrabble all night, you overuse it.</li><li>You'll drive your English teacher crazy if you overuse the word like, and you'll rack up all kinds of extra fees if you overuse your iPad. Overuse is also a noun (with a slightly different pronunciation, just as the noun use sounds different from the verb use) — extravagant or excessive use is overuse.

You might recycle an old tire and make it into a snazzy black knapsack with some very cool skid marks.</li><li>The prefix re- means again, and when you recycle something, you process it for another cycle of use. The phrase ""reduce, reuse, recycle"" gives you three ways to prevent waste. When you recycle plastic bottles, they’re melted down and made into new bottles or even furniture or clothing. You might do some creative recycling and turn your old textbooks into a coffee table. When you have your washing machine repeat the wash or rinse cycle, that’s a different recycle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3016,"<ul><li>Something is reusable if it can be used more than once. Since you can wash a cloth napkin after you use it, it is reusable. Toilet paper? Not reusable.</li><li>Many cities now encourage shoppers to bring their own reusable bags to stores, instead of having groceries and other goods put in plastic bags that are usually thrown away after a single use. Reusable is a word you'll often see alongside words like recyclable, renewable, or sustainable, in an environmentally conscious context. It comes from the ""again"" prefix re- and usable.</li></ul>"

If a person is stuffed, she's had too much to eat.</li><li>You might sit back after eating an entire pizza and murmur, ""I'm stuffed."" If you're stuffed up, you've got a bad cold and your head is stuffed with mucous. When objects are stuffed, it's usually because they're full of stuffing, like a stuffed armchair or a stuffed animal. It was once common to insult someone who was pompous but ineffectual by calling him a ""stuffed shirt.""</li></ul>"

Tragic.</li><li>Though the word tragic has come to be used for common sorrows, it's best reserved for the kind of sad, unavoidable situations that Shakespeare would have written about. In a staged tragedy, the main character comes to a sad end due to his or her one tragic flaw –– this lead is called a tragic hero.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3019,"<ul><li>To utilize is to use what you have or what's available, and it's a three-syllable word meaning the same thing as the one-syllable ""use.""</li><li>The word utilize is often a more formal way to express ""putting something to use."" If you don’t have time to go to the store but you need to come up with a science project, you might utilize what's already in the kitchen. Most of the time you can use the verb use as a synonym for utilize. You can utilize a shorter word to make a sentence easier to read.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U01_3020,"<ul><li>A whale is a large mammal that lives in the ocean. Whales need to breathe air periodically, and the blowholes on their heads help them do this. Blue whales are the largest animals that ever lived — they're even bigger than the largest dinosaurs were!</li><li>The Old English root of whale means both ""whale"" and ""walrus,"" although these two marine animals are quite different from each other. While some whales grow to be only ten feet long, many whales are enormous. The informal phrase ""a whale of a"" comes from the idea that whales are impressive, and you can use it for things (or people) that really distinguish themselves: ""Wow, this is a whale of a party!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3021,"<ul><li>An amateur is a person who does something for enjoyment, not money, like an amateur who paints as a hobby but earns a living another way.</li><li>The adjective amateur often describes a pastime, like an amateur sports league that people join to get exercise and socialize together. Or it can have a negative meaning and describe something that's poorly done. If your guests leave your dinner table and stop for fast food on the way home, you may be ashamed of your amateur cooking skills. Amateur originated as a French word, meaning ""lover of,"" not ""expert.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3022,"<ul><li>Look to the adjective ambiguous when you need to describe something that's open to more than one interpretation, like the headline ""Squad helps dog bite victim.""</li><li>Newspaper headlines can be unintentionally funny when they're ambiguous. In ""Squad helps dog bite victim,"" is the squad helping a victim of a dog bite or helping a dog bite a victim?  The ambi- prefix means ""both ways,"" while the guous part is from the Latin verb agere, ""to lead or drive."" Thus an ambiguous sentence or situation drives us in two different directions at once. The accent is on the second syllable, ""big,"" which you can remember since something that's ambiguous can lead to big misunderstandings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3023,"<ul><li>If you don't know who wrote a poem, the author is anonymous. If you don't know who donated a gift to a museum, it's called an anonymous gift from an anonymous donor. Anonymous means a person unknown.</li><li>Alcoholics Anonymous takes its name from the fact that it's a confidential group––people use only their first names and do not identify one another as members of the group. Another related meaning of anonymous is to describe something that does not have any special qualities. If you work in an anonymous office building, its design is pretty typical and not very interesting.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3024,"<ul><li>The verb attain is all about reaching some mark of achievement.  You can attain a goal. You can even attain a destination.</li><li>If you consistently have the highest grades in your class, you'll probably attain a reputation for success. Attain derives in part from the Latin tangere, ""to touch,"" which is also at the root of retain, ""to keep,"" obtain, ""to get,"" and contain, ""to control."" One might obtain the discipline to contain one's emotions while studying, thereby attaining control and retaining more information.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3025,"<ul><li>When a group wants to govern itself or a person wants to make independent decisions, they are looking for autonomy.</li><li>Autonomy comes from the Greek roots auto meaning ""self"" and nomos meaning ""custom"" or ""law."" This reflects the political sense of the word — a group's right to self-government or self-rule. When a person seeks autonomy, he or she would like to be able to make decisions independently from an authority figure. Can you relate?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3026,"<ul><li>The noun concession comes in handy in negotiations — between countries, political parties, or even parents and their kids. Want a raise in your allowance? You may have to agree to do more chores as a concession before your parents will agree.</li><li>Although a concession in an argument is the act of yielding or granting something, don't get confused and think that a concession stand is called that because the workers are granting you popcorn at the baseball stadium. Concessions at a ballpark or at another venue are called that because the stadium has granted the right to sell food to a certain provider. Chew on that the next time you're munching on peanuts at a game.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3027,"<ul><li>To decay means to rot, decompose, break down. Our bodies—anything organic—will decay after death. Broken sidewalks, potholes, graffiti are all signs of urban decay. Tooth decay is something to avoid.</li><li>Decay can also mean decline. Anyone, even a great athlete, must exercise regularly to maintain muscle tone—as soon as you stop, the muscles begin to decay. If the strength of the cable signal coming into your house grows weaker over time, you can complain that it has decayed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3028,"<ul><li>To dwell in a home is to live in it. To dwell on something — usually something bad, like a failed romance or terrible service in a restaurant — is to think or speak about it at great length.</li><li>Dwell has been part of the English language for over 1,000 years. The definition of the word has evolved considerably since its first recorded use in the 9th century when Old English dwellan meant ""lead astray"" or ""hinder."" If you constantly dwell on the bad things in life, it could hinder you from seeing the good or lead you astray to the negative. If you keep complaining, your friends might tell you to stop dwelling on it or, if they're really annoyed, they'll say, ""Get over it!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3029,"<ul><li>To enlighten someone means to explain something clearly to him. If your friend is behaving strangely but insists she has a reason for it, you could ask her to enlighten you.</li><li>Enlighten comes from the metaphor that ignorance is a state of being ""in the dark,"" and that knowledge is illuminating. We use enlighten as a verb meaning to clear up, to remove confusion. Light is also a powerful metaphor for spiritual insight. If you have a great revelation about the divinity of the world, you could say you have been enlightened. The era known as the ""Age of Reason"" is also called the Enlightenment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3030,"<ul><li>To enrich something is to make it richer, or to improve the quality of it. You play the lottery because it might enrich your bank account; you play ping-pong to enrich your quality of life.</li><li>Regardless of the sense it is used in, the key to enrich is the word rich (you can almost think of it as the verb form of the adjective). So to enrich something is to make it rich, richer, or just plain better. Enrich always needs an object: You can’t visit a wax museum just to enrich, but you can go to enrich your life. Verbs that enrich include improve, enhance, cultivate, better, and develop.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3031,"<ul><li>A flourish is an extra touch — a trumpet's ""ta-ta-da!"" announcing a king's entrance, a fancy carving atop an otherwise utilitarian pillar, a wave of a flag or a cheerleader's pompom.</li><li>Flourish can also mean ""growth"": ""With the right teacher, a child will flourish."" To understand how the two meanings of flourish connect, remember that the word ""flower"" (spelled flour-) is hiding inside it. Flowers are used for decoration and ornamentation, but they also grow. Get it? Good for you! Imagine a cheerleader shouting out your name, flourishing her pom-poms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3032,"<ul><li>Geometry is the part of mathematics that deals with calculating the distance around a circle, the angles that make up a triangle, or the amount of room inside a cube.  If it involves measuring space, it’s probably geometry.</li><li>The Greek roots of geometry literally mean “to measure earth,” and over 5000 years ago farmers started using geometry to figure out how much land they owned.  You study geometry in school, and you use it all the time, like calculating the best angle to cut a piece of wood for a birdhouse, or when playing a game of pool.  Astronomers use geometry to measure planets millions of miles away—much easier than finding a ruler that big.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3033,"<ul><li>A gleam is a bright flash of light. If you were lost on a dark, stormy night, you'd be hugely relieved to see the gleam of a roadside diner's sign up ahead.</li><li>Use the verb gleam when something is shining as if it were wet or glinting with light. Your new toothpaste might make your teeth so white that they gleam. You can also describe an emotion that appears briefly as a gleam, like a gleam of hope. And as you hatch a plan to toilet-paper the neighbor's yard, mischief might gleam in your eyes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3034,"<ul><li>Greed is an overwhelming urge to have more of something, usually more than you really need. Watching kids at a birthday party furiously grabbing for candy from a piñata, you might find yourself surprised at their greed.</li><li>Greed is often connected with money, a desire to acquire as much of it as possible, but it can refer to that kind of urge toward anything, like food or material possessions. When you see greed, it's an ugly thing, whether you're observing a greedy person or the greed of a huge company that treats its workers badly in order to make more money. Greed comes from the Old English grædig, or ""voracious,"" which means ""always hungry for more.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3035,"<ul><li>Harmony is the sound of things that go together well — people singing in harmony are in tune with each other. Best friends should be in harmony most of the time if they want to stay best buds!</li><li>Harmony is a noun that describes an agreement, such as in feeling, sound, look, feel, or smell. It’s necessary for roommates to be able to live in harmony in a small space, or they’re in for a wake-up call.  In music, harmony is a pleasing combination and progression of chords. If it makes you wince, it’s lacking harmony. Synonyms for harmony include accord, concord, cooperation, like-mindedness, and unanimity. Antonyms, on the other hand, range from clash and disagreement to discord.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3036,"<ul><li>Use indigenous to describe a plant, animal or person that is native or original to an area. Though Switzerland is known for its chocolates, chocolate, which comes from the cocoa plant, is indigenous to South America.</li><li>Indigenous, aboriginal, and native all mean the same thing. Aboriginal, however, is commonly used in connection with Australia, and native with North America. The most neutral of the three terms, indigenous comes from the Latin word, indigena meaning ""a native."" An indigenous ceremony or religion is one traditionally used by a certain group of people.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3037,"<ul><li>Jurisdiction means having a legal right over something. A court can have jurisdiction over a legal question, and a government can have jurisdiction over another country or territory. Even your parents could be said to have jurisdiction over you while you're under 18.</li><li>This noun jurisdiction descends from Latin jūrisdictiō, formed from jūris (from jūs ""law"") plus dictio, ""the act of saying."" Think of it as who has the right to ""say"" what ""the law"" is. In the U.S., certain crimes are tried in state courts, but when a crime involves more than one state, jurisdiction moves to the federal court system, just as the local police step down and the investigation is handled by the FBI.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3038,"<ul><li>A parade is a group of people marching in ceremony, celebration, or protest. Often a parade involves fire trucks, costumed adults throwing candy to children, baton twirlers, and members of the armed forces.</li><li>Parade is also a verb, meaning to walk or march ostentatiously. When your sister first brings home her prom dress, she might parade around the living room after putting it on so everyone can see it. As a noun parade is an event in which a whole lot of people march in the streets — they could be wearing prom dresses, but more likely they're celebrating of a holiday or taking part in a military action.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U02_3039,"<ul><li>To stand as still as a statue is to stand absolutely still, a statue being a sculpture, after all. A statue is a specific kind of sculpture, one that clearly represents a person, an animal, or other living creature.</li><li>There's no question that the first thing most people think of when they hear the word statue is the Statue of Liberty. The woman's name is Liberty and there she is, a statue. Any sculpture that represents a person (Liberty, George Washington, Gandhi, or the Mad Hatter) is called a statue. In New York's Central Park, there is a much beloved statue of a dog named Balto, a heroic husky from Alaska.</li></ul>"

It essentially means “not normal,” or ""unusual.” Abnormal implies that whatever is “not normal” is also undesirable. However, abnormal is sometimes used in a positive context. The phrase “abnormal intelligence,” for instance, usually refers to someone with especially high intelligence.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3042,"<ul><li>Absent means not there. If you absent yourself from class, you're marked as absent. If you have an absent parent, it means they don't live with you or take part in your care.</li><li>Absent can also describe a state of mind, meaning ""not all there"" or ""lost in thought."" If you are absent from class on a test day, you will have to explain your absence, unless your teacher is so absent minded she forgets and just gives you an A.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3043,"<ul><li>Adjacent means close to or near something. You may consider the people up and down your street to be neighbors, but your next-door neighbor is the person who lives in the house or apartment adjacent to yours.</li><li>Adjacent can refer to two things that touch each other or have the same wall or border. And the adjective is often followed by the preposition to: Her office is adjacent to mine. This word is from Latin adjacere ""to lie near,"" from the prefix ad- ""to"" plus jacere ""to lie, throw.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3044,"<ul><li>Aluminum is a relatively light weight type of silver-colored metal. Most soda cans are made out of aluminum.</li><li>There is more aluminum in the earth's crust than any other kind of metal, and because it is so sturdy, pliable, and light, it's used to make all kinds of things. Airplane parts, aluminum foil, metal baseball bats, bicycles, and some power lines are just a few of the everyday objects that are made at least in part from aluminum. The name is based on alumina, or aluminum oxide, with a Latin root of alumen, ""bitter salt.""</li></ul>"

shouldn't they be applicable to everyone?</li><li>Is the idea that there's only one correct way to pronounce a word applicable when it comes to applicable?  There's some disagreement about this among the experts, but you'll hear people pronounce applicable two ways: with emphasis on “app” or with emphasis on “plic.” So take your pick and use this word confidently wherever it's applicable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3046,"<ul><li>From fake flowers to faux food flavors, our world is full of things that are artificial –- that is, produced by humans rather than by nature.</li><li>While artificial can simply mean “made by humans,” it’s often used in a negative sense, conveying the idea that an artificial product is inferior to the real thing. If you remark that your friend’s new hair color looks artificial, for example, you’re not paying her a compliment. Artificial can also describe a behavior or expression that seems insincere — much like the smile on your girlfriend’s face if you bring her artificial flowers instead of real ones.</li></ul>"

They say you never forget how to ride a bicycle once you learn.</li><li>When you travel to places like Amsterdam and Beijing you'll see people of all ages using bicycles as their major form of transportation. The word bicycle is also a verb, as in ""I think I'll bicycle over to the bakery and buy some muffins."" The word bicycle was coined in the 19th century from a combination of the Greek bi, or ""two,"" and kyklos, ""wheel.""</li></ul>"

You may go to a real estate company to get a broker to help you buy a house.</li><li>In Middle English broker meant ""peddler or retailer."" Nowadays a broker still sells things — but she's acting as an agent making deals for someone else and collecting a commission for all that work. Used as a verb, broker means to arrange a deal or negotiate. Working for an advisory firm, a broker may convince you to invest in a company — so the broker would broker a business deal.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3049,"<ul><li>A bureaucracy is an organization made up of many departments and divisions that are administered by lots of people. If you've ever had to deal with health insurance or financial aid, you're familiar with the dark side of bureaucracy.</li><li>Bureaucracy has a bad reputation because it has come to mean an organization or government that is chin-deep in red tape and unnecessary procedures. When dealing with a bureaucracy, expect to fill out lots of forms and wait. Bureaucracies are mocked in the hilarious film ""Brazil,"" where people have mind-numbing jobs they do while sitting at desks.

If you consolidate your childhood toys, you grab them all up and put them in one place. Preferably a toy box.</li><li>Consolidate comes from the Latin roots com- (""together"") and solidare (""to make solid""). So, consolidate is to bring things together to make something solid, stronger, or easier to handle. A general might consolidate his troops, a librarian might consolidate his grammar books, and someone with credit-card debt might consolidate the debt from different cards onto one.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3052,"<ul><li>Even though the real reason you want the newest phone is that it's incredibly cool looking, you might pretend that what interests you is its convenience, or how easy and useful it will be.</li><li>The noun convenience is a quality of ease or accessibility. Just think of a convenience store, which is arranged to be easy to get in and out of, and sells things you might need to grab on your way home. Some things are referred to as a convenience if the whole reason for their existence is to make life easier in some way, like electricity, indoor plumbing, and microwaveable meals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3053,"<ul><li>To deduct is to remove or take away some amount. If your boss deducts money from your paycheck because you're always late to work, she subtracts it.</li><li>When taxes are withheld from your salary, your employer deducts them to pay your contribution. Each time you use a debit card, it deducts the amount you spend from your bank account. A different way to deduct is to come to a reasoned, thoughtful conclusion, or to deduce. The two words were once interchangeable, while now it's more common to use deduct to mean ""remove a portion,"" and deduce to mean ""infer logically.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3054,"<ul><li>To deem is a verb that means to view as or judge. Your parents or boss may deem something necessary that you don't, like coming home by midnight or working late.</li><li>Deem comes from the Old English word, deman — meaning ""act as a judge."" If you deem something, you essentially become the judge of whether it has a characteristic. For example, if you deem your little sister's jokes to be too ridiculous to listen to, you will probably just walk away.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3055,"<ul><li>An entrepreneur is someone who starts a new business. Little stores and huge companies both have entrepreneurs behind them.</li><li>Do you have good ideas for products? Are you OK with the idea of risk? Then maybe you should be an entrepreneur. This is someone who founds a business, whether a tiny one or a huge one. Besides starting the business, the entrepreneur takes on the most of the risk by investing their own money and/or bringing in other investors. For an entrepreneur, their business is their baby.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U03_3057,"<ul><li>The word fiscal resembles the word financial, which makes sense because both involve money.</li><li>This word has to do with anything financial, which is another fancy word for the world of money. When you're an adult, you have fiscal responsibilities like paying rent, buying groceries, and paying taxes. If you put ten percent of your earnings in a savings account, that shows good fiscal sense. Businesses have a lot of fiscal matters to deal with, like paying salaries and trying to make a profit. If you need help with fiscal issues, consult an accountant.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3058,"<ul><li>A franchise is a right granted by a government or corporation to an individual or group of individuals. One of the most important government-issued rights — so important it's known simply as ""the franchise"" — is the right to vote.</li><li>In its more commercial meaning, the fast-food chain McDonalds is a franchise. So are Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken and the New York Yankees. In other words, businesses from which you can buy a license in order to sell or use their products. More recently, the term has come to have an intellectual meaning as well, as in a particular series of books or films, such as the Harry Potter franchise.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3059,"<ul><li>You can use the word ideological to describe shared ideas or beliefs, and the word breaks down to ideo- (not ""idea,"" but close) and -logical. An ideological stand for equal rights made Rosa Parks stay in her seat at the front of the bus.</li><li>Ideological is an adjective that describes political, cultural, or religious beliefs. An ideology is a body of ideas, and those who agree with the main idea of something take an ideological stand to support it. Unlimited freedom is a strong ideological belief in countries like the United States, and communism was once the ideological foundation in parts of Europe. Some follow ideological ideals that are logical, while others take stands that seem, well, idiotic or illogical, like racism.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U03_3060,"<ul><li>A robot is a mechanical creation that can move or act on its own. Science fiction is full of robots.</li><li>Also called droids, Cylons, and bots, robots are certainly the stuff of science fiction stories. But there are plenty of real robots out there in the world, using their mechanical smarts to make life easier. There are robots that can vacuum the rug, dance, perform surgery, clean oil spills, and even build cars. The field of robotics is growing all the time. Maybe someday you'll even have that robot butler so many of us have dreamed about.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3061,"<ul><li>An abbey is a church that's part of a monastery or convent. You'll often find monks or nuns in an abbey.</li><li>There are a few types of abbeys, but they're all related to intense religious dedication. An abbey can be a monastery or convent, which is either composed of monks or nuns who have withdrawn from society to live a life of poverty and chastity. You can also call a church associated with a monastery or convent an abbey. That type of abbey will be run by the monks or nuns but also open to other churchgoers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3062,"<ul><li>On Halloween, you can find candy in abundant supply. Use abundant to describe something that exists in large amounts that are more than what's needed.</li><li>Near synonyms are plentiful, emphasizing ""large amounts,"" and ample, emphasizing ""more than enough."" The adjective abundant is commonly followed by the prepositions with or in, to mean ""filled with or rich in something"": a region abundant in natural resources. Abundant comes from Middle English aboundant, from Old French abondant, from Latin abundāns, form of abundāre ""to overflow.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3063,"<ul><li>Things that adjoin are next to each other or share a boundary. Two adjoining states are neighbors. The United States adjoins Canada.</li><li>Just as the word join suggests togetherness, things that adjoin are together in a specific way. They're adjacent, which means they're butting right up against one other. Two adjoining buildings are connected or next-door neighbors. Two adjoining states share a border. If two rooms adjoin, they are connected by a door or they share a wall. When things adjoin, they have a physical connection.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3064,"<ul><li>Ample describes an abundance of something. An ample supply of apple muffins at the bake sale is a good thing, as is ample legroom in your new van — but if the vet notices your dog's ample waistline, you might have to put Fido on a diet.</li><li>Like amplify (crank up the volume), ample is from the Latin word amplus, meaning ""large or spacious."" Ample can be enough or even too much of something. It's great when there's ample parking or ample snacks for a hike, and we'd all be happy if we had ample time and money. But there are things that some people don't want more of — if your principal has ample evidence that you started the food fight in the cafeteria, you're probably going to end up in detention.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3065,"<ul><li>Arid is so dry that nothing will grow. Death Valley in California features an arid climate, which is why it's called Death Valley and not Life Valley.</li><li>Arid can also mean terribly dull or lifeless. A textbook about the climate of Death Valley might be called arid if it's written in an uninteresting way. Just like you wouldn't want to live in an arid climate, you wouldn't want to sit through an arid performance of the film-turned-musical, ""Some Like it Hot.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3066,"<ul><li>On a trip to Europe, many visitors appreciate the stunning architecture of large churches known as cathedrals.</li><li>The word cathedral comes from a Latin word meaning “seat.” The seat referred to is the seat of the bishop, who is the leader of a group of churches related to the cathedral. The bishop’s seat is both a metaphor for the cathedral as the bishop’s “seat of power” and his actual chair, the ""cathedra,"" inside the cathedral. Originally a cathedral was called a “cathedral church,” with cathedral as an adjective, but it is now a noun.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3067,"<ul><li>A crisis is a difficult or dangerous time in which a solution is needed — and quickly. For example, the crisis caused by a natural disaster might inspire you and your friends to make a donation.</li><li>The noun crisis comes from the Latinized form of the Greek word krisis, meaning ""turning point in a disease."" At such a moment, the person with the disease could get better or worse: it's a critical moment. Think of a celebrity whose recent antics generate headlines like ""Rock Star in Crisis"" — that person needs help that may or may not be sought. At the moment of crisis, things are unstable and maybe even dangerous.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3068,"<ul><li>Deprive means to keep from having. If your little brother gets loud and hyper every time he eats sweets, your parents might deprive him of sugary cereal and candy.</li><li>Deprive can also mean to take away something that someone already had, or feels they deserve to have, like basic human rights. ""A crowd gathered to protest the man's imprisonment for a crime he did not commit; they didn't want to allow the government to deprive him of his freedom."" The word comes from the Latin, de"", which means ""entirely,"" and privare, which means ""release from."" Put together, they mean to ""entirely release from."" In this case, the imprisoned man's freedom is being ""entirely released,"" or taken away, and he'll no longer have it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3069,"<ul><li>When there is a drought somewhere, there's not enough rainfall. In certain areas, a drought can last for weeks, months, sometimes even years! Forget about running your lawn sprinkler during a drought; the water is needed for drinking, bathing, and toilet flushing.</li><li>Another way drought can be used is to refer to a shortage of something (other than rainfall) that lasts for a long period of time, like a drought in job growth during a recession. Typically a drought is not a good thing and something you hope to avoid. For example, if your friend Kenny hasn't gone on a date in five years, it's safe to say that he is having a romantic drought.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3070,"<ul><li>If you get good grades, volunteer at the hospital, play varsity sports, and write for your school paper, you might be eligible for a college scholarship.</li><li>If you’re eligible for something, you’re either qualified for it or allowed to do it. You’re eligible for unemployment benefits if you’ve recently been laid off, but not if you've never had a job in the first place. You may not be eligible to enter a sweepstakes if you work for the company giving away the money. Neither your dog nor your friend from Australia is eligible to run for president of the United States, but you might be!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3071,"<ul><li>When you see fast, you might think of Olympic runner Usain ""Lightning"" Bolt or a Porsche 911 Turbo. Alternatively, and quite confusingly, fast also means to refrain from eating for a certain period, usually for religious reasons.</li><li>Fast is another of those deceptively simple words that have a number of other meanings beyond their most common usages. If something ""sticks fast"" it means it cannot be removed — like a leech or a stain. ""To stand fast"" means not to give up your point of view or to remain loyal. Then there's also the slang meaning of living beyond the constraints of normal behavior — as in ""the fast life,"" ""the fast track,"" or ""the fast lane.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3072,"<ul><li>When you grumble, you complain about something clearly but quietly, in a low mutter. Some people grumble a hundred times a day, about everything from the weather to the traffic to their bad luck at bowling.</li><li>The verb grumble is a great example of onomatopoeia, a word that sounds just like what it means. When you say ""grumble"" out loud, you're practically already grumbling about something. The origin of grumble is the Middle French word grommeler, or ""mutter through the teeth."" Just think about the things in life that make you want to mutter through your teeth and you'll probably start to grumble.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3073,"<ul><li>Inland means far away from the ocean, or in the very middle of a country. If you were born and grew up in Kansas, you're familiar with inland living.</li><li>The opposite of inland is coastal. When you travel to the rocky coast of Maine or the soft sandy beaches of Florida, you're far from being inland — you return to your inland home town when you fly back to Gary, Indiana. Inland comes from the Old English inn lond, ""land around the mansion of an estate,"" and it began to mean ""land far from the coast"" in the 16th century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3074,"<ul><li>Moisture is the feeling of wetness — what you want in your cupcake but not in your diapers.</li><li>Moisture is the noun related to the adjective moist, which you might use to describe damp soil, clammy air, or melt-in-your-mouth desserts. Moisture has also been known to promote mold growth and frizz otherwise tame hair, so it doesn't have many fans — other than tropical plants and the very thirsty.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3075,"<ul><li>This is a word that people don't usually stop and define. They use it to link two seemingly contradictory thoughts. Nonetheless, it does have a definition. It means ""in spite of.""</li><li>Break this word up to examine its meaning: None-the-less means that the statement you've just made does not diminish or make less what comes next. We are not at all prepared to climb this mountain, nonetheless we are going to try.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3076,"<ul><li>An oath is a promise. If you want to borrow your brother's car, you may have to swear a solemn oath that you will bring it back unharmed.</li><li>An oath is a solemn promise, sometimes made in front of a witness, or a vow in a court of law that you will tell the absolute truth. No matter what the circumstances are, swearing an oath is serious business. That's why it's odd that an oath can also be an angry outburst of obscene words. Your brother might mutter an oath under his breath and clench his fists angrily if you return his car to him with a broken side mirror.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3077,"<ul><li>A prairie is a plain of grassy land without many trees. If you're raising cattle, find some prairie land to let them roam around on.</li><li>Prairie means grassland, and comes from the French word for ""meadow."" While we might describe a single meadow, we usually use prairie to describe a type of countryside. In the United States, the natural state of the land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains is prairie, which is why there's so much farming there.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3078,"<ul><li>Terrain that is broken and uneven is called rugged. If you want an easy hike, you should stay away from the rugged coastline. That rocky shoreline is definitely for the more experienced hikers.</li><li>The same sense of unevenness applies to other things that are described as rugged. If someone tells a man that he has a rugged face, it's meant to compliment his rough, strong looks. Rugged can also describe something that is steady, sturdy, and strong. Only your rugged constitution will keep you alive in that period of famine between your after school snack and dinner.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3079,"<ul><li>If something is scarce, there isn't much of it around. Crops are scarce after a long drought, or you might find babysitters scarce if your kids are a nightmare to watch.</li><li>Scarce, meaning “restricted in quantity,” can oddly be traced back to the same Latin word that spawned the word ""excerpt."" Use the word scarce when you want to say that something is hard to find or practically missing. When you know you’re about to be asked to do something unpleasant, like wash the dishes or take out the trash, go ahead and “make yourself scarce,” which means to be elusive or get out of there fast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U04_3080,"<ul><li>When you speculate, you use what you know to make a prediction about an outcome, like when you speculate that the injury of two key players will prevent your favorite team from going far in the playoffs this year.</li><li>The verb speculate has a specialized meaning in the world of finance — it means to take a financial risk in the hopes of monetary gain. For example, a business owner may speculate that a brand-new kind of frozen yogurt will be really popular, so she buys a huge order of it for her ice cream store. Someone who speculates goes looking for the next big thing, as seen in the word's Latin origin, speculatus, meaning ""to spy out, examine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3081,"<ul><li>If it has to do with water, it's aquatic. If you prefer your volleyball net in a pool, it sounds like you're into aquatic sports.</li><li>The word aquatic comes from the Latin word aqua, which means water. The adjective also describes something that takes place in water. If you are on a swimming or diving team, you can say you are into aquatic sports, which may take place at an aquatic center. If you visit an aquatic garden, you'll see plants that thrive in water like water lilies and lotus flowers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3082,"<ul><li>A biosphere is a place where organisms live. You wouldn't want to travel beyond the earth's biosphere, unless of course you are an astronaut.</li><li>From the Greek bios, ""life,"" and sphaira, ""sphere,"" biosphere came into English use in the 19th century. It means the life that occurs within a certain sphere or region around a planet. If you're reading this from Mars you probably have a biosphere all your own. You and other living things on Earth need oxygen and other substances to survive, and the biosphere fulfills those needs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3083,"<ul><li>Someone or something bizarre is odd or unusual in appearance, style, or character. If your teacher walks into class wearing a purple boa, lime-green cowboy boots, and a scuba mask, you might comment, ""How bizarre!""</li><li>Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected elements. Bizarre was borrowed from French, from bizarro ""angry, fierce, strange,"" from Spanish, ""bold, like a knight."" The Spanish word was probably influenced by Basque bizar ""a beard,"" since beards were taken as signs of energy and spirit. Nowadays it takes more than a beard to get you labeled as bizarre. Unpredictable behavior is often called bizarre — like when your little brother decides that he will communicate only in Pig Latin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3084,"<ul><li>A unit for measuring temperature that goes from zero to one hundred is known as Celsius. Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius.</li><li>In the U.S., it's standard to use Fahrenheit to measure temperature, while Celsius is the preferred scale in most of the rest of the world. If 34 degrees feels quite chilly to you, you're thinking in Fahrenheit; 34 degrees Celsius is the temperature of a summer day in the desert! Celsius, originally known as centigrade, was named after the Swedish astronomer who invented the Celsius scale in 1742.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3085,"<ul><li>Coarse can mean rough to the touch or vulgar. It's good to have coarse sand paper, but not good to have coarse manners.</li><li>Do you lick your dinner plate, wipe your nose on your sleeve, and generally behave like an oaf? No, of course not. You're the kind of person who reads online dictionaries. But if you did do any of things, you'd be coarse — that is, unrefined, boorish, and downright vulgar. Coarse can apply to a wide variety of things other than behavior. If something is of poor quality, cheap and inferior, it's considered coarse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3086,"<ul><li>A companion is one who serves as a friend or partner in something. Whether it’s travel or dinner or card-playing, your companion is the one who does it with you.</li><li>The word companion is a close, um, companion to the word company, and you might as well say that someone you keep company with is your companion. Sometimes, it describes a piece of art or other work that goes with another. For instance, you might read a biography of Emily Dickenson as a companion to her studying her poems. The things go together and complement each other.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3087,"<ul><li>When your stomach breaks down food, it digests it.  To digest is to process food so it can be absorbed into the body or information so the mind can absorb it.</li><li>If you tell your mother some bad news, like say, that you failed your math test after studying so hard, she might say, ""Let me take a moment to digest that information."" She's not going to swallow the paper and let her stomach do the work. Instead, she's going to take a moment to sit with the news and understand it. As a noun, a digest is a magazine that breaks down information into understandable summaries.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3088,"<ul><li>Duration is how long something lasts, from beginning to end. A duration might be long, such as the duration of a lecture series, or short, as the duration of a party.</li><li>The noun duration has come to mean the length of time one thing takes to be completed. The duration of something might be known or not — in past times, the unknown length of time the current war would last was called ""the duration. ""Musical notes, such as whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes, have different set durations, or lengths of time for which they are held. These varying durations, when put together, create the rhythm of the music.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3089,"<ul><li>The noun ecology describes the environment as it connects to living things, or the branch of biology that studies that environment.</li><li>The German zoologist Ernst Haeckel coined the word ecology almost 150 years ago, and it should come as no surprise — his being a serious scientist and all — that he combined a couple of Greek words to do it. Oikos means ""habitation"" and -ology means ""the study of."" So ecology started off as the study of where things live. More and more, though, the word is used interchangeably with environment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3090,"<ul><li>A feat is an exemplary, even bold achievement, often an act of great courage or skill.  Getting your cat to wear a leash was quite a feat.</li><li>The noun feat developed from the Latin facere, meaning ""make do.""  Today, it gets applied to a deed that's noble or out of the ordinary.  Have you ever accomplished amazing feats in your dreams, like flying?  If so, I hope you didn't wake up on the roof.  Maybe you perform feats of daring in your everyday life, if you're a firefighter or a tightrope walker.  If you're afraid of heights, just taking the glass elevator counts as a courageous feat!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3091,"<ul><li>Infinite describes things that are endless, like the universe, or your uncle's corny jokes.</li><li>Finite means ""relating to something with an end,"" and when you add the prefix in-, meaning ""not,"" you get infinite: having to do with something that never, ever ends. If someone has read every single book about pyramids, you might say he has an infinite knowledge of ancient Egyptian culture, even though that's an exaggeration. Surely he'll stop talking about them at some point...right?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3092,"<ul><li>A nucleus is often called the brain, or control center, of a eukaryotic cell (that is, a cell with a nucleus).</li><li>The noun nucleus has several senses, though most of them will appear in science. If a biology teacher says nucleus, she is probably talking about a cell (or a group of cells), but a physics teacher would be talking about the center of an atom, or possibly even the center of a comet’s head. Step out of science class, and nucleus likely refers to a core group — like the math fanatics that math club could not function without.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3093,"<ul><li>A creature that lives off another organism is a parasite. The parasite might not hurt the host, but it doesn't do anything to help it, either.</li><li>If you call someone a parasite, you are really hurling an insult! The Ancient Greeks used the word parasitos to describe someone who ate at your table but never invited you back. Some telling synonyms include leech,"" toady, sponge, and hanger-on."" Nice, huh? Some crafty birds, such as the cowbird or cuckoo, are called social parasites, laying their eggs in other birds' nests and expecting those mamas to raise their young for them. Unfortunately, there are some people like that, too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3094,"<ul><li>If you're looking for an adjective that means ""sticking out above the rest; famous,"" consider prominent. A prominent person might be the big star, the head honcho, the top dog — not just any ordinary person.</li><li>A prominence is anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain ridge. Prominent, then, means ""sticking out"" either in a literal sense (""a prominent nose"") or a figurative one (""a prominent figure in the industry""). The metaphorical sense of ""famous"" is the most common one today, so you're more likely to hear about prominent people than prominent noses.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3095,"<ul><li>Something that is repetitive involves doing the same thing over and over again. If you get bored running on a treadmill daily, you might try something less repetitive, like playing soccer outdoors.</li><li>Anything you do repeatedly, especially when it's boring, can be described using the adjective repetitive. Jobs like loading and unloading a dishwasher, filing papers, and cleaning a bathroom can all feel repetitive when you have to do them regularly. A story your dad tells every time you have guests for dinner is repetitive, and a droning song that repeats the same chorus again and again is repetitive too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3096,"<ul><li>Anything reproductive has to do with creating babies or other new life. If you get a pair of pet rabbits but soon have twenty, then you know those bunnies are in good reproductive health. Congratulations.</li><li>When animals have babies, they reproduce. Anything related to reproduction can be described as reproductive. There is sexual and asexual reproduction — dandelions that pop up all over the yard are being reproductive all by themselves. Scientists who study reproductive habits of animals analyze how they bear offspring. Fertility doctors help people who are having reproductive problems. When people fight for reproductive rights, they want the freedom to decide when and how they have babies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3097,"<ul><li>Temperate means mild, moderate. If you're a temperate person, you are calm, reasonable. If you live in a temperate climate, it's warm and sunny, but not too hot.</li><li>Like other words that sound similar, temperate has to do with measurement and range. Temperatures measure how hot and cold things are and someone with a temper is hot-headed or intemperate, the opposite of this word. A temperate person's life motto is summed up by Goldilocks: not too hot and not too cold, just right.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3098,"<ul><li>When you practice tolerance, you accept another's ideas and beliefs.  If you respect someone's opinions — even if you disagree or find them nonsensical — you display tolerance.</li><li>The noun tolerance, which stems from the Latin for ""endurance,"" also refers to an organism's ability to stand or handle a difficult environmental condition.  If you build up a tolerance, you can handle large amounts of something (from medicine to psychological abuse) without being too strongly affected.  We usually use the word to refer to our need to accept others, as suggested by John F. Kennedy when he said, “Tolerance implies no lack of commitment to one's own beliefs. Rather it condemns the oppression or persecution of others.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3099,"<ul><li>Undergo means ""endure until something is complete."" You might undergo testing to check your hearing or undergo special training if you want to volunteer at a homeless shelter.</li><li>The verb undergo means ""experience"" or ""undertake."" It is often used to describe medical procedures, such as, an injured quarterback who will undergo shoulder surgery. The word implies that it is something that has to happen so that a positive change occurs, like healing in the case of the quarterback or greater communication skills for a hot-tempered person who undergoes anger management training.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U05_3100,"<ul><li>Use the adjective vulnerable to describe something or someone open to being physically or emotionally wounded, like a newborn chick or an overly sensitive teenager.</li><li>Vulnerable is from Latin and is based on vulnus, ""wound."" From its literal meaning, it has come to be more often used for someone who is easily hurt or likely to succumb to temptation. It's best used for a person whose feelings are so delicate that they can't withstand any criticism or pressure: ""Don't speak harshly to her, she's very vulnerable today.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3101,"<ul><li>If you use the adjective archaic you are referring to something outmoded, belonging to an earlier period. Rotary phones and cassette players already seem so archaic!</li><li>The adjective archaic means something that belongs to an earlier or antiquated time. It can also mean something that is outdated but can still be found in the present and therefore could seem out of place. The word comes from archaic (i.e., ancient) Greek, archaikos, and literally means ""from Classical Greek culture,"" though its meaning has broadened as it's been used in English.</li></ul>"

You'll see brass everywhere once you start looking: in doorknobs, lamps and light fixtures, zippers, and tools.</li><li>Because brass is both workable and strong, it's used in musical instruments (in fact, there's a whole category of instruments known as brass, including saxophones and trumpets). It's also a low-friction metal, so it's preferred for ammunition casings, gears, and locks. And brass is shiny and cheerful, so people like to use it in light fittings, plaques, and sculptures. High-ranking military members are informally known as brass, inspired by the insignia on their uniforms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3103,"<ul><li>Capitalism is an economic system featuring the private ownership of business wealth and the free and unfettered operation of trade markets.</li><li>Capital is usually understood to be money that is put into a business, accumulated by a business, or used in some way to produce more money. In a capitalist economy, the capital is owned by private individuals, as opposed to the government or state (as in socialism or communism). Another important aspect of capitalism is the ""free market,"" where in theory natural competition always leads to innovation and price controls.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3104,"<ul><li>It's the Ikea curse: You spend four hours figuring out how to piece together your new furniture, only to be left with one random component, or part, that doesn't seem to fit anywhere.</li><li>It's not surprising that component is related to a Latin word that means ""to put together."" You simply can't put something together without all of the correct components. Technically speaking, a component is an element of a system or a part of a machine. But a component can also be a factor or ingredient, such as the components of a decision or the components of a really good chocolate cake.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3105,"<ul><li>Dependence is a state where someone is heavily reliant on someone or something else. This could mean the dependence of children on parents or an addict on a drug.</li><li>Since to depend on someone is to need them, dependence is a state or condition of strong need. There are many kinds of dependence: a dog is in a state of dependence with his master. This word is also often used for drug and alcohol dependence, which is known as addiction. Dependence a strong word for extreme needs: liking something, like chocolate, isn't really dependence. The opposite of dependence is independence: being self-reliant and not needing others.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3106,"<ul><li>Diminish means to make smaller or lesser. If you cover a lightbulb with a dark lamp shade, the light from the lamp will diminish.</li><li>It can also mean become less important. Once the light has been dimmed, its role in lighting the room is diminished. If you look at diminish, you see 'minis' which comes from the Latin word minus, as in subtraction. Other words that share this root are miniature and minuscule, all of which mean something that is small, or at least smallish.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3107,"<ul><li>A drawback is a disadvantage or slight problem. Some drawbacks to adopting a puppy can include lost sleep, having your sneakers gnawed on, and spending too much money at the vet.</li><li>When something is mainly positive but not perfect, those imperfections are drawbacks. You might love your new job working at the library on weekends, despite the drawback of needing to get up early on Saturday mornings. And even though the drawbacks to getting that adorable puppy are very real, you'll probably be glad you did it. This noun, which was coined in the 18th century, comes from the sense of drawing (or holding) back success.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3108,"<ul><li>To impose means to force or inflict something on someone else. If you want to impose your musical taste on your parents, play your tunes all day at top volume.</li><li>The verb impose emerged in the 1580s, meaning ""to lay on as a burden,"" which is very similar to the modern meaning. Governments often impose taxes, legal restrictions, and other burdensome things on citizens, for example. But you should remember what Confucius once wisely said: ""Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3109,"<ul><li>An industry is a group of manufacturers or businesses that produce a particular kind of goods or services. Workers in the textile industry design, fabricate, and sell cloth. The tourist industry includes all the commercial aspects of tourism.</li><li>You can use industry to refer to a group of similar businesses: The automobile industry makes cars and car parts. The food service industry prepares food and delivers it to hotels, schools, and other big facilities. Industry comes from the Latin industria, which means ""diligence, hard work,"" and the word is still used with that meaning. If you build a house in three weeks, when the same job takes everyone else three months, you're showing impressive industry.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U06_3111,"<ul><li>Use the adjective medieval to describe something from the Middle Ages, or something so backwards that it might as well be from the Middle Ages. A teacher once rapped your knuckles with a ruler as punishment? That’s practically medieval!</li><li>Medieval can also have positive connotations, since the Middle Ages are remembered as a time of knights and courtly love, when chivalry and honor were highly valued. If a guy doesn’t mind getting his feet wet lifting his girlfriend over a big puddle, that’s medieval in a nice way. However, if he then dies of the bubonic plague, that’s medieval in a less nice way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3112,"<ul><li>Use the adjective obsolete for something that is out of date. As the Rolling Stones song ""Out of Time"" goes, ""You're obsolete, my baby, my poor old-fashioned baby.""</li><li>Obsolete is from the Latin obsolescere ""to fall into disuse,"" and it is a very handy adjective for anything that is no longer used, from words to factories to computer software to ways of thinking. Something that is obsolete has usually been displaced by a newer, shinier innovation. Compact discs made records and cassettes obsolete, and then downloadable digital music files made compact discs obsolete.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3113,"<ul><li>To be oriented is to be positioned in a direction relative to something or someplace else, and it's often used with the prepositions ""toward"" or ""away from."" In order to find our way home, we should be oriented toward the north.</li><li>You can be oriented towards or away from all sorts of things, not only geographic ones. For example, if you like sports, you might be called sports-oriented. If politics is your thing, then you're politically oriented.

For millennia, people have used the North Star to orient themselves, because it's always in the same place in the sky.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3114,"<ul><li>Part of Italy is a peninsula, and it's a pretty famous one, because it looks like a boot. A peninsula juts into the water but has at least a narrow a connection to land. If the boot broke off from Italy just below the ""knee,"" it would be an island.</li><li>The word peninsula, which entered English in the 16th century, comes from the Latin words paene, ""almost,"" and insula, ""island."" Some confuse an island with a peninsula because both are surrounded by so much water, but a peninsula is connected to a mainland at some point, while an island is completely encircled by water. In most cases, a peninsula is narrow and long, resembling an arm or leg.</li></ul>"

To remember this word think about pres- — people or things with prestige often are covered by the press.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3116,"<ul><li>Proportion is about balance and how things fit together harmoniously. For example ""That hound dog's tiny legs look out of proportion to that big fat body.""</li><li>The prefix comes from the Latin pro meaning ""on behalf of, for."" If you're Proportion likes portions, and for them to be the right size. The cake's sweetness is in direct proportion to how much sugar you put in. It's a compliment to tell someone he or she has just the right proportions, but you might get slapped.

4000EEW_B06_U06_3117,"<ul><li>If something is considered extremist or very different from anything that has come before it, call it radical.</li><li>The noun, radical, comes from the Latin radix ""root,"" and in fact, radical and root are synonymous as technical terms in fields such as math and linguistics. In more everyday language, a radical is someone who has very extreme views, so you could say that their views are different from the root up. Similarly, a radical flaw or change is a fundamental one whereas a radical design or idea is very new and innovative.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3118,"<ul><li>The verb refute is to prove that something is wrong. When the kids you're babysitting swear they brushed their teeth, you can refute their claim by presenting the dry toothbrushes.</li><li>Evidence and arguments are used to refute something. So are facts. For example, if children who eat chocolate before going to bed go straight to sleep, that refutes the idea that sugar keeps them up. Refute comes from the Latin refutare for ""to check, suppress."" A near synonym is confute, but save refute as an everyday word for proving something is false.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3119,"<ul><li>Spectacular is both a noun and an adjective. The noun spectacular refers to a big, beautiful production, like a play or musical performance that has a huge cast and many dance numbers.</li><li>As an adjective, spectacular has the same quality of being over-the-top, like a spectacular restaurant with excellent food, celebrities at all the table and a gigantic waterfall along one wall. If something is spectacular, it seems like a rare feat, a real stop-and-stare moment. That's why it can also be associated with drama, or making a spectacle or scene, like a spectacular argument you witness out on the street.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U06_3120,"<ul><li>Weaving involves lacing strips of fabric, string, or some other material together to make something. You can weave wool to make a rug, or weave the details of a story together to make a great book.</li><li>While weave originally only meant to make cloth by interlacing material, it later came to also mean more generally “combine into a whole.” Think of a spider and how it weaves its web, or of how some songs expertly weave in unexpected elements, like the sound of a siren or the waves crashing. You can also use weave to describe a swaying motion, like that of a car darting through traffic when it’s trying to move ahead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3121,"<ul><li>An accountant is a person whose job involves keeping financial records for a business. To be a great accountant, you've got to be good at math.</li><li>When a company hires an accountant, it turns over the management of its accounts to that person, who is responsible for keeping track of spending, income, and any other financial information. An accountant is also held accountable for the accuracy of a company's books, and usually has to be officially certified before working in the field. The word comes from account, by way of the Old French aconter, ""to count.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3122,"<ul><li>Someone who hopes to profit by investing money or financing business ventures is a  capitalist.  A nation's economy is described as capitalist if it's based on private ownership and profit.</li><li>The word capitalist appeared in 1791, taken from the French word capitaliste. A capitalist is someone who believes in the economic philosophy of Capitalism, a system of privately-owned, for-profit businesses.  A capitalist might believe in free enterprise and the individual’s ability to gain wealth through intelligence and hard work.  Capitalist can also be used to describe a self-interested, every-man-for-himself approach to the world.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3123,"<ul><li>Reserve the noun contempt for an extreme lack of respect: a food snob has nothing but contempt for mass-produced burgers and fries at a fast-food joint.</li><li>Contempt has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere ""to despise,"" and if you despise someone, you have contempt for them. It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than either disdain or scorn.  It suggests you find someone or something utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words ""Big Mac"" or ""Whopper"" with a voice dripping in contempt.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3124,"<ul><li>A crop is a large amount of one kind of fruit or vegetable that's grown on a farm. Your farmer uncle's corn crop might be especially large after a summer with plenty of rain.</li><li>A major crop in parts of Asia is rice, while the coffee bean crop is important to the economics of several African and South American countries. A different kind of crop is the short whip that some riders use on horses — and when you crop something, you cut it short. You might decide to crop your hair at the beginning of the summer each year. The noun came first, originally defined as ""the top of a sprout or herb.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3125,"<ul><li>To dedicate is to assign, to commit or to give over. If you dedicate a song you’ve written to a friend, it means the song belongs to them. If you dedicate yourself to a project, it means you give yourself to it.</li><li>Things you may be dedicated to include your family, improving your local park, or attempting to break the world record for making the world's biggest rubber band ball. A dedicated resource is one committed to a specific mission, such as the computer room at your school being dedicated, or given over, to newspaper production every Tuesday afternoon.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3126,"<ul><li>A ditch is a long trench or pit dug into the ground. If your lawns are always soggy, build a drainage ditch for the excess water to flow into.</li><li>A ditch can be a man-made trench, usually long and narrow, dug into the earth, or a natural ditch made by flowing water. Originally used for farming, we now use ditch for any pit in the ground. Ditch can also be a verb meaning to toss something or forsake it. You can ditch a plan that's going wrong, or a boyfriend who is misbehaving. If you make an emergency crash landing, you ditch your plane.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3127,"<ul><li>Enterprise describes a readiness to act boldly to get something started, like the enterprise it takes to start a charity with only a dream and a few dollars.</li><li>Another meaning of enterprise is ""a business venture,"" like a frozen yogurt enterprise. It requires a lot of determination, hard work and the steady belief that people will love your yogurt. People will say you show extraordinary enterprise for your willingness to take on such a challenging project, meaning you have initiative and drive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3128,"<ul><li>To finance something is to pay for it, like using the money you earn at your part-time job to finance your cell phone bill.</li><li>As a verb, it carries two very different meanings: ""to pay for"" or ""obtain on credit."" So, if you can finance your trip, it means you have the money to pay for it. Anyone who works in finance, meaning the banking and investment industry, will tell you plenty of people get in trouble by letting credit cards finance things like vacations.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3129,"<ul><li>If you're indifferent about something, you don't care much about it one way or another. You might feel indifferent about politics, changing the channel whenever the TV news comes on.</li><li>People seem indifferent when they're obviously unconcerned — an indifferent observer of a tennis match is clearly not rooting for either player, and an indifferent voter might choose a candidate at the last minute by flipping a coin. A slightly less common meaning of indifferent is ""unbiased or impartial,"" which you can see in its root, the Old French indifferent, or ""impartial."" In this sense of the word, we all hope our laws and legal system are indifferent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3130,"<ul><li>To irrigate is to supply with water, usually with ditches and channels that allow the water to flow.</li><li>Irrigating is a type of watering that is important in one field in particular: farming. If a farmer has a huge number of crops, you can see how getting water to them could be difficult. The farmer irrigates by digging little channels that allow hard-to-reach spots to receive water. If there is a drought, irrigating will have to happen often to save the crops. People with large gardens might need to irrigate as well. Irrigating waters plants, keeping them alive.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3131,"<ul><li>When you maximize something, you make it as big as you possibly can, the way you would maximize your chances of winning the lottery if you spent all of your money on lottery tickets.</li><li>It seems like you come across the word maximize most often in dry, boring contexts like businesses trying to ""maximize"" their profits or a politician wanting to ""maximize"" her government's potential. Regular people probably use it more often when they're talking about their computers, to mean ""display a window at its largest size."" When you maximize a window on your computer, you can actually see what the word means!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3132,"<ul><li>If it has to do with money or currency, it’s monetary, like your childhood toy collection that has no monetary value, but you love it nonetheless.</li><li>The adjective monetary is related to a Latin word that means “mint,” which is not just a refreshing gum or ice cream flavor but, in this case, where money is made. Anything that pertains to money can be described as monetary, like a country whose monetary system consists of metal coins of different denominations or an antiques expert who can tell you the monetary value of the old things in our attic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3133,"<ul><li>A precaution is a careful action you make in advance. You might want to take the precaution of bringing lots of water and sunblock if you're going on a desert hike.</li><li>Precaution means exactly what it sounds like. The prefix pre- means before, and caution means carefulness in the face of danger. People use glasses when they're on a computer as a precaution because there are links to long hours on a computer and vision damage. A fire drill is a precaution so that you know what to do in case of a real fire. Someone who is always careful exhibits precaution.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3134,"<ul><li>Preliminary means something that comes before something else. If you want to run in the race, you have to place in the top third of the preliminary round. It can also mean ""early"" — the preliminary results are in, and you've won!</li><li>Preliminary is often used euphemistically, as in, ""There are a few preliminaries we'll need to take care of before you start your new job. First, sign over all your worldly goods to the company, then write a letter to your family explaining that you will never see them again. All set?""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3135,"<ul><li>The verb saturate means to cause something to be fully soaked to the point where it can't take on anything else. A heavy rainstorm can saturate the ground, leaving puddles on the lawn because no more water can be absorbed.</li><li>The word saturate comes from the Latin word saturatus, meaning ""to fill full, sate, drench."" Saturate is often used to describe the aftermath of a big rainstorm, but other things can be saturated as well. If you're a workaholic, you might saturate all your free time with work, leaving no time to spend with your family. In chemistry, saturate describes causing one substance, like a solution, to take on the greatest amount of another substance.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3136,"<ul><li>Simplicity is a noun that means ""the quality of being plain."" The simplicity of your prom dress made you stand out in the sea of ruffles and sequins.</li><li>Simplicity describes a lack of ornamentation, like a Christmas tree that is only decorated with white lights instead of being fancied up with lots of ornaments, tinsel and multi-colored bulbs. The noun simplicity also means ""freedom from hardship or effort"" like the simplicity of hanging out on your porch. Simplicity also describes something easy to accomplish or understand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3137,"<ul><li>When you plant seeds in the ground, you sow them. You can also sow things like doubts or ideas, simply by spreading them around. If your ideas (or your seeds) develop and grow, you've successfully sown them.</li><li>The verb sow is pronounced completely differently from the noun sow, which means ""a female pig."" When you sow flower seeds, it rhymes with ""go."" When you admire an enormous, muddy sow in a pig pen, it rhymes with ""cow."" When two words are spelled the same but sound different, they're called heteronyms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3138,"<ul><li>If you're a gardener, you know that a spade is a small shovel with a short handle. A spade is perfect for planting bulbs and digging up weeds.</li><li>In addition to a small digging tool, a spade is also a suit of playing card — the black one that looks a bit like an upside-down heart. There's even a card game called ""Spades"" in which a spade has a higher value than any other suit. The two meanings have different roots; the card suit spade comes from the Greek spathe, and the little shovel kind of spade has Proto-Germanic roots that mean ""flat piece of wood.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3139,"<ul><li>Although usually called a vegetable and eaten as such, the tomato is actually a fruit that can be eaten raw or cooked. It might be red or yellow in various sizes, and comes in shapes from round to pear-shaped.</li><li>Since the tomato is native to South America, it makes sense that its name is based in the Spanish tomate, and can be traced to the Aztecs, whose language, Nahuatl, contained the word tomatl, or ""the swelling fruit."" In 1519, Cortez brought tomato seeds to Spain, where the plant was grown as an ornament but not for eating. The French called them pommes d'amour, or “love apples,” and in 1929 the word became American slang for a pretty girl.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U07_3140,"<ul><li>Upcoming means happening soon. If you've always wanted a surprise party, you might drop hints to your friends about your upcoming birthday.</li><li>The adjective upcoming was first used in the 19th century to mean ""rising,"" but its meaning changed to ""forthcoming"" or ""imminent"" by the mid-20th century. If you'll vote next month, you might talk about the upcoming election, and your little sister might be excited about your upcoming family trip to Disney World. Whenever you find yourself thinking of an event that's coming up, it's upcoming!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3141,"<ul><li>Anthropology is the scientific study of the origins of humans, how we have changed over the years, and how we relate to each other, both within our own culture and with people from other cultures.</li><li>Anthrōpos is the Greek word for “human being,” and the suffix -logy means “the study of.”  The study of human beings, that’s anthropology. Indigenous tribes in Australia, Brazilian coffee farmers, political activists in Iran, a second grade class in Missoula, Montana; these are all groups of people you might study if you were into anthropology. Every culture has its own particular rituals, behaviors, and lifestyles, and people in the field of anthropology document the many varieties of human experience.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3142,"<ul><li>To applaud is to show approval, encouragement, or appreciation. You can applaud by clapping your hands at a performance, or you can applaud with just your mouth, as when you tell someone ""I applaud your decision to start exercising.""</li><li>The verb applaud goes back to the Latin verb applaudere, ""to clap,"" and it came into English use in the 15th century. Part of the word applaud is laud, which means ""praise,"" and laud is close in spelling to loud. When you applaud, you give loud praise by clapping you hands together. If you really like what someone is doing and want to pat them on the back for it or show encouragement, you might just say ""I applaud your efforts.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3143,"<ul><li>The President can appoint someone as ambassador to another county; that means to give them the job or recommend them for it.</li><li>It must be nice to be appointed. Usually, people who want a job have to send in applications, do interviews, and jump through lots of hoops. Appointing is different: someone with the power to appoint can usually just give you the job. In some cases, appointing isn't a sure thing and means something closer to ""recommending"" — but it still beats filling out all those applications. It takes power to appoint people, which is why world leaders are often the ones appointing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3144,"<ul><li>A word that comes up a lot in discussions of both food and people pairings, compatible speaks to a person or thing’s ability to exist agreeably with something or someone else.</li><li>Use the word compatible to describe two things that work well together, like your Wii and your big screen TV, or peanut butter and jelly. You may have heard that opposites attract, but initial attraction doesn’t necessarily mean that opposites will be compatible in the long-term. Advised Russian novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy, “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3145,"<ul><li>If you have competence, you're qualified or well prepared to do something. A driving test will show if you have competence behind the wheel.</li><li>If your dad discovers a new dent in his car each time you've borrowed it, don't be surprised if he questions your competence as a driver. The words competence and competency are sometimes used interchangeably, although competence is better when describing the quality of being well qualified. Competency is more appropriate in a legal sense, referring to the ability of a person to make decisions or stand trial.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3146,"<ul><li>If you gab, chat, and talk it up with someone, you have conversation, but if you're looking for input from each other as you talk, you confer, or consult, together. They had a family meeting to confer about a schedule for sharing the new laptop.</li><li>Many uses of the verb confer involve consulting with another person or as a group. Confer has a second use meaning ""bestow,"" which means to award or hand over something. You can confer a medal on a winner or hero, or you can confer status through a promotion or assignment. Each year the teacher would confer the special honor of summer hamster-sitter on one responsible student.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3147,"<ul><li>If things are consecutive, they happen one after the other with no break. If there are five consecutive snowstorms on five consecutive days,   you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.</li><li>Consecutive comes from the Latin consecutus, meaning ""following closely"" with no gap. Just like those snowstorms — one storm happened each day, back to back, for five days in a row. Consecutive numbers also follow each other, or advance in the right order. For example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are consecutive numbers. You should number the pages on a term paper to keep them consecutive so the teacher doesn't get confused.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3148,"<ul><li>Is it gross? Unsophisticated? Totally tasteless and positively offensive? Then you can describe it as crude.</li><li>Crude is not rude when it’s used to describe unprocessed oil, which it first was associated with in 1865. From the Latin crudo, meaning ""rough, raw,"" crude today can be used to describe anything or anyone that's unrefined and rough around the edges. So don’t be too insulted by the large-nosed portrait that cartoonist made for you. It’s just a quick, crude drawing meant to be funny.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3149,"<ul><li>In math, a cube is a number multiplied by itself three times. The cube of 2 is 8 (2 x 2 x 2). It is also a three-dimensional shape where each of the six sides is a square or something shaped like a cube, such as an ice cube or meat cut into cubes.</li><li>The noun cube goes back to the Greek word kybos, which was a six-sided die used in games. As a verb, cube means to cut into cube shapes. You can buy cookie dough that is ready for baking and formed into cubes. Place each cube on the cookie sheet, and the dough becomes a dozen round cookies — or fewer if you pop a cookie dough cube into your mouth before baking!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3150,"<ul><li>When you give feedback, it means you offer a helpful response to someone's work or idea.</li><li>If you were recording your first album and you asked friends for feedback on which songs to include, you'd be asking them to offer their critical opinions on your music. Feedback is almost always offered or requested with the intention of improving the final product. Another meaning of feedback is a kind of sound distortion from an amplifier or microphone. This sense of electronic feedback has been around since about 1920, while the ""critical response"" definition didn't come into use until 1955.</li></ul>"

Ignorance implies that a person or group needs to be educated on a particular subject. You might have heard the phrase ""ignorance is bliss,"" which means that sometimes it's easier when you don't know the whole truth about something and can be blissfully happy, unaware of unpleasant realities.</li></ul>"

When you hear a masculine voice outside greeting your neighbor, you know it’s your dad and not your mom.</li><li>Masculine can describe people or things that have qualities often associated with men. If someone has a masculine appearance, the person is probably tall and strong. If your new jacket has masculine tailoring, that means it’s cut like a man’s jacket. Masculine can also refer to words. In many languages, words — especially nouns — are given a gender. If you’ve studied French or Spanish, you know you need to figure out which article to use with a masculine noun.</li></ul>"

Many honor a specific person, while other are dedicated to soldiers who fought in a certain war, such as Vietnam or World War I. Cemeteries are also full of monuments, and monument can mean a type of burial vault. Whenever people create a monument, they're trying to make sure that a person or event is remembered.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3154,"<ul><li>If you're strong and athletic, with powerfully developed muscles, you can describe yourself as muscular.</li><li>Weight lifters are muscular, and so is the Incredible Hulk. If your grandmother has worked as a cattle farmer her entire life, she is probably pretty muscular too. Anyone with strong muscles can be described as muscular. In the 1600's, the word simply meant ""pertaining to muscles,"" but by the mid-1700's, muscular specifically referred to well-developed muscles. The root word is the Latin musculus, which, oddly enough, means both ""muscle"" and ""little mouse.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3155,"<ul><li>Posture is the way you position your body or arrange your limbs. So stand up straight, put your shoulders back, and lift that chin up.</li><li>Ballerinas have an elegant, graceful posture, and soldiers tend to display a rigid, strong posture. If you sit hunched over your desk every day you'll end up with terrible posture. This noun describes the way you carry yourself, but can also describe a certain body position you take, like the different postures in yoga. If you're accused of posturing though, that's a different story — that means you're behaving unnaturally to impress someone.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3156,"<ul><li>When you situate something, you figure out where it should go or exactly where it is. You might, for example, use a compass to situate the hunting camp you're building on your grandfather's land.</li><li>Your brother might decide to situate his drums in a far corner of the basement, where his banging is less likely to disturb the household. A land surveyor might use a GPS or satellite data to situate the boundaries of a particular property. In the 1530's, situate literally meant ""to give a site to,"" from the Medieval Latin situare, ""to place or locate,"" with the Latin root word situs, ""place or position.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3157,"<ul><li>If your mother asks you to supervise your little brother and his friends, it means she'd like you to keep an eye on them.</li><li>The verb supervise has origins in the Latin word supervidere, from super-, meaning “over” and videre, meaning “to see.” When you supervise something, it means you oversee the project, managing the people working on it, perhaps by figuring out what needs to be done, assigning the work, and making sure it gets done properly. You serve as the boss when you supervise; other people are the workers.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U08_3158,"<ul><li>Things that have symmetry are balanced, with each side reflecting the other. A human body has such complex symmetry, from eyes, ears, and nostrils to arms, legs, and feet, that even a minor injury can make a body look unbalanced.</li><li>Snowflakes and butterflies often have a remarkable natural symmetry, with patterns on one side matched by those on the other. Objects that have identical or very similar parts lying at equal distances from a central point or line or plane — that is, objects that have symmetry — often work better. Symmetry helps boats stay upright in water. In design, symmetry is a balancing of objects, as when two candlesticks on a fireplace mantel are at equal distances from the center of the mantel. A lack of symmetry — i.e., asymmetry — might mean putting both candlesticks together at one end of the mantel.</li></ul>"

If you want a butterfly tattoo but you're scared of needles, you might settle for a temporary version.</li><li>The word tattoo is also a verb meaning stain the skin using needles and ink. It's probably a good idea to wait until you've been dating someone for more than a week before you tattoo their name on your arm. In music, a tattoo is continuous drumming, and a military tattoo is a drum or bugle that signals soldiers to return to their quarters at the end of the day.</li></ul>"

After high school, you can become an undergraduate.</li><li>Undergraduates are students of universities and colleges: they've graduated from high school and have been accepted to college, but they haven't graduated yet. If the under in undergraduate seems confusing, that's because there are also graduate students, students who have a college degree but are no longer undergraduates and are pursuing an advanced degree, like a Master's or Ph.D. Lots of people say being an undergraduate was one of the best times of their lives: it's an exciting thing to be.</li></ul>"

If you're having a big barbecue party but would rather hang out with your friends than grill, you could pay someone to cater it.</li><li>In Middle English, the food supply in a big household was known as the cates, and so to cater meant keeping the pantry full. These days, caterers don't do pantries. They cook food for many different households or offices. Cater has also come to mean ""giving what is desired or needed."" You might cater to your grandfather by bringing him tea, reading to him, and laughing at his bad jokes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3162,"<ul><li>Being considerate is being polite and caring. People like it when you're considerate of their feelings.</li><li>We could all probably be more considerate of others: this word means you're thinking of other people — considering them — and then treating them decently and with respect. It's considerate to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to people. It's considerate to excuse yourself, rather than walking out and slamming the door. Asking someone how they feel is usually considerate. A considerate person is kind and thoughtful — a good person to know.</li></ul>"

Little kids often like their sandwiches with the crust cut off.</li><li>You’ve probably eaten lots of crusts —  bread crust, pie crust — any food that’s hard on the outside and soft on the inside has a crust. Crust is also a verb  meaning “to form a hard outer layer.” Crusting happens with more than just food, like when a layer of dirt crusts your clothes after a romp in the mud. The Earth has a hard crust too. Little kids don’t like to eat that either, usually.</li></ul>"

At some schools, being a senior might entitle students to go out for lunch on Fridays.</li><li>The most common use of entitle is the one you might see on a coupon, like one for a free ride at the state fair that entitles the holder to one free ride on the Octopus of Terror. When you entitle someone, you give them a claim to something, like when you entitle someone the best goalie in Canada, or make someone a member of the noble class, like when the Queen entitles, or gives a title to, a worthy person.</li></ul>"

Some escorts are there to protect you, some just to share a good time.</li><li>The word escort can be a noun or a verb — ""your escort escorts you."" This word is derived from the Latin excorrigere, ""to set out,"" and moved through the Italian scorgere, meaning ""to guide."" In the 1570s it took on a military tone as escorte, used to describe armed protectors for travelers. In the 19th century it came to mean ""accompanying a person on social occasions,"" although we still refer to military escorts today.</li></ul>"

The opposite of external is internal; again, as you’ve probably been told, it’s the internal things that really matter. What we’re wondering is: Does that include the leather interior in our dream convertible?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3169,"<ul><li>Facility is a noun with several different meanings. Often, as in ""storage facility,"" it's a place designed for a specific use, but it can also mean an effortlessness or ease with something.</li><li>The new stadium is a great facility for showing off Olympic winter sports. At this level, all of the ice skaters show a facility that borders on magical. Likewise, the prison is a great facility for storing prisoners. Those prisoners showed a real facility for crime. Related to the French facile, which means ""easy,"" a person who shows a facility for something makes it seem easy. This is cool, especially if that thing is difficult — or, as the French might say, difficile.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3170,"<ul><li>A faculty refers to any of your mental or physical abilities. If you lose your faculties, you are powerless. The faculty of a school is comprised of the people who work there. Lose them, and you have a different kind of problem.</li><li>Faculty comes from the Old French word faculté, which means “skill, accomplishment, or learning.” You may have great faculties of memory, sight, mobility, charm, math, and musicality, but, as Beethoven was in the end, be robbed of your faculty of hearing.  Any aptitude or ability — inborn or learned — that you have is a faculty. Also, if you go to school, your teachers make up the faculty of that school.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3171,"<ul><li>A great big pile of something is a heap. Your sloppy brother might keep all of his clothes in a heap on his bedroom floor.</li><li>A heap can be a literal mound of things — a heap of money in your piggy bank, or a heap of wet towels beside the pool — or it can be a figurative pile. For example, you might worry that if you're caught eating your roommate's pizza you'll be in a heap of trouble. Heap is also a verb, as when you heap compliments on your best friend. Since 1924 heap has also meant ""junky old car.""</li></ul>"

If it’s a cold winter in the northern hemisphere, take a winter getaway to sunbathe somewhere in the southern hemisphere.</li><li>Hemisphere comes from the Greek, and combines the prefix hemi-, for ""half,"" with sphere, or ""perfectly round ball."" We talk about the earth as divided at the equator into the northern and southern hemispheres (or divided at the prime meridian into eastern and western hemispheres). In biology, there are two cerebral, or brain, hemispheres — also known as the right and left sides of the brain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3173,"<ul><li>A hound is a type of dog with big floppy ears, mainly used for hunting. To hound someone is to relentlessly pursue or pester them. When Elvis sings, “You ain’t nothing but a hound dog,” he’s referring to both.</li><li>Hounds are dogs that have traditionally been used for hunting because they are excellent at tracking. Most hounds (like beagles and dachshunds) have drooping, floppy ears. Hounds can also be big and scary like the one Sherlock Holmes investigates in The Hound of the Baskervilles. If people hound, they hunt, too, but just in an annoying way. A man can hound a woman by asking for a date 10 times. A hounding person is persistent and probably annoying.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3174,"<ul><li>If you're impersonal, you're neutral — you're not showing your feelings or your preference. If you choose people to be on your team by closing your eyes and pointing, that's impersonal — you're not picking your friends or the best players.</li><li>Impersonal can be good. An impersonal rejection is easier to take than one that specifies precisely why you, in particular, are a reject. But if your class is so impersonal, your teacher doesn't even know your name, that’s not good. A wedding that doesn't include details about the bride and groom would be impersonal and may be more like a business meeting than a celebration. Impersonal comes from the Latin roots in- or im-, ""not,"" and personalis, ""of a person.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3175,"<ul><li>To lick is to taste or touch with the tongue. When your dog licks you, he's saying hello. Humans should opt for waving hello over licking.</li><li>Animal mothers lick their babies to clean them, and adult cats also groom themselves this way. People generally lick things to taste them: you might lick an ice cream cone or a lollipop, or lick salt off your arm after a day at the beach. Colloquially, to lick an opponent is to beat them at a game or fight. In jazz music, a lick is a short burst of music, or a solo.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3176,"<ul><li>An ornament is a decoration. You can also ornament something by making it more beautiful or festive.</li><li>The most common use of ornament is probably in Christmas ornaments, which decorate a tree. Similarly, any ornament makes something prettier, flashier, or more festive. When you ornament something, you're beautifying, embellishing, or adorning it. Women ornament themselves with makeup. Men ornament themselves with face paint at football games. People ornament their offices with pictures of their families. Different cultures have their own ways of ornamenting themselves and their homes. If something looks boring, why not ornament it?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3177,"<ul><li>A pedestrian is someone traveling by foot. If you're a pedestrian, you will likely get annoyed at the drivers who don't stop so you can cross the street.</li><li>Pedestrian comes from the Latin pedester meaning ""going on foot"" but also ""plain."" As a noun, it's someone walking around — sidewalks are for pedestrians. As an adjective it means ""lacking wit or imagination."" If someone calls your new poem pedestrian, they mean it's dull. If you want to impress your friends while also making them feel worthless, mutter ""these people are SO pedestrian,"" at a party, loud enough for everyone to hear.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3178,"<ul><li>The word sanctuary has religious roots, and can refer to a temple or church, but its use has broadened to include anywhere people go for peaceful tranquility or introspection.  Your pickup truck might be your sanctuary if that's where you can clear your head.</li><li>Historically, a sanctuary is the holiest of holy places — a temple or church. Now, it's a word for anywhere a person feels especially safe and serene. People might call their homes their sanctuary, or a beautiful spot in a quiet woods can be described as a sanctuary. It can also be a way to refer to shelter or asylum from political danger, such as: ""The forbidding jungle can offer sanctuary to the guerrilla rebels.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U09_3179,"<ul><li>If you're watching something, you're a spectator. Football stadiums and circus tents are full of spectators.</li><li>The spectator is a particular kind of viewer; unlike a witness or an onlooker, they usually have chosen intentionally to regard the spectacle before them. Usually the word spectator refers to people watching games or ""spectator sports,"" but you could be a spectator at any planned event. An easy way to remember this word is to think of spectacles, glasses used to view something clearly — both from the same Latin root spectare.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U10_3181,"<ul><li>Whether we're talking about a fog light for your boat or just a nice hat to go with your boating outfit, an accessory is something you add to something else to make it better.</li><li>An accessory can be any piece of clothing that you wear or carry as long as it isn't part of the main outfit.  You can also use the word to refer to someone who helps someone else commit a crime.  So the guy who distracted the old lady while another guy grabbed her purse? He was the accessory to the theft of an accessory.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3182,"<ul><li>An acquisition is something you acquire — a book, a skill or if you are a mogul, a company. It describes things you have purchased, things you have learned, or things you have gotten.</li><li>Acquisition has a formal sense to it. We don't talk about our new jeans as our latest acquisition, unless we are the kind of person who refers to their latest copy of Vogue as their Bible. It is very commonly used to refer to paintings purchased by museums — in fact, large museums have acquisition departments.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3183,"<ul><li>The heavy, rigid paper that's used to make the boxes you use for mailing things is called cardboard. Cardboard also comes in handy for crafts and projects in classrooms.</li><li>A lot of cardboard is made from several layers of thick paper, so that it's stiff and strong, and protects items inside cardboard boxes. You can also use the word cardboard to describe a fictional character who doesn't seem real: ""The mother in the movie was such a cardboard character."" In the 18th century, cardboard was known as card paper.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3184,"<ul><li>A dilemma is a tough choice. When you're in a difficult situation and each option looks equally bad, you're in a dilemma.</li><li>Dilemma is from a Greek for ""double proposition."" It was originally a technical term of logic, but we use it now for any time you have a problem with no satisfactory solution. If you're at the mall choosing between red or blue socks, that's not really a dilemma. But if you have to choose whether to save your cat or your dog from a burning building, that's an awful dilemma.</li></ul>"

The word comes from the Latin elaborare, which means ""to produce by labor"" but it has come to mean a lot of labor, especially work that is very complicated and precise. To imagine this word, think of a painting with lots of flourishes or a story with many sub-plots and characters that all fit together in extensive ways.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3186,"<ul><li>If something's exact, it's precise and completely accurate — as opposed to a guess, an estimate, or an approximation.</li><li>Exact also has the meaning of taking something from someone, often money, and generally only given up with reluctance under the threat of force. The Mob might exact a shakedown from unfortunate businessmen, for example. The word comes from the Latin exactus ""exact or accurate,"" a form of the verb exigere — meaning ""to force out or demand,"" like the Mob demanding its money.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3187,"<ul><li>To facilitate means to make something easier. If your best friend is very shy, you could facilitate her efforts to meet new people.</li><li>Facilitate comes from the Latin facilis, for ""easy."" It means to make something easier or more likely to happen. You facilitate growth or a process, as opposed to, say, dinner.  Often in business meetings someone will be assigned to facilitate a discussion so people don't just sit in awkward silence. Synonyms are ease, simplify, expedite, and assist.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3188,"<ul><li>A fleet is usually a large group of ships, but it can be any group of vessels like planes or cars that operate as a unit. A naval fleet is the largest formation of warships. A naval fleet at sea is like an army on land.</li><li>One meaning of fleet comes from the Old English fleot, meaning “ship,” “raft,” or “floating vessel.” Although a fleet is usually a group of ships or airplanes operating under the same ownership, any group of vessels sailing together can be called a fleet, even you and your friends in a fleet of kayaks. Another meaning of fleet originates in the Old English flēotan, which means “moving swiftly.” When it’s used in that way, it’s usually in the -ing form, fleeting.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3189,"<ul><li>A grid is a network of intersecting parallel lines, whether real or imaginary. Most American streets are laid out in a grid pattern, meaning the streets intersect at right angles and form a pattern of squares when viewed from above.</li><li>You've probably seen a map grid, the uniform lines drawn on a map that allow you to pinpoint a particular location. Grid can also refer to a physical network of sorts, not necessarily made of straight or parallel lines. You may be familiar with the high voltage electrical cables that carry power throughout the country, known as the national grid. A grid can also be a device made up of intersecting metal bars that you use when grilling food.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3190,"<ul><li>Imports are the products shipped into our country from other places. We import Japanese autos and export our pop music to Tokyo. Import also means to signify something. Is it of import to our economic security to have so many Japanese imports on our roads?</li><li>The origins of the word import are literally ""to bring into port."" The ratio of imports to exports is a big indicator of the health of a nation's economy. The word import can also refer to attitudes or behaviors that come as part of the culture of a place. ""New York media is dominated by British journalists who have imported the snarky style of gossip reporting famous in London.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3191,"<ul><li>When you infer something, you read between the lines. To infer  is to make a well informed guess — if you see your mom’s bag on the table, you might infer that she’s home.</li><li>When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they mean but haven't actually said. It’s like guessing, but not making wild guesses. You're making deductions — guesses based on logic. Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a scientist has part of a dinosaur fossil and can infer what the rest of the dinosaur looked like. When you see the word infer, think ""educated guess.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3192,"<ul><li>Using your own breath or an air pump, you can inflate a balloon — or anything else you need to pump air into. When you inflate something you fill it with air (or any other gas) to make it expand.</li><li>From the Latin verb inflāre, ""to blow into,"" the word inflate appeared in English in the early 16th century. Although we usually think of the word inflate as referring to blowing air or gas into a balloon or a tire, anything that grows larger, from food prices to an egoist's self-image, can be inflated. When an item becomes scarce, its price is likely to be inflated.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3193,"<ul><li>If a characteristic or ability is already present in a person or animal when they are born, it is innate. People have the innate ability to speak whereas animals do not.</li><li>Innate can also be used figuratively for something that comes from the mind rather than from external sources. Do you know someone with an innate sense of style? Some kids seem to have an innate sense of fairness where others seem to be natural bullies. In some contexts, innate means inherent. There is an innate sadness in certain types of ceremonies.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3194,"<ul><li>Marble is a very hard rock that's a particular type of limestone. Fancy lobbies (and even bathrooms) are often lined with marble.</li><li>Marble's unique qualities make it a popular stone for artists and kitchen designers alike — the white stone statues you find in most museums, some of them dating back to ancient Greece and Rome, are carved from white marble. High-end kitchen counters are often made from polished slabs of darker colored marble. A single marble is a glass ball swirled with marble-like colors, and ""to marble"" is to paint with similar swirls and whorls.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3195,"<ul><li>A mast is a pole that rises vertically from a ship and supports the sails. Really big sailboats have more than one mast. A mast is also another name for flagpole.</li><li>The mast has an important job — to support the sails, which allows the wind to propel the ship. Other types of masts are used to support flags and called flagpoles. If you've ever seen a flag at half-mast, it's been lowered down the flagpole to show respect for someone who died. Mast is an old word meaning “pole or rod.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3196,"<ul><li>When you feel like you might throw up, that's nausea. I know you're feeling sea sick, but if our boat sinks, nausea will be the least of your problems.</li><li>Nausea gets its root from the Greek word for ship, naus, so it might have originally meant sea sickness in particular.  Remembering this origin might help you spell nausea correctly too, since it ends with “sea.”  But nausea can strike on dry land just as well, from eating the wrong thing, catching the flu, reading on a moving bus...just thinking of it all makes me sick to my stomach.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3197,"<ul><li>Naval means ""about a navy or navies."" If you are interested in naval history, you probably enjoy seeing ships used in sea battles.</li><li>Naval comes from the Latin word for ship, navis. Use the adjective naval whenever you're discussing a country's fleet of ships, especially ships intended for use during wartime. You might talk about a naval officer or a naval base, where ships are kept and naval personnel live. It's easy to confuse naval with its homophone navel, the belly button.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3198,"<ul><li>A pouch is a small container or bag, like the pouch full of dog treats you carry when you take your new puppy to obedience school. Sit! Stay! Good boy.</li><li>It used to be much more common for people to carry things around in pouches for safety and convenience — money pouches, mail pouches, tobacco pouches, and so on. Often these were drawstring bags that cinched securely at the top. The word came to be used for other things with a similar shape, including animal cavities meant for carrying babies (think a kangaroo's pouch) and various pocket-shaped receptacles.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U10_3199,"<ul><li>Saturated means drenched and full. When you fish out a slice of bread that’s fallen into your water glass and find it’s disgustingly spongy and waterlogged, it’s saturated.</li><li>Saturated originally meant “satisfied,"" but by the 1700s it could mean “soaked thoroughly.” In the twentieth century it developed marketing connotations, as in a saturated market — one without room for competition. In chemistry, saturated refers to an organic compound, like a fatty acid, that contains the highest number of hydrogen atoms possible. When it comes to color, saturated means pure, or undiluted with white, grey, or black.</li></ul>"

The process of doing this can also be called an update.</li><li>If you decide to download the latest version of an app or program, you update it, and when you add recent information to your resume before starting a job search, you also update that. You might also update your friends about your job hunt, letting them know you're seeking employment — you're giving them the latest information, or an update. The verb dates from the 1940s.</li></ul>"

But if you're a chronic smoker, you've been smoking for a long time and will have a hard time stopping.</li><li>The word chronic is used to describe things that occur over a long period of time and, in fact, comes from the Greek word for time, khronos. If you have chronic asthma, it is a recurring health issue for you. No one likes a chronic liar! A problem that cannot be solved can also be called chronic - think of the chronic food shortages in certain parts of the world.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3203,"<ul><li>When you have discipline, you have self-control. When you discipline children, you are either teaching them to be well-behaved, or you are punishing and correcting them.</li><li>The origins of this word offer great clues about its current meanings. The Old French descepline referred to punishment and suffering. The Latin disciplina meant ""teaching, learning."" The Old English version referred to a branch of knowledge or field of study (so if you're really good at word origins, you might want to make etymology your discipline). Developing discipline as a form of training is a military concept that's more than 500 years old.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3204,"<ul><li>A donor is a person who donates something of value to a person or an organization, especially a charity. A wealthy donor might leave her book collection to the local library in her will.</li><li>Buildings on college campuses are frequently named after generous donors — if you give millions of dollars to your school, they might name the new library after you, crediting you as a donor. Another kind of donor gives blood that can be used for transfusions, or agrees to donate organs after his or her death. Donor comes from the Latin root donare, ""give as a gift.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3205,"<ul><li>Fellow is an old fashioned word for “guy.” If you’re wearing a top hat, you may address someone as “my good fellow.” It’s also a non-stuffy word to describe people in the same situation, such as you and your fellow Vocabulary.com fans.</li><li>Other words for fellow include ""chap"" and ""dude."" A fellow can also be someone’s boyfriend, as in “Is he your fellow?” an interested suitor might ask. Another kind of fellow is an academic who's either reached a high position or won a prestigious scholarship. A MacArthur Fellow, for example, is a person who won a MacArthur fellowship (a well-deserved hunk of money). Fellow comes from an Old English word, feolaga, ""one who shares with another.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3206,"<ul><li>Gossip is conversation that's light, informal, and usually about other people's business. It can be fun to gossip about others, but no one likes it when they're the subject of gossip.</li><li>You can find people just about anywhere who love to chatter about the latest rumors and stories: they're gossips who love to gossip. You've probably seen all the celebrity gossip featured in the tabloids: stories about who's dating, marrying, divorcing, or having a baby. But don't trust everything you hear — gossip isn't always accurate, and often people spread untrue gossip just to mess with someone they don't like.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3207,"<ul><li>To graduate means to successfully complete your schooling, to become ""a graduate."" When you graduate from high school, you become a high school graduate and congratulations are in order.</li><li>A graduate is someone who has received a degree from a school. As a verb graduate refers to the act of receiving this degree “I plan to graduate from college in the spring,” or the act of giving a degree “I want to graduate all of my students.” In a scientific sense, graduate can mean to calibrate for fine adjustments. To make a thermometer, you have to graduate it by degrees so it displays a range of temperatures.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3208,"<ul><li>Graffiti is a word, phrase, or image painted or drawn somewhere in public, like on the side of a building or on the walls in a restroom.</li><li>Art or vandalism?  That’s the debate about graffiti.  For some people, graffiti looks ugly and damages the property where it’s left.  Others consider graffiti a form of self-expression and a celebration of public spaces.  The word comes from the Italian graffito, which means “a scratch,” and like a deep scratch, graffiti can be difficult to remove.   It’s also difficult to spell, but remember that there are two fs and only one t and you’ll get it right every time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3209,"<ul><li>A guardian is a keeper or protector who looks after the welfare of other people or their property. In legal language, guardian is typically used as an alternative to ""parent.""</li><li>Guardians are often adults who can make legal decisions for children who are not their own. Sometimes they take care of them, too, just like a parent would. A guardian angel is a figure that some people believe (either seriously or jokingly) watches over them and protects them. The term is also used to describe people who believe they are ""guarding"" something important, like morality, culture, or fashion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3210,"<ul><li>The verb implicate means ""to connect or involve in something."" For example, your cousins might implicate you in the planning of a big party for your grandparents.</li><li>Implicate comes from the Latin word implicare, meaning ""to entwine, involve."" When you implicate someone, you bring him or her into a group or to pitch in on a project. Implicate can have criminal connotations when it means ""to connect in an incriminating manner,"" like when detectives figure out who drove the getaway car in the bank robbery — that person will be implicated for his or her role in the crime.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3211,"<ul><li>Some say kin, others say ""family"" or ""relatives."" Call them what you will, but you’re stuck with those people related to you by blood or marriage.</li><li>When someone refers to their kith and kin, she means her friends and family. Both words date back to Old English, with kin reaching back to the 700s. Originally referring to one’s family or race, kin narrowed to refer just to one’s blood relations. Your ""next of kin"" is your closest family member: spouse, child, parent, or sibling.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3212,"<ul><li>That guy on the field in black and white stripes? He's a referee, an official in a sport like football or basketball who enforces the rules.</li><li>In sports, referees are there to make sure the rules are followed and everyone gets a fair shake. This word works as both a noun and a verb: referees referee games. Off the court, the world is full of everyday referees. A court appointed lawyer who investigates and reports on a case is a referee. And academics who evaluate each other's work are referees. In all cases, referees get to make official calls on what's OK and not OK.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3213,"<ul><li>To sever something is to cut it off from the whole. If your girlfriend breaks up with you on your anniversary, you might respond by severing the blossoms off the roses you were planning to give her. (Just an idea.)</li><li>Sever rhymes with ever, but it looks like the word severe, which means ""harsh."" The similarity between sever and severe is a good reminder to reserve sever for harsh, unpleasant circumstances. If you’re trimming your fingernails, you might use the word clip, but sever wouldn’t be appropriate. If, however, you somehow cut off your finger while clipping your fingernails, you’re free to use the word sever — or any other word you like — on your way to the hospital.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3214,"<ul><li>The noun shaft refers to something that resembles a long, thin pole, such as the long part of an arrow between the tip and the feathers.</li><li>The word shaft can describe all kinds of things that are long and thin, such a shaft of light or a spear or the handle of a golf club or the midsection of a long bone. A shaft can also be a long narrow tunnel, generally one that runs straight up and down, such as a mine shaft or an elevator shaft. You might think these items don’t have much in common, but think about their shape: they’re all long, straight, and thin.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3215,"<ul><li>To stab is to thrust or jab something sharp, the way you stab your sandwich with a toothpick or the way Brutus (and others) stab Julius Caesar in Shakespeare's play.</li><li>You can stab at the soil in your garden with a trowel or stab the steak on your plate with a fork. You might then experience a stab (or sharp feeling) of regret, wondering if you should become a vegetarian. When you ""take a stab at something,"" you attempt it: ""I decided to take a stab at opera singing."" Stab comes from the Scottish stob, ""to pierce.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3216,"<ul><li>A stimulus causes an action or response, like the ringing of your alarm clock if you didn't sleep through it.</li><li>Stimulus is a word often used in biology — something that causes a reaction in an organ or cell, for example. In financial and economic contexts, a stimulus may be an incentive: the money you spend on your membership is a stimulus for hitting the gym. Though it can be a synonym for stimulant, they are not always used interchangeably. A stimulant is often a chemical or drug that increases activity — think caffeine. For more than one stimulus, use stimuli, not stimuluses.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3217,"<ul><li>Suspicion is a feeling that something might be true. If your friends seem to be keeping a secret from you, you might have a suspicion that they are planning a surprise party for your birthday.</li><li>Suspicion can mean the same as hunch or inkling, like when you have a suspicion that your friend is hiding a flower bouquet behind his back. Suspicion comes from the Latin word suspicere, or mistrust. That's why it can mean a general bad feeling about someone or something, like neighbors who regard all new people with suspicion until they get to know them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3218,"<ul><li>To terminate something is to bring it to an end. Period. Full stop.</li><li>In ancient Rome, Terminus was the God of landmarks, boundaries, and endings. That’s why his annual party took place at the end of the year.  You can imagine the guests walking around in their togas, going, “This party is so great, I wish it would never terminate.” Nowadays, terminate can be used to refer to bringing anything to an end — including one's job or a product line: ""When the Weird Food Company announces plans to terminate production of its deep-fried chocolate-covered pickle line, it will be a sad day for lovers of strange snacks.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3219,"<ul><li>A theme can be an underlying topic of a discussion or a recurring idea in an artistic work. Anxiety about getting married is a big theme in romantic comedies.</li><li>From ancient Greek thema (via Latin and French) we get this word, whose many related uses all have to do with the idea of ""the main subject of something."" In music, it can be a recurring melody in a composition, or an entire song throughout a play or film (a theme song). It can also describe the decor of a setting: ""The amusement park had a Wild West theme.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U11_3220,"<ul><li>Tuition is a fee paid for instruction or teaching, usually for higher education. Many students need to get part-time jobs to pay their college tuition.</li><li>The word tuition comes from the Anglo-French word tuycioun, meaning ""protection, care, custody."" 
Some people say college protects you from the ""real world,"" at least while you are in school, but tuition is a reality all students face. Tuition can describe any payment made for instruction, however, even for a knitting class. That tuition can probably be covered without student loans or scholarships, though.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3221,"<ul><li>Someone or something aggressive shows a lot of energy and has a strong impact. After the aggressive salesman stopped them again on their way through the mall, the couple got aggressive and replied in a loud, made-up foreign language until he went away.</li><li>Being aggressive often means being physical or showing force, but it is equally powerful as an adjective reflecting a forceful determination to get something done. An aggressive football player may tackle everyone in sight to get a win, while a driven student might tackle a project or problem head-on with aggressive determination to improve their grade. Aggressive comes from the Latin aggress-, ""attack,"" and being aggressive shows an intention to attack bodily, mentally, or verbally whatever gets in the way.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3222,"<ul><li>Amnesty can mean a pardon for a wrongdoing, or it can also signal a government's willingness to overlook something.</li><li>Amnesty sounds a little like ""amnesia,"" and that's because in its more specific sense amnesty means ""forgetting."" The government will essentially forget about whatever crime was committed, or whatever horrible things were said. As part of a truce, amnesty can be granted to opposition forces in civil disputes. Amnesty to illegal aliens means the government will deliberately overlook their illegal entry to the country. There can also be a period of amnesty when people can turn in something that they would otherwise get in trouble for. ""The city offered a period of amnesty for everyone to turn in illegal guns.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3223,"<ul><li>If you're watching a college basketball game in person, chances are you're in an arena — a building specially designed for sporting events and large-scale rock concerts.</li><li>There's not much difference between an arena and a stadium, although an arena is enclosed and a stadium sometimes has an open roof. Football is usually played in a stadium, while basketball and other sports typically hold their games in arenas. The word arena originally meant ""place of combat,"" and it's sometimes still used this way. Its root is harena, a kind of sand that was supposedly used on the floor during ancient Roman battles to soak up spilled blood.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3224,"<ul><li>Whenever you check out a concert or a play, you sit in an auditorium — that is, the section of a theater or concert hall reserved for the audience. You can try sitting on the stage, but you'll probably be thrown out.</li><li>Sometimes auditorium refers to the whole building where performances take place, not just the area for the audience. As the spelling of the word suggests, it's related to the word auditory, meaning ""something related to hearing."" In fact, auditorium is a Latin term meaning ""a place where something is heard,"" — and of course, as high school and college students know all too well, that can mean lectures as well as concerts or plays.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3225,"<ul><li>A captive is something that has been captured and can’t escape, like a prisoner of war or a panda in a zoo.</li><li>To be captured on the battlefield, and held captive is not so great, but captive doesn’t always describe things that are completely bad, like its synonym, hostage. If you fall in love you might say your heart is being held captive. Ideas that entrance you could be called captivating. Sometimes endangered animals are brought into captivity in order to breed larger populations, and then released into the wild.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3226,"<ul><li>Combat is fighting between two groups of armed forces.  When you engage in combat, typically this means you engage in fighting that involves weapons.</li><li>Combat comes from the Latin com- meaning ""together with"" and battere meaning ""to fight."" Combat can be used as a modifier; for example, a combat zone is an area where fighting is taking place. The word combat can also be used to refer to the action of fighting against something to prevent it. An after-school program for kids is working to combat the issue of street violence by creating a safe space where kids can go as an alternative.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3227,"<ul><li>Something commonplace is ordinary. It can also be something dull and unchallenging or tired and clichéd. Coffee shops in cities are commonplace, so are berets in Paris. You see them all over the place.</li><li>Things that are common can be found all over the place — they're commonplace! The word is a literal translation of the Latin locus communis for ""general topic."" Commonplace things and behavior are ordinary. For example, a commonplace job is a boring, mind-numbing task. It’s humdrum and unglamorous. A commonplace word or saying is a cliché — it's so common that it becomes meaningless and annoying.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3228,"<ul><li>If you compound a problem you add something to it to make it worse, like say, putting water on a grease fire. Compound means to combine; a compound is a combination or mixture of two or more things.</li><li>Compound has several specialized uses. A compound is either a mixture or two or more things, or a heavily guarded residence. In botany, a compound leaf consists of more than one part. In linguistics, a compound is a word that consists of two or more independent words. In chemistry, a compound is a substance created when atoms from chemical elements join together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3229,"<ul><li>A corps is an army unit consisting of at least two divisions. This word can also refer to other groups of people, like a press corps, which is a gang of journalists trying to get the scoop.</li><li>Although the word corps comes from the Latin corpus, for “body,” don’t pronounce the p or you’re talking about the kind of body that goes in a coffin. The main meaning of a corps (which is singular despite the s) is a unit of the army. The word applies to other groups, too. A law firm has a corps of lawyers, a doctor has a corps of nurses, and a tiny car could have a corps of clowns.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3230,<ul><li>Distract is what you do when you draw someone’s attention — Hey! Look! Over there! Oh. Never mind. What was I saying? That’s right: distract is to draw attention away from what someone is doing.</li><li>Distract comes from the Latin word for “draw apart.” It can be annoying when someone or something distracts you. A loud car alarm or a talkative friend might distract you when you’re watching your favorite TV show. But being distracted is not always bad. Playing a round of miniature golf might distract you from feeling sad about the death of your parakeet.</li></ul>
4000EEW_B06_U12_3231,"<ul><li>Today, most of the time someone or something is described as dumb when it shows a lack of thought, like your dumb idea of wearing flip-flops in a snowstorm.</li><li>Dumb is the Old English word that means ""mute, speechless,"" and itself came from an even older word dheubh meaning ""confusion, stupefaction, dizziness."" Today, dumb still means ""unable to speak,"" but it doesn't have anything to do with intelligence. Its other meaning, however, does. If you make a dumb mistake, it's something you could have avoided if you thought it through first.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3232,"<ul><li>A foe is an enemy. Foes can range from an adversary of one person to that of a nation, from “he is my foe” to “they are my foe.” There is also a “that is my foe” who those who are trying to diet know well, aka chocolate.</li><li>A cousin of the word feud (though they don’t get a long of course) foe may refer to a military opponent or a personal nemesis or rival — Lex Luthor is Superman’s foe. Historically, foes often come in pairs — such as the North and the South in the Civil War. The word foe is sometimes used for an opposing concept or a thing — if you are on a diet, chocolate may be your foe.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3233,"<ul><li>To hack is to cut or chop something with short strong blows, like if you hack your way through a thick jungle with a machete. To hack is also to illegally break into someone’s computer.</li><li>The Old English root word is haccian, which means “to cut into pieces,” but hack also means to cough frequently. A tickle in your throat can make you hack. If you call someone a hack, you mean they’re not great at what they do — especially writing. A mediocre writer is called a hack. Once upon a time hack was short for “an ordinary horse,” and now it’s an insult for writers. No one wants to be a hack!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3234,"<ul><li>When you meditate, you silently calm or focus your mind for relaxation or spiritual reasons. People who meditate regularly can put a stop to racing thoughts, making them less distracted.</li><li>When you meditate, you focus on your breathing while sitting calmly. Some people mediate to reduce stress, while others see it as part of their spiritual practice. Meditate can also be used to describe any deep thinking you do, like when you meditate on what to say to a friend who is feeling sad lately. The Latin word for ""ponder,"" meditari, is the root of meditate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3235,"<ul><li>A nick is a tiny cut or scratch. Your neighbor might be so proud and protective of his brand new car that even a nick in its paint would be deeply upsetting to him.</li><li>To make a nick is also to nick: you might accidentally nick your dog when you're cutting tangles and mats out of her fur, or nick yourself when you're gathering up pieces of a broken glass in the sink. Informally, you also nick someone when you cheat them out of some cash or nick something when you steal it. If help arrives ""in the nick of time,"" it comes at the very last possible second.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3236,"<ul><li>Anything that brings about a strong reaction can be said to provoke. You can provoke that lion if you want. But if he responds by attacking, don't come running to me.</li><li>Let's consider some people who have been known to provoke. Lenny Bruce, was more than just a comedian. He was a ""provocateur"" who used humor to deliver his controversial diatribes. Humor was his way to provoke people to think. Madonna made her name not only by producing a memorable catalogue of great pop songs, she proved herself to be a master at provoking people through her outrageous attire and lyrics. The moral of this story? It's possible to provoke both positive and negative responses.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3237,"<ul><li>A realm is an area that is ruled by something. If you are a controlling cook who doesn’t like anyone to do anything else in the kitchen, then the kitchen is your realm.</li><li>Realm comes from the French for kingdom, but since there aren’t so many kings or queens left in the world, you’ll more often find it referring to non-royal spheres. That could be the sphere of a special kind of knowledge, like the realm of biology, or the political realm. Or it could be an area dominated by some group. Little Italy was famously the realm of the mafia; Hollywood is the realm of film stars.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3238,"<ul><li>Rain falls from above, and people who reign rule from a position above others. They reign over countries and governments, and even over businesses and arts, as in ""She used to reign over punk music, always topping the charts.""</li><li>While reign is a verb when it refers to the actions of a person or group of people, the period of time when they reign is also called a reign, as a noun: ""His reign over the rodeo circuit ended when he was tackled by a bull named Princess-Maker."" Sometimes a stretch of time is called a reign, even without regard to who was the leader, as in a ""reign of peace,"" or a period of time without war and conflict, in a place or government.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3239,"<ul><li>Rust is the reddish-brown stuff that forms over time on metal that's gotten wet. Your dad's beat-up old car probably has some rust on it somewhere.</li><li>If you leave your bike out overnight in the rain, it'll be fine — you can dry it off the next day. If you leave it out for several rainy weeks, though, your bike will end up with rust on it. Rust appears as brown spots where the combination of water and oxygen has coated the metal with a compound that chemists call an oxide. Rust, which is also a verb, comes from a Germanic root meaning ""redness.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U12_3240,"<ul><li>Something sacred is holy, devoted to a religious ceremony, or simply worthy of awe and respect. Jerusalem is a sacred place for many religions, just as Fenway is a sacred place for Red Sox fans.</li><li>Sacred is an adjective used to describe a person or thing worthy of worship or declared holy. It usually appears in a religious context, but an object or place set aside for a particular purpose can also be sacred. Sacred spaces and items are intended to be treated with care and respect — even if it's just your shrine to Brad Pitt.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3241,"<ul><li>The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal.</li><li>Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning ""perception,"" comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has ""aesthetic value,"" it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an ""aesthetic painting.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3242,"<ul><li>Arrogant is an adjective for describing people who are too proud and look down on others, like supermodels who think their good looks give them a right to do whatever they want.</li><li>Arrogant derives from Latin arrogare ""to claim,"" and the idea is that someone is claiming credit or advantages that they are not entitled to. It's close in meaning to haughty and supercilious, but both of those have connotations of coolness and perceived superiority that arrogant does not.  An aristocrat could be called all three, but a customs official or traffic cop is more likely to be called arrogant than the other terms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3243,"<ul><li>Use the noun bias to mean a preference for one thing over another, especially an unfair one.</li><li>Some biases are completely innocent: ""I have a bias toward French wines."" But most often, bias is used to describe unfair prejudices: ""The authorities investigated a case involving bias against Latinos."" It is also a verb meaning ""to show prejudice for or against,"" as in ""They claimed the tests were biased against women."" (In British English, it takes an extra S in the forms biassed and biassing.) The word goes back at least to Old Provençal, a former language of southern France, in association with the sport of lawn bowling, where it referred to the tendency of a ball to roll in one direction or the other.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3244,"<ul><li>A canyon is a deep, narrow valley surrounded by tall cliffs. Because a canyon is often very deep, be very cautious when standing on the rocky cliffs above.</li><li>The noun canyon refers to a deep ravine that has been cut into the earth's surface over a long period of time by erosion from a running river. Also known as a gorge, it usually has very steep walls with rocky cliffs. One of the most famous examples is the Grand Canyon, which was cut by the Colorado River. It's an astounding 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and a mile deep.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3245,"<ul><li>A creek is a stream — like a river, but smaller — and if you grew up in the TV version of rural America, you probably had a creek babbling through your backyard and a dog that looked like Lassie.</li><li>If you're ""up a creek,"" or ""up a creek without a paddle,"" you've got a problem with no solution in sight. Say you're out in the middle of nowhere, your cell phone battery has just died, and your car won't start. Unless you've got a solar charger or a tow truck comes along, you're definitely up a creek.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3246,"<ul><li>A drill is a power tool that's used for making narrow holes or sometimes for pushing screws into wood or other hard material. The word is also a verb to describe the action a drill performs. For example, a dentist might drill into your tooth if you have a cavity.</li><li>A carpenter's drill can be held in one hand, while an oil drill is a large rig that hollows out holes in rock through which oil can flow. To drill is to bore holes in a hard surface, and it's also to teach something by repeating facts over and over: ""I hate math, because my teacher just drills multiplication tables."" Drill has a Dutch root, drillen, ""to bore a hole, turn around, or whirl.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3247,"<ul><li>An executive is a powerful person who is responsible for making things run smoothly.  If you become an executive, you might be in charge of an organization, a business, or even an entire country.</li><li>The executive of a company has the best office and works on ways to make their business more successful.  The Medieval Latin root of executive is exsequi, which means “carry out,” and so an executive carries out plans and actions.  Executive is also an adjective that describes having the power to make decisions.  The president of the United States is the executive branch of the government and is responsible for executing laws that will improve the country for its citizens.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3248,"<ul><li>Swimming and playing volleyball at the beach can make you tired and pleasantly wiped out, but long hours filling and emptying a wheelbarrow of dirt on a hot day brings fatigue, a far more draining kind of exhaustion.</li><li>There is a noticeable difference between tiredness and fatigue. You can read a magazine or book before bed and get tired after a while, but if you work on math problems on a computer for a long time, you'll feel fatigue in your eyes, and maybe your brain will start to hurt. The Latin fatīgāre means to ""tire out,"" ""to fill to excess or to bursting."" Even thinking about the Latin for fatigue brings some mental fatigue.</li></ul>"

If you like to walk up and down hills, you enjoy walking on inclines.</li><li>The Latin root of the word incline is inclinare, meaning ""to lean."" As a verb, the word incline can mean to bend, so you incline your head. It can also mean to be favorably disposed toward something and you can think of it as having a bent for or leaning toward something. If the weather is nasty, you may be inclined to stay home to watch a movie with a bowl of popcorn at your side.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3250,"<ul><li>Something nasty is filthy, foul, dirty, or awful. Nasty isn't a word for anything nice.</li><li>The main meaning of nasty is for things that are unpleasant and very gross. If someone throws up in class, at least one student will probably say, ""That's nasty!"" The smell of a bathroom is nasty. A song full of dirty words is nasty in a different way. Nasty can also mean ""extremely."" In football, a vicious hit can be called a nasty hit. A mean person is a nasty person too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3251,"<ul><li>When we perceive something, we become aware of or notice it. Sometimes we perceive things by using our senses of sight, hearing, and smell.</li><li>Or we can use our mind to perceive things, which means that we are able to recognize or understand them. We can also perceive a person or thing as having certain qualities: Do you perceive yourself as a good student? The Latin root percipere means ""to receive, understand,"" from the prefix per- ""thoroughly"" plus capere ""to seize, take.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3252,"<ul><li>A primate is a monkey, ape, human, or other similar mammal. You've probably visited the primate house at the zoo.</li><li>When you see the word primate, you probably think of monkeys. A monkey is just one example of a primate, though — lemurs are primates too, and so are gibbons, and even people. The things we all have in common are large brains, opposable thumbs, bendy toes, and good eyesight. The Latin word primas, or ""first,"" is the root of primate, which scientists sometimes call ""the highest order of mammals.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3253,"<ul><li>When we talk about ""primitive man"", we're usually talking about cavemen and other people who existed before the advent of table manners, but if your uncle speaks grunts and chews with his mouth open, you could describe him as primitive too.</li><li>Primitive is related to the word prime, and the root of both words is primus, which is Latin for ""first."" Since the phrase ""primitive man"" refers to the world's first people, you might think that the word primate has something to do with the similarity between early humans and monkeys, but it doesn't.  Monkey, apes, and humans are called primates because they're seen as standing on the first, or highest, rung of the animal-kingdom ladder.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3254,"<ul><li>A stereotype is a preconceived notion, especially about a group of people. Many stereotypes are rooted in prejudice — so you should be wary of them.</li><li>You have probably heard stereotypes: commonly held ideas or preconceptions about specific groups. You most often hear about negative stereotypes, but some are positive — the stereotype that tall people are good at basketball, for example. One of many problems with any stereotype is that even if it's true in some cases, it's certainly not true in all cases.</li></ul>"

Yuck.</li><li>Many things are meant to be sticky, like the sticky notes you use for bookmarks or the sticky lint roller you use to remove cat hair from your pants. You can also describe hot, humid weather as sticky, or an awkward problem you can't easily shake: ""They brought up a number of sticky issues in the meeting this morning."" If someone has ""sticky fingers,"" it means they're inclined to steal things.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3256,"<ul><li>A termite is a tiny insect that can cause big problems. Termites eat wood, and they can severely damage buildings. If you have termites in your house, you'd better call an exterminator.</li><li>Termites live in large colonies, like ants, and they have a habit of remaining concealed from view. These characteristics, along with their taste for wood, mean they often destroy wooden houses or other structures from the inside, leaving a thin layer of wood that hides the destruction until it's too late to stop it. In some places, it's common for people to eat termites.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3257,"<ul><li>The adverb thereby shows cause and effect: ""She forgot to tie her shoes, thereby tripping and falling down the stairs.""</li><li>Use thereby to connect two events: because of  A, B happened: ""Matt walked around with the frying pan on his head, thereby causing him to walk into a wall.""  Thereby is used in the infamous saying, written by Shakespeare: ""And thereby hangs a tale"" — a humorous way to let your listeners know they are about to hear an extremely long explanation as to why something happened.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U13_3258,"<ul><li>A trail is an unpaved path, like the narrow trail you follow through the woods on your hike. A trail can also be a series of clues that are left behind, also forming a kind of path.</li><li>You can walk along a trail, and you can also follow a trail: ""My little brother left a trail of cracker crumbs behind him, so I found him right away."" When you trail, you move slowly behind something or someone, or you drag something on the ground: ""She sadly trails her deflated balloon behind her."" You also might trail someone you're chasing: ""My dog likes to trail squirrels around the yard.""</li></ul>"

Parents are usually in charge of their children's welfare, making sure they're healthy, happy and well fed.</li><li>Welfare is a state of content or prosperous existence. So if something bad happens, your welfare is threatened. Welfare can also refer to a government system designed to give money, food, and resources to the poor. Welfare systems have been around since ancient Roman times, but the U.S. welfare program didn't start until the 1930's, during the Great Depression.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3261,"<ul><li>Behalf means speaking or acting for someone. A parent can sign forms on behalf of children when they are young, but adult children can sign on behalf of their aging parents.</li><li>Some people make a distinction between the meaning of the word behalf when paired with in versus on. In behalf, they argue, is used when the meaning is in the interest of someone else, but on behalf is used when speaking for someone. For example, a medical decision would be made in behalf of the patient, and you would speak on behalf of your family. The reality is that on behalf is typically used for both meanings.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3262,"<ul><li>You're probably familiar with the verb to ""flap,"" which is what birds do with their wings. But as a noun, a flap is a fuss, an argument, or a gossipy feud.</li><li>A big part of the pleasure of reality TV shows is watching how quickly a person can start a flap. A dumb remark, a furtive glance, a missed phone call: any of these things can start the characters bickering. And the flap can go on for an entire season! One way to remember the meaning of the verb to flap is to imagine the sound of many wings flapping. That's the sound a flap might make if you could hear it. The leak from the senator's press agent might have caused a firestorm. Instead it resulted in just a minor flap.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3263,"<ul><li>A glacier is a very large ice mass, sometimes miles and miles long. Glaciers might not seem all that exciting at first, but people are paying close attention to them because their melting is an indication of climate change.</li><li>Most glaciers on Earth are found around the North and South poles, but every continent except for Australia has glaciers somewhere in its high mountain ranges. People often want to go see glaciers because they're beautiful, and some you can actually hike across. Luckily, if you get thirsty glaciers are the planet’s largest reservoir of freshwater. You’ll just have to find some way of melting them . . .</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3264,"<ul><li>A globe doesn't have to be a spherical representation of our planet; it can be anything shaped like one — like a soccer ball or a gumball.</li><li>Referring to a round shape, globe is often used interchangeably with sphere, though sphere has another meaning of an area of particular interest or a segment of a particular population. Globe is also another name for planet Earth itself, our lovely third rock from the sun — as in ""viewers are tuning in from around the globe.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3265,"<ul><li>The opposite of vertical, something horizontal is arranged sideways, like a person lying down.</li><li>When you sleep (unless you're a horse), your body is horizontal: horizontal things are parallel to the ground or running in the same direction as the horizon. If you stack books horizontally, then they're on their side. You hear a lot about horizontal lines in geometry: If you picture a square, the top and bottom lines are horizontal lines.</li></ul>"

Otherwise you'll end up with more jars of mustard that you don't need.</li><li>The noun form of inventory developed in the early 15th century from the Middle French inventaire, meaning “detailed list of goods.” It's most commonly used in retail: a shop's inventory is everything that they have in stock, ready to sell. You can also use inventory as a verb when you want to describe the act of listing out the merchandise or supplies you have on hand.</li></ul>"

The kitchen smells great — it must be time to pull that loaf of sourdough out of the oven!</li><li>If you're a lazy lover of baked goods, your dream vacation might look like this: the chance to loaf around eating one fresh-baked loaf of bread after another. The verb loaf means ""laze around doing nothing,"" but its origin remains a mystery to word experts — although you might look like a bit like a loaf of bread you loaf on the sofa covered in blankets.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3270,"<ul><li>Back in ancient times, an oracle was someone who offered advice or a prophecy thought to have come directly from a divine source. In modern usage, any good source of information can be called an oracle.</li><li>In his Apology, Plato claims that the oracle at Delphi played a vital role in the career of the philosopher Socrates, and a Delphic prophecy sets the tragedy of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex in motion. The word oracle can also be used to describe the utterances of a seer or anyone else who is pretty darn good at predicting the future.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3271,"<ul><li>To orbit is to follow a circular or elliptical path around a central body.  Usually a planet, moon or satellite is described as orbiting, but a child who has too much sugar can sometimes orbit around his parents in an annoying fashion.</li><li>Orbit comes from the Latin orbita, “course,” or “track.”  The verb orbit is the act of revolving around another object, usually on a circular or elliptical course. Many planets, moons, stars, meteors spacecraft and other objects in outer space orbit around each other. Electrons also orbit around the nucleus of an atom. The noun orbit is the path the object in orbit takes: ""The Earth’s orbit around the Sun takes one year to complete.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3272,"<ul><li>An overview is a general summary of something. An overview gives the big picture, while leaving out the minor details.</li><li>If you take a class on American history, the class will be an overview: it will sum up the most important events that have happened, such as famous elections, national disasters, major wars, and economic trends. When writing an overview, you have to leave out a lot of details, because you're focusing on major points. You can give an overview of a company's business, of a sport team's season, or even of your own life.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3273,"<ul><li>A preview gives you a look at something that hasn't been released yet. You see lots of previews at the movies.</li><li>If you've been to a movie lately, chances are you saw plenty of previews — little highlights of upcoming movies that are designed to make you want to see them. Any little snippet designed to get you excited about something to come can be called a preview. If you're writing a novel, you could give someone a preview by reading them a few lines. And you're lucky enough to see a show before it opens to the public, you're previewing it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3274,"<ul><li>Previous means the one that just came before. For instance, the previous sentence explained the meaning of the word previous.</li><li>With previous, you first see that the prefix pre meaning ""before."" The second part of the word, vius, — think via — means ""road,"" so you’re talking about the road, or thing, before. Previous, though, can be used with people, or anything else too. You will know right away if the previous tenants had cats. Do you ever wonder what you were in a previous life? Rivers are at flood stage from the previous two rain storms.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3275,"<ul><li>To provide means to give or supply. When you stay in a bed and breakfast, the innkeeper will generally provide you with a meal in the morning as part of the price of the room.</li><li>The verb provide generally means to make available or even to allow. The Constitution, for example, provides for protected freedom of speech. But you've probably also heard people talking about getting a job to provide for their family — in that case, to provide means to make money to pay for food and bills, or in other words, bring home the bacon.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3276,"<ul><li>Have you ever had the same crazy dream night after night? If so, you know that dreams can recur, meaning they repeat, or happen again.</li><li>The verb recur is used to describe something that happens over and over, whether it’s an injury, an argument, or a character who pops up from time to time on a television show. Recur often describes an event that happens repeatedly, but it can also be used to describe something, such as an image or a memory, that for some reason just keeps popping back up in your mind, like self-doubt that recurs every time you worry about something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3277,"<ul><li>Something is relevant if it's appropriate or connected to the matter at hand. Relevant things are helpful and on point.</li><li>Relevant things are appropriate and make sense at that particular time. In the middle of history class, your teacher loves to get relevant questions: questions that have to do with the material. The teacher won't be thrilled to get a question about math: that's not relevant. You can also say a song or movie is relevant if it's connected to current events or issues people are talking about. When something is relevant, it just fits what is happening.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3278,"<ul><li>A rite is a ceremony or event that leads to a new phase of life, like high school graduation or a bat mitzvah.</li><li>Rites are rituals. Religions in particular have many rites, which include celebrations and sacraments such as baptism or confession. But people also use this word for any kind of event that signifies moving through a stage of life. For a football player, getting your first touchdown is a ""rite of passage."" Even a job interview could be considered a rite — it's a traditional ritual, something everyone has to go through before landing a first job.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3279,"<ul><li>Stall means to stop or delay. If your car stalls, it comes to a stop. When you want a horse to stop, you put him in a stall, or small enclosure inside a barn.</li><li>The word stall implies stopping something that will start again — a horse will leave the stall eventually and start moving, a stalled car can be restarted. Remember that when you're thinking about stall in the sense of postpone or delay. You can stall your professor from giving an exam by talking about last night’s big game. Your little sister can stall going to bed by asking for one more story. If you want to delay an approaching army, you might steal their boots — they'll still come but the ""stall tactic"" will buy you time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U14_3280,"<ul><li>If you enjoy a good story about vampires, witches, werewolves, or ghosts, you like reading about the supernatural — forces, beings, and events that are beyond what can be explained by nature.</li><li>Supernatural comes from the Latin word supernaturalis, meaning beyond nature. The adjective form of supernatural describes anything that pertains to or is caused by something that can't be explained by the laws of nature. It's interesting to ask your friends what kind of supernatural power they would choose to have. Most will probably wish for the ability to fly, though some will pick the supernatural power of being invisible.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3281,"<ul><li>Aquarium can either describe a small tank, or an entire building that houses fish and other aquatic life. Your goldfish will probably feel right at home in the aquarium that's sitting on your desk, but a whale would be better off in a big aquarium where people buy tickets to see marine life.</li><li>An aquarium can be small enough to fit in the average house, or big enough to house whales and accommodate millions of tourists each year. If you're talking about more than one of those tanks filled with fish and other marine life, you could say aquariums, but aquaria, from the original Latin term, is also an acceptable plural.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3282,"<ul><li>Something that's arbitrary seems like it's chosen at random instead of following a consistent rule. Team members would dislike their coach using a totally arbitrary method to pick starting players.</li><li>Even though arbitrary comes from a word meaning ""judge"" (arbiter), that doesn't mean judges are always fair. Calling a decision-maker arbitrary is usually a negative thing, suggesting the person is making rules based on whim rather than justice. A coach who selects starting players arbitrarily isn't strictly applying a rule; he could just be picking names out of a hat.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3283,"<ul><li>You are writing an autobiography when you write your own life story. A writer who writes an autobiography is like a painter who paints a self-portrait.</li><li>If you intend to write your autobiography one day, it might be a good idea to start recording notes about your life in a diary. The author Gertrude Stein was being clever when she poked fun at the very idea of autobiography when she wrote her own memoirs but titled them The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, instead of The Autobiography of Gertrude Stein.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3284,"<ul><li>A convention is a meeting, usually of a particular group. Political parties, teachers, plumbers, gardeners, toymakers and computer designers all hold conventions.</li><li>In fact, lots of cities have built Convention Centers in hopes of attracting convention-goers. The best-known conventions happen every four years when the Democrats and Republicans meet to nominate presidential candidates. A convention can also be used to describe the normal or accepted way of doing things. It's the convention, for example, for your employer to give you a three-day weekend around the Fourth of July, even if it falls on a weekend.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3285,"<ul><li>Gracious means ""kind, courteous, and compassionate,"" like your gracious reply to a rude question like, ""So, did you ever learn to hit a softball?""</li><li>Gracious descends from the Latin word for good will. A gracious person wants everyone to be comfortable: a gracious host leaves extra blankets and some books on a variety of subjects out for overnight guests to enjoy. Even at a difficult moment, a gracious person remains thoughtful and kind, like the gracious way you treat a waiter who spills a glass of juice on your lap.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3286,"<ul><li>When you improve something, you make it better. For example, you can improve your harmonica playing with practice.</li><li>Be happy when you see this word, because something is getting better — improving. Getting a tutor will usually improve your grades. Sleeping well improves your health and alertness. A haircut could improve your looks. Painters have to decide whether a painting is finished or if it can still be improved. Voters decide which candidate will improve the nation. Sometimes a sick patient will mysteriously improve. The opposite of improve is worsen or deteriorate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3287,"<ul><li>The verb insulate means ""protect from heat, cold, or noise,"" like when you add an extra layer of clothing to insulate yourself from the cold.</li><li>You can insulate a wall to keep sound out, or insulate your house to keep cold air from getting inside. So, to insulate is to protect against unwanted changes. Sometimes this can mean keeping out the influence or beliefs of other people, like a parent who tries to insulate his children from people who have different cultures or beliefs. You can see this meaning in the origin of insulate: the Latin word insula, meaning “to make into an island.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3288,"<ul><li>An intrigue is a secret plot. If you ever become the monarch of a small island kingdom, keep watch for signs of any intrigue against you.</li><li>Intrigue comes from the Latin verb intricare,  to entangle, and is related to intricate. It can be a noun, meaning underhanded plot, or a verb for the act of plotting. Agents of two opposing powers intrigue against each other. In the late nineteenth century it also came to mean the feeling of curiosity or interest. If someone's ideas intrigue you, you want to know more about them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3289,"<ul><li>Something with longevity has the ability to last for a long time. While tortoises are not known for their quickness, their longevity is amazing. Just ask the Hare.</li><li>At the root of longevity is the word long. So when you see longevity, think “a long time."" In fact, this word has some serious longevity, since it's been around since the 1600s. Longevity is most commonly used to describe the length of one’s lifetime, but it can also mean a long duration, such as one’s longevity working for a certain company for an extended period of time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3290,"<ul><li>When you misplace your car keys, you can't remember where you put them. In other words, you temporarily lose them.</li><li>You can use the verb misplace when you can't find something. If you misplace your favorite coffee cup, you'll be annoyed, but if you misplace your wallet it could cause you real problems. The word implies that the object isn't gone for good, but that you unthinkingly put it down somewhere. When you combine the prefix mis-, which means ""bad or wrong,"" and place, you get misplace — as in placing something in a bad spot!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3291,"<ul><li>Naughty describes someone — or someone’s pet — who is disobedient, bad, rascally, or otherwise poorly behaved.</li><li>You might remember the word naughty by the way it sounds; think of it as containing the sound ""not"" as in ""Naughty is what you get called when you get caught doing something you were NOT supposed to do!""
While naughtiness may be in the eye of the beholder, every human culture seems to have its own version of naughty.  For instance, those who celebrate Christmas and want to be on Santa’s “nice” list better avoid any naughty behaviors!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3292,"<ul><li>A statistical average is called the norm. If you live in a town made up mostly of farmers but your trade is basket weaving, then you're outside the norm.</li><li>The noun norm is from the Latin word norma, which was a carpenter's square or pattern used in construction to make regular corners. Now we use norm for anything that sets a standard. You can score within the norm on a standardized test, score above the norm on an IQ test, or fall below the norm in acceptable standards of dress if you wear a halter top and cut-off jeans to a formal ball.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3293,"<ul><li>Orangutans are primates with red fur, and they're also the largest animals that live mostly in trees. You may have seen orangutans at the zoo, swinging from branch to branch using their long arms.</li><li>Orangutans are distinctive animals, with their shaggy hair, short legs, and long, agile arms. These intelligent primates are native to Indonesian and Malaysian rainforests, and just like those ecosystems, orangutans are endangered. Their name is derived from the Malay orang utan, ""man of the forest,"" and it's especially fitting that we now know orangutans share more than 96 percent of their genes with humans.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3294,"<ul><li>To overload is to load an excessive amount in or on something, such as an overload of electricity which shorts out the circuits. Overloading causes a ""Too much!"" situation.</li><li>To overload is to push something or someone too far. A supervisor can overload an employee by assigning too much work. People can overload a bus if there are too many of them. A fuse will blow if too many appliances overload the circuits; this is called an overload (the noun form). When something gets overloaded, it usually stops working. Hair can overload or clog a sink, which will stop draining water. When something gets overloaded, there's more of something than it can handle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3295,"<ul><li>If you donate money to a charity or volunteer to help people in need, you can call your good deeds philanthropy.</li><li>Philanthropy is made up of two parts — Greek phil, ""loving"" and anthrop, ""mankind."" It refers to the desire to help people or the actual deeds a person does to benefit mankind. Philanthropy most often refers to the large amounts of money the wealthy donate to causes such as world hunger or organizations like museums or animal shelters. A private organization that promotes the welfare of people can also be called a philanthropy.</li></ul>"

If you go into business with someone, you might probe her finances to make sure that she has a good track record.</li><li>Although it is usually used as a verb — ""the police probed the man’s disappearance"" — it can also be used as a noun to describe an information-gathering device. In 1979 the United States launched the world's first space probe into outer space.  It was a spacecraft rigged with cameras, which were used to photograph Jupiter and Saturn.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3297,"<ul><li>A recipient is the person on the receiving end of something. Meryl Streep is the recipient of more Academy Award nominations than any other actor.</li><li>Just as an actor can be the recipient of a prize for acting, a banker can be the recipient of a bonus for good banking. You'll notice the connection between recipient and receive. In order to be a recipient you have to receive something, whether it's a prize or just a letter in the mail.

If it's true that it's better to give than to receive, does that mean it's better to be a giver than a recipient?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3298,"<ul><li>A reptile is one of those mostly scaly and slimy animals that are cold-blooded and have backbones. Lizards and turtles? Yep — both reptiles. Puppies and kittens? No way.</li><li>There are many classes of animals. People are part of the mammal class. Another class is reptiles, which are all cold-blooded vertebrates (meaning they have backbones). Snakes, turtles, tortoises, lizards, alligators, chameleons, geckos, skinks, and crocodiles are all reptiles. You'll see plenty of reptiles at the zoo, and you'll see replicas of some at a natural history museum — since dinosaurs were reptiles!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3299,"<ul><li>To thrive is to do well or flourish. If your new cookie delivery business thrives, you'll be rolling in dough — not literally, of course.</li><li>The verb thrive means to flourish or grow vigorously, and it can be applied to something like a business or to the health of someone or something. Plants can thrive in a greenhouse, and children can thrive if they eat well and exercise. To thrive on or in something can also be used more figuratively — people can thrive on music, listening to their favorite songs all day and others can thrive on art, visiting their favorite galleries and museums.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U15_3300,"<ul><li>The last in a series can be described as the ultimate. A cheeky kid, when asked what she wants to be when she grows up, might say, ""I want to be an actress, a singer, and a veterinarian, but my ultimate goal is to be President of the United States.""</li><li>A definition for the adjective ultimate is the furthest in space or time or the highest in degree or order. Traveling for business, you are flying first to London, then to Portugal, but your ultimate destination is South Africa. The kids ask you if they can invite friends over to play video games. It's a good idea to reply, ""Mom isn't home from work yet and she's ultimate authority on the schedule.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3301,"<ul><li>An antique is an old-fashioned thing, like a lamp from the sixties. Anything antique is old or at least old-ish.</li><li>When you see the word antique, you know you're not going to hear about anything new or young. An antique is a nice, old piece of furniture, that's usually been well taken care of and costs more than something new. Shopping for antiques is called antiquing. Outside of antique shops, calling anything antique means it's out-of-date and useless — so if you wanted to be mean, you could call your grandparents antiques.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3302,"<ul><li>An applicant is someone who signs up or applies for something. A job applicant for example, often fills out a form and then interviews for the position she hopes to get.</li><li>When you submit your college application to a school you'd like to attend, you are an applicant to that school. Other kinds of applicants are job candidates and scholarship hopefuls. To apply is to put in for or request entry to something, and the root of both apply and applicant is the Old French aploiier, ""apply, use, or attach,"" from the Latin applicare, ""attach to, join, or connect.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3303,"<ul><li>An artifact is a man-made object that has some kind of cultural significance. If you find a 12th-century vase, it's an artifact of that time. Don't drop it!</li><li>Artifact is a combination of two Latin words, arte, meaning ""by skill"" and factum which means ""to make."" Usually when you use the word artifact, you are describing something crafted that was used for a particular purpose during a much earlier time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3304,"<ul><li>The adjective authentic describes something that is real or genuine and not counterfeit. Be careful when you are buying jewelry or watches. If you are going to buy a diamond ring, you want an authentic diamond and not glass. That would be authentic glass but a fake diamond!</li><li>In addition to describing something real, the adjective authentic describes something reliable, based on fact, and believable. If you have to write a research paper for school, be sure to use authentic facts and figures. The teacher is sure to check if you write, ""My little sister told me that the Eiffel Tower is about 10,000 feet high,"" when in fact it's 1,063 feet tall.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3305,"<ul><li>A chronology is like a timeline: it tells what happened when.  A chronology of your day would begin when you wake up and end when you go to sleep.  Hopefully, something interesting happened in between.</li><li>Khronos is the Greek word for ""time"" and that's where chronology comes from.   If a movie has a lot of flashbacks or doesn't tell a story straight through from beginning to end, you might have to give it some thought in order to put together a chronology of events.  If you are a detective, a correct chronology could be important to solving your case.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3306,"<ul><li>A diplomat is a person who helps people who have differing points of view find common ground. In government, a diplomat is an official who represents his or her country in other nations.</li><li>The noun diplomat is related to the word diploma, from the Greek diploun, meaning “to fold double.” A diploma is an official paper — something diplomats carry on behalf of their governments. They know about all sides of an issue, which is helpful in times of conflict. You are a diplomat, if caught between Yankees and Red Sox fans, you get them to talk about hockey instead.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3307,"<ul><li>An epic is a long poem or other work of art celebrating heroic feats. After you sail around the world for seven years, fighting corruption and planting vegetable gardens, some poet will surely write the epic of your adventures.</li><li>Epic comes from the Greek word for song, because Greek poets like Homer sang their poems. We tend to use epic for long, ambitious novels or movies, especially if they involve a long journey. Epic can be used as an adjective to describe something historically important, lasting and complex. Perhaps your great-grandfather was a soldier in the epic struggle of World War One. Your three day, sleepless card poker game could be described as epic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3308,"<ul><li>Instead of sharing all 147 lines of your favorite poem in class, you might want to read an excerpt, that is, just a part of the verses, so no one dozes off.</li><li>Excerpt sounds a lot like ""except"" with an added ""r,"" and it came into English in the 16th century from a Latin word meaning ""plucked out."" When the word is used as a verb, excerpt means to take a portion out, usually from a play, book, article, song, or other written work. And the part that is taken out also is called an excerpt, but it is a noun, that is, a thing. An excerpt is something you excerpt, or pluck out, from a larger piece.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3309,"<ul><li>Fossils are the really, really old remains of a plant or animal — so old they've turned to stone. Fossil is also an insult for an old or old-fashioned person.</li><li>Fossils are very important to scientists who study animals: they're one of the ways we learn about the beasts and critters of the past. A fossil is an imprint of the bones of that animal in rock or stone. If you see a reconstruction of a dinosaur in a museum, scientists used fossils to figure out how it should look. Also, calling someone a fossil is like calling them a geezer or old fogey. It's not a compliment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3310,"<ul><li>Humiliate means to make someone feel ashamed or stupid, often publicly. It would humiliate all but the most self-assured person to realize that everyone else in the room has noticed their fly is down.</li><li>For many, the experience of high school seems designed to humiliate teens––under the microscope of public scrutiny that is the high school community, every break up, every bad-hair day, every forgotten homework assignment humiliates kids in ways adults rarely understand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3311,"<ul><li>The word lyric claims its emotional place in music and poetry, with the words to a song being called the lyrics, while a lyric poem is one steeped in personal emotions, making it song-like.</li><li>As with many artistic terms, the word lyric derives from the Greek, specifically from  lyrikós, meaning ""singing to the lyre,"" and today’s meanings are also rooted in the idea of music. The lyric poem was first seen in the late 16th Century, while the reference to a song’s words as lyrics appeared in 1876.  If every one of your poems starts with the word ""I,"" you might be a lyric poet.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3312,"<ul><li>Majesty describes a quality that takes your breath away, it's so impressive. The Grand Canyon has it, and so does a British monarch (supposedly).</li><li>The word majesty brings to mind a luxurious castle, which is appropriate because it is also used to address or refer to a king or queen. The Latin root word is maiestatem, which means ""greatness, dignity, or excellence,"" and people first used the noun majesty to talk about God. It was England's King Henry VIII who decided that majesty would be the official way to address a British monarch.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3313,"<ul><li>If you think the Queen of England is just the coolest thing ever, then you like monarchs: hereditary rulers of countries usually known as king or queen.</li><li>You might think your principal rules with absolute power, but that's not really true: there's a school board and an administration and she can't really control everything. But a monarch can. Monarch comes from the Greek mono, ""one,"" and archon, ""ruler."" Many modern monarchies actually have parliaments and constitutions, leaving the monarch more symbolic than powerful. A monarch is also a particularly royal looking butterfly with orange wings and black and white spots.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3314,"<ul><li>To precede is to come before. A short speech will precede the dinner. As you walk down the garden path, the bed of roses precedes the holly bush. When marching into the room, the younger kids precede the older ones.</li><li>Precede is one of many verbs ending in ""-ceed"" or ""-cede"" that trace their roots back to the Latin word cedere which means ""to go."" For precede, know that it's pre ""first"" + cedere ""go."" When you precede, you go first. You might precede your best friend in line, lunch might precede math class, a joke might precede a lecture, and radio preceded television. Anything that goes first or comes before precedes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3315,"<ul><li>When someone says “Be punctual,” that means you better be there on time. Five minutes late won’t cut it.</li><li>Some people seem to follow an appointment clock instinctively. We call those types punctual. They'll check their watch when you arrive three minutes late. The word punctual originates from the Latin word punctualis, which means “a point.” To be punctual, you have to arrive at the right point in time. For your appointment. Get the point?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3316,"<ul><li>To recruit means to get someone to join something. You might recruit people for the navy or you might recruit members for your quilting group.</li><li>The verb recruit often refers to formally joining an organization or a group, such as the military or a corporation. It can also be used more broadly to refer to getting someone to participate in a cause, formal or otherwise, like when you recruit your friend to help paint your room. As a noun, recruit means ""a person who has been recruited."" If you just joined the Army, you're a new recruit.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3317,"<ul><li>To refund is to give money back, especially when someone isn't satisfied with an item they bought or the service they got. If you complain that your restaurant food is undercooked, the manager may refund your money.</li><li>When you don't actually get what you paid for, you deserve a refund, or a repayment of the money you spent. Most businesses will refund money to unhappy customers, and when you return something — like a pair of pants that doesn't fit — you'll also get a refund. The verb came before the noun, and it originally meant ""to pour back,"" from the Latin root fundere, ""to pour.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3318,"<ul><li>Register has several meanings, but one of the most common is to write down or record officially. Like registering your car with the DMV and registering for classes at the beginning of a semester.</li><li>Someone needs to register all the ways you can use the word register: As a noun it means the actual book that you record things in. But a register is also the range of sound your voice can make, and that thing the checkout lady uses to ring up your grocery bill. As a verb, register means to mark down officially or sign up, but also to show emotion: if cats and dogs rain from the sky, your face will likely register a look of disbelief.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3319,"<ul><li>Renown is fame and acclaim — the kind of celebrity that most people only dream about. Renown is not only about celebrity, though; it also means being highly respected in one's field.</li><li>Actors, musicians, and artists practice their art, sometimes for many years, to gain the kind of renown, or fame, that will launch their faces onto the covers of magazines and make their name known in every household. Greta Garbo, Luciano Pavarotti, and Salvador Dali all became renowned in their respective fields. They won numerous awards, and who isn't familiar with their names? Even things or places can achieve renown if they offer something worth celebrating. An ice cream parlor can become renowned for its incredible mint chip ice cream, or a bank can be renowned for its excellent customer service.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U16_3320,"<ul><li>A tusk is the long, pointed tooth seen on some animals, such as elephants, walruses, or hogs. Animals that have tusks can use them for protection against predators.</li><li>Tusk rhymes with dusk. A tusk is a tooth that grows outward from an animal's mouth. How is a tusk different from a fang? Fangs are used to seize prey and bite and tear. Tusks, on the other hand, are used for defense and even as tools for digging or, in the cause of the walrus, for holding steady while on ice.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3321,"<ul><li>To coexist is to live in the same place or at the same time. If you, your roommate, and a cat all live in an apartment together, you can say the three of you coexist.</li><li>You can use the verb coexist to simply mean ""exist together,"" or it can mean something more specific — to live peacefully or tolerantly in the same place. Two countries might have to work to find a way to coexist despite years of conflict, for example. The word has been around since the 1600's, but it wasn't used in this second, diplomatic way until 1931. Coexist combines exist, ""be"" or ""live,"" with the prefix co, ""together.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3322,"<ul><li>To conceive is to come up with an idea. If you conceive a plan for your little brother's birthday, you dream up the perfect party, complete with a magician, rented ponies, and a cake shaped like a rocket.</li><li>Latin roots for conceive (by way of French) point to ""take into"" either ""the womb"" or ""the mind."" An idea is sometimes called ""a seed"" or ""the seed of an idea,"" and conceive means to produce something from inside the mind — or to become pregnant. Another expression is ""pregnant with ideas"" or ""pregnant with possibilities,"" and someone who can ""conceive of a thousand ways"" to solve a problem or design something is full of new ideas.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3323,"<ul><li>Choose the adjective dubious for something you have doubts about or you suspect is not true. That bridge you just ""bought"" might be of dubious value.</li><li>Dubious stems from Latin dubiosus, ""doubtful"" or ""uncertain,"" and contains the Latin root duo in this case meaning ""of two minds."" This is apparent in that dubious generally describes something that appears one way but is truly another. A dubious claim is probably not true, whereas a dubious website or character is of questionable quality. Dubious can also be synonymous with doubtful, as in ""she was dubious about the idea.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3324,"<ul><li>Your ego is your conscious mind, the part of your identity that you consider your ""self."" If you say someone has ""a big ego,"" then you are saying he is too full of himself.</li><li>Poor ego, it gets such a bad rap, being so often confused with ""megalomania"" and ""vanity"" and all kinds of other nasty things, but strictly speaking it is only a psychological term popularized by Freud meaning the conscious (as opposed to the unconscious) mind, or the awareness of one's own identity and existence. Nothing wrong in that, is there?</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3325,"<ul><li>Elastic is the rubber-based material that resumes its original shape after stretching or compression, and anything described as elastic is flexible.</li><li>In 1923 American inventor William H Spencer took elastic one step further, creating the elastic band — the Internet of its day for bored office workers seeking amusement. The properties of elastic have long lent themselves to metaphorical use, so that anything or anyone that's capable of adaptation or is flexible in its nature can be termed elastic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3326,"<ul><li>When you endeavor to do something, you try hard to make it happen. A determined student might endeavor to get straight As on her report card.</li><li>""The ordinary objects of human endeavor — property, outward success, luxury — have always seemed to me contemptible,"" wrote Albert Einstein. Presumably, NASA had loftier objects in mind when they named one of their space shuttles Endeavour, using the British spelling. The word comes from the Old French phrase mettre en deveir, or ""put in duty."" As a verb, it's a more impressive word than try and suggests you're doing your darnedest to make something happen.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3327,"<ul><li>To engrave is to carve into something, especially stone. Sometimes people have messages engraved inside their wedding rings, their iPods, or any other rock-hard surface that can handle it.</li><li>Words are engraved on tombstones to honor the people who died. Grave used to mean “to dig or carve” but no one uses it that way anymore because they would say engrave instead. Anytime a hard surface has a message or picture cut into, it was engraved. Sometimes engraving isn’t physical. A super fun birthday when your long lost grandmother rode in on a stallion could be engraved in your mind forever. Both kinds of engraving leave an impression.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3328,"<ul><li>To excavate is to remove or find by digging. If you have rocky soil in your garden, you may have to excavate it to remove the rocks and replace them with additional soil.</li><li>Construction crews also excavate when they remove material from the ground. Workers slowly excavate subways tunnels using explosives to break up the rock and earth. Then the workers clear away the materials, hollowing out a tunnel as they go. It often takes a lot of time and effort to excavate. But most people would agree a new subway line is dynamite!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3329,"<ul><li>Something is jagged when it has an uneven edge or quality to it. Teeth can be jagged, saw blades can be jagged, and the edges of leaves can be jagged.</li><li>Jagged comes from 16th century English/Scottish and originally referred to a cloth, cut in a way so that the edge is not straight, but that is “toothed.” Imagine a tipsy seamstress trying to cut cloth in a straight line, but her sheers stray this way then that. She’s leaving a jagged edge on the cloth. Or perhaps you have a crush on the seamstress, but she is seen kissing another. Here, she’s leaving a jagged wound on your heart.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3330,"<ul><li>A locale is the specific place where something happens. If you dream of a trip to some tropical locale, Hawaii, Belize, and Costa Rica might all be on your wish list.</li><li>When you choose a locale for a big sci-fi convention, you need to make sure there's enough room for all the participants. And when you decide on a locale for an intimate party, you might stick to a cozy spot like your own living room. Locale comes from the French local, and it was originally spelled the same way. The e was eventually added to encourage correct pronunciation, with the emphasis on the last syllable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3331,"<ul><li>Earthquakes have great magnitude in that they are powerful. Their power is rated by their level of magnitude, or how much energy they release relative to other earthquakes.</li><li>In math, magnitude compares numbers by powers of 10. If your weekly allowance was $10, but your brother's was $100, his allowance would be one order of magnitude higher than yours. If your sister's was $10,000, hers would be three orders of magnitude higher. A difference of that magnitude is just not fair!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3332,"<ul><li>That green fungus growing on your bread is called mold — use it as a science experiment if you want to, but you definitely shouldn't plan on eating it. Mold grows where there is damp, decaying organic matter.</li><li>A mold is also a container that certain foods or materials — like gelatin, chocolate, wax or concrete — can be poured into. When the food or material sets, it will keep the shape of the mold. If you pour red and blue gelatin into molds shaped like stars, you'll have a great patriotic dessert for the Fourth of July. As a verb, mold can mean to influence. Good teachers mold their students' interests and passions.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3333,"<ul><li>If you do something outright, you do it in a wholehearted, unrestricted way. If you declare outright that you’re never eating another cupcake, that’s the end of that. If you eat one anyway, you told an outright lie.</li><li>If an event is cancelled outright, there's no question about it being rescheduled, and if you buy a new car outright, you pay for it all at once, instead of making monthly payments. Outright means direct and immediate — whether it's an adverb or an adjective: ""The child's outright refusal to put on his shoes exasperated his babysitter."" It can also mean “right away.” If you step on a slug, you’ll probably kill it outright. Ew.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3334,"<ul><li>When something is on the periphery of your vision, you can only see it when you’re looking sideways. Periphery means outside the boundary of something.</li><li>If you’re on the periphery of a group, you’re close to it but not part of it. A band on the periphery of a particular scene might have opened for another band a few times, but it's never headlined or gotten their big break. Periphery comes from a Greek word meaning ""to carry around.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3335,"<ul><li>Plaster is a building material that's applied as a wet paste and dries very hard and smooth. The walls inside your house might be made of plaster.</li><li>New houses typically have interior walls made of drywall, rather than plaster, but older homes usually have many plaster surfaces. Plaster starts as a mixture of lime, gypsum, sand, or cement that's mixed with water. This soft substance is applied to surfaces where it hardens — either for walls, works of art, or as casts used to hold broken bones steady. In Britain, a plaster is also a sticky bandage, while an American would call this a Band-Aid.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3336,"<ul><li>A shovel is the tool you need if you want to dig holes in the ground. If you're taking your younger cousins to the beach, be sure to bring lots of pails and shovels so they can build a sandcastle.</li><li>A shovel has a long handle and a wide, curved blade at the end. By pushing the end of the shovel into the ground and scooping, you can shovel out enough soil to make room for the treasure chest you want to bury. Shovels are useful for clearing snow from sidewalks and driveways too, and you can describe the amount of dirt carried in a shovel as a shovel (or shovelful) of dirt.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3337,"<ul><li>Use the adjective skeletal to describe anything that relates to a skeleton or anything without a lot of ""flesh,"" like the skeletal remains of a bird or the skeletal outline of a paper that is missing all the details.</li><li>If you're a scientist or a doctor, you may use the word skeletal mostly to talk about skeletons, but it also describes someone who is dangerously thin. A skeletal stray dog has probably been living on the streets for a long time. This word is also used figuratively to describe something that has not yet been ""fleshed out"" — like a skeletal staff or crew that operates without a lot of support. The root of skeletal is the Greek skeleton, ""dried-up body, mummy, or skeleton.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3338,"<ul><li>To stumble means to nearly fall by tripping or missing a step. When you walk over uneven cobblestones, it’s easy to stumble, so please be careful.</li><li>While stumble often means to nearly fall, it can also mean to make a misstep of a different kind. If you stumble over your words, you speak in a stuttering confused manner. Politicians make so many public decisions that they're bound to stumble — make a mistake — occasionally. When you stumble on rare mushrooms, i.e. come across them unexpectedly, be sure have the species verified before you eat them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3339,"<ul><li>Your thigh is the part of your leg between your hip and your knee. Your thighs are probably the strongest parts of your body.</li><li>Humans' thighs have just one extremely strong bone, the femur, and many muscles, including the hamstrings and quadriceps. Your thigh is joined to your torsos with a ball-and-socket hip joint, and to your lower leg by the hinge joint of a knee. The word thigh comes from a Germanic source that means ""the thick or fat part of the leg.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U17_3340,"<ul><li>Vicious is an adjective that means intentionally harmful or nasty. If you spread vicious rumors about a person, you're telling people things that will hurt her feelings or ruin her reputation. Cut it out!</li><li>If you're described as vicious, you're someone who does brutal things on purpose, out of ill-will towards others, like beating up defenseless puppies or poisoning the drinking water for a town. You're worse than just mean if you are vicious — in fact, you're evil! People (and puppies) will be wise to keep their distance. Other things, like gossip, animals, or cars from horror movies can be vicious, too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3341,"<ul><li>An attic is an unfinished room at the very top of a house, just below the roof. It’s often the setting for creepy stories because it’s a room people don’t go in very often.</li><li>A finished attic is extra space you can use for a playroom, bedroom, or storage area. In fiction, it’s a great place to stash crazy people. In Charlotte Bronte’s book Jane Eyre, there’s a madwoman in the attic. Some attics don't even have floors that can be walked on, though — they're just empty space at the top of a house. An attic was originally called an attic storey, from the architectural term Attic order.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3342,
4000EEW_B06_U18_3343,"<ul><li>If something is related to or benefits an individual citizen, it can be described as civic. People often say that it is your civic duty to vote.</li><li>The adjective civic comes from the Latin word civis, which was the word for a citizen of Ancient Rome. It is also a root word for ""city,"" so civic can also mean anything related to a city. In your town, civic leaders meet frequently and public input is always welcome. So if you have a grievance about a civic issue, you should attend a meeting — or drop by the diner where the mayor always eats breakfast.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3344,"<ul><li>If you’re on your way down, you’re making a descent, whether that’s as a passenger in an airplane that's landing, or if you’re tumbling down a staircase you just slipped on.</li><li>Descent comes from the verb descend — to go down. In the original Latin meaning, descent was used spatially, in reference to physical action, like going downstairs into a creepy basement. Metaphorically, though, we also use it to describe origins, especially in ancestry, when we consider ourselves descendants of our forebears.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3345,"<ul><li>Walk into the average school cafeteria at lunchtime, and you'll get a good sense of what a din is — loud, confused, continuous, generally unpleasant, and often potentially headache-inducing noise.</li><li>Who knew noise pollution was a problem in ancient times? Humans have been experiencing loud, sustained, annoying sounds for centuries, judging by the etymology of the word din. It traces its roots back to Old English dyne or dynn, which had the same meaning as din does today, only with a different pronunciation. Before that, it popped up in Old Norse as dynr and meant to ""come rumbling down"" — fitting, from the language that gave us Thor, the God of Thunder.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3346,"<ul><li>When you dissatisfy someone, you don't meet their expectations. If you promise your dad a chocolate cake for his birthday, giving him a bran muffin instead might dissatisfy him.</li><li>To satisfy someone is to fulfill what they need or hope for — and when you dissatisfy them, you fail to do that. Your final research paper might dissatisfy your history professor, and an expensive meal will dissatisfy you if you believe you could cook something even tastier at home. Dissatisfy combines dis-, ""do the opposite of,"" with satisfy, from its Latin root satisfacere, ""discharge fully"" or ""do enough.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3347,"<ul><li>If you are making a fuss, settle down! A fuss is a state of excitement, and it's usually about something not worth worrying or ""fussing"" about.</li><li>Most fusses are types of commotion. If someone makes a fuss, they're overexcited and in a tizzy over something, like someone who can't stop asking questions. Another fuss is angrier: you might say ""What's the fuss?"" if you hear two people yelling at each other. A fuss is also any kind of hubbub or whirlwind of activity, like a huge crowd swarming toward a sale. Parents tend to fuss over their children. Someone who fusses is worrying too much.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3348,"<ul><li>Movie stars look glamorous when they walk down the red carpet in their designer gowns. Glamorous means full of glamour, beauty, and excitement.</li><li>Glamorous comes from the Scottish gramarye meaning ""magic, enchantment, spell."" See a glamorous woman walking down the street and you might be captivated or enchanted by her beauty.  A person can appear or act glamorous. An event like a really over-the-top party can be glamorous. Or a lifestyle that one chooses for herself can be glamorous, full of parties and swanky events.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3349,"<ul><li>That guy over there correctly identifying the dozen spices used in the meal he's eating? He’s likely a gourmet, someone who knows a lot about fine food.</li><li>There are gourmets and then there are foodies. Both are food enthusiasts who live to eat. A gourmet, pronounced like the French word that is its double: ""gor-MAY,"" is more likely to go for the most refined dining experience, created by a chef who trained in Europe. A foodie, on the other hand, might take you to the best burrito place — because their guacamole tastes the best — then stop by the farmers' market to see if the first of the asparagus crop has arrived.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3350,"<ul><li>Hence means ""for this reason,"" or ""therefore."" One Hollywood starlet is a huge fan of tiny dogs, hence the Pomeranian puppy peeking out of her purse.</li><li>Hence not only means ""therefore."" It can also mean forward from this time. Nine months hence, a baby that has just been conceived will enter the world kicking and screaming. These days, you're more likely to hear the word hence in a movie set a hundred years ago than in casual conversation because it has a very old-fashioned ring to it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3351,"<ul><li>The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.</li><li>Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic, for things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3352,"<ul><li>A kettle is a pot made for boiling water. Most kettles are metal, with a lid and a spout. If you're in the mood for a cup of tea, it might be time to ""put the kettle on.""</li><li>You can use the word kettle to mean ""metal cooking pot,"" although it's mostly used for the kind you use to make your tea or instant soup. If you want to comment on the incredible awkwardness of a situation, you can use the colloquial phrase, ""Well, this is a fine kettle of fish,"" and if you criticize a friend for something you're also guilty of, she might say, ""That's the pot calling the kettle black!""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3353,"<ul><li>If you are discussing the duties of your minister or rabbi, you are talking about his or her ministry — the work the religious leader does in serving a congregation. The noun ministry also refers to a group of clergy.</li><li>Even if you do not lead a religious community, you can still have a ministry, as the word means to provide information or services about an organization or cause. The charity can have a ministry to serve homeless people. The noun ministry can also refer to a government department. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Ministry of Defense oversees the armed forces. A ministry can also be the building where this sort of government work occurs.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3354,"<ul><li>An ordeal is something difficult or painful to go through. Something kind of hard like taking a test can be an ordeal, but often an ordeal is a serious and long-lasting event, like an illness or tragedy.</li><li>When you go through an ordeal you have to deal with something tough. Waiting for someone you love to recover from an injury and come home from the hospital is an ordeal––for both of you––and being a victim of a crime is a different kind of ordeal. You can use this noun in an exaggerated way, too, as when you endure the long ordeal of cleaning the garage on a sunny weekend.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3355,"<ul><li>If you often freely speak your mind, people may say that you are outspoken. How people view that particular trait in you, however, will depend on whether they agree with what you have to say or not!</li><li>Use the adjective outspoken to describe someone candid and blunt, one who is direct in manner or speech. If you are an outspoken advocate for arts education in schools, you probably attend lots of school board and community meetings trying to ensure that the board does not cut music and drama from the school curriculum. If you are an outspoken critic of the way your boss does his job, you may not have yours much longer!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3356,"<ul><li>To overwork someone is to force them to work much too hard. Before working hours were regulated in the 1930s, it was more common for bosses to overwork their employees.</li><li>If your family owns a farm, you may feel that your parents overwork you all summer until you go back to school in the fall — but there are much more serious cases of employers who overwork their laborers in countries where things like work hours and minimum wage aren't mandated by law. You can use overwork as a noun, too, to mean working too hard or too long: ""Overwork made her cranky and tired all the time.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3357,"<ul><li>As an adjective, particular describes something specific, such as when you prefer one particular type of cereal over another. The noun form means specific points or details, as in the particulars of a police investigation.</li><li>The idea of particular referring to details comes from the Latin particula, which means ""particle"" or ""small part,"" and in Middle English the word meant something that referred to a single person or thing.  You can note that in the phrase ""in particular"" which means ""especially."" As in, one breed of dog in particular would suit you best, with your floppy ears and friendly personality.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3358,"<ul><li>If you snore, you breathe loudly through your nose while you're asleep. If your roommate snores, you may need to get yourself some ear plugs so that you can sleep.</li><li>Most of us snore occasionally when we're congested, but some people snore every time they sleep. This kind of snore can be a serious health problem, since air isn't flowing easily in and out as the snorer breathes. In some cases, snoring is connected to sleep apnea, which means a sleeper actually stops breathing several times throughout the night. Colloquially, a snore is also a dull, boring thing: ""The movie was a total snore.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3359,"<ul><li>When something is done soundly, it's done in a firm, solid, or complete way. If the opposing kickball team beats your team 23 to zip, you could say that they defeated you soundly.</li><li>Something that is soundly built is sturdy. If your deck isn't made soundly, you may be understandably nervous to stand on it. When you sleep soundly, you rest very deeply. This last use of the word comes from a definition of sound dating from the mid-16th century and used only for sleep: ""undisturbed.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U18_3360,"<ul><li>A superintendent is the overseer of an organization. The term superintendent is most often used to refer to someone who oversees a school district and — most importantly — decides when to declare a snow day.</li><li>A superintendent is also the caretaker for a building, like an apartment complex. The superintendent is the person to call with maintenance issues, such as a broken lock or clogged toilet. Used in this sense, the word is often shortened to ""super."" A superintendent was originally a church official who oversaw several churches in a district. The word comes from the Latin superintendere, which means to oversee.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3361,"<ul><li>If you are having trouble breathing, you keep sneezing, and your head feels like it might explode, you may very well be congested. In other words, fluid may have built up in your sinuses and your lungs.</li><li>Being congested is a typical but very unpleasant symptom of the common cold. This adjective literally means “clogged,” “overcrowded,” or “overfull.” Congested is also used to describe arteries that are clogged, cities that are overpopulated, and roads that are full of traffic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3362,"<ul><li>A courier is a person you trust with delivering important messages or packages. Let your mail carrier deliver your credit card bill and the form letter from the “Save the Orchids” foundation, but trust a courier with your book contract or birth certificate.</li><li>Couriers are in a hurry. Do they saunter up your driveway the way a mail carrier does? No! Couriers are clearly on important business; they’re jogging. The word comes from a Latin word, currere, meaning “to run.” Nowadays, you might see couriers on bicycles, however, weaving in and out of traffic to deliver your messages on time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3363,"<ul><li>To deform is to force something to have a new shape by pushing or twisting it. While some kids love to shape animals out of clay, others prefer to deform their friends' elephants and puppies.</li><li>In physics or engineering, to deform something is to change its shape by applying force. You're more likely to come across the word deformed, used either as an adjective or a verb: ""My cat's paws are deformed—see, she's got two extra toes on every foot."" The source of this word is the verb deform, or ""disfigure,"" which comes from the Latin deformare, ""put out of shape.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3364,"<ul><li>Etiquette is a code of polite conduct. If you practice proper etiquette, you are less likely to offend or annoy people — and you may even charm them.</li><li>Many people think etiquette is about table manners in fancy restaurants, but quite simply, it is expected behavior that shows respect, meant to make everyone feel comfortable. For example, an etiquette book will tell you to bring a little gift when you are a dinner guest in someone's home, especially if it is your first visit — you know what is expected of you, and your gift shows respect and gratitude.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3365,"<ul><li>Exclusive means with limited access. The only way you might get reservations at one of the most exclusive restaurants in Los Angeles is to become friends with the maitre d', or become famous.</li><li>By its nature, something that is exclusive leaves people out, or excludes them. You would think this was a bad thing, since excluding people is not very nice, but by being exclusive, things like clubs, restaurants, and resorts become all the more desirable. Exclusive can also mean sole or only: The company became the exclusive soda vendor at the new stadium. The local newspaper got an exclusive interview and broke the news.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3366,"<ul><li>Like many nouns that can mean an action as well as an actual thing, freight refers to either the sending of goods or the goods themselves. It can also mean the charge for sending goods. You pay freight for the freight of your freight.</li><li>Freight can also be used as a verb. If you freight a train with goods, you load it up with items to be shipped, and if you freight your furniture to your new home in another state, you send it there. Use freight like this only if you are sending your things a long distance. If you your new apartment is only across town, you would say that you're moving your things to your new place.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3367,"<ul><li>A garment is a piece of clothing. The area of New York City where clothes are manufactured is known as the Garment District.</li><li>Derived from the French word for ""equipment,"" garment is a somewhat generic term you can use when the specific kind of clothing you're describing is not the point. A dress, for example, is a dress, and pants are pants. They are not the same thing, unless you refer to them both as garments, in which case they are the same thing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3368,"<ul><li>A person who has trouble falling or staying asleep is suffering from insomnia. If after a hot bath, a glass of warm milk, and hours of counting sheep, you still find yourself lying wide awake in bed, it's time to admit you have insomnia.</li><li>There's no cure for insomnia, but people with insomnia are advised to go to bed at the same time every night and to try to avoid stress. The noun insomnia was borrowed from Latin insomnis ""sleepless,"" from the prefix in-, ""not,"" plus somnus, ""sleep."" Somnus is actually related to Greek hypnos ""sleep,"" the source of English words such as hypnosis and hypnotic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3369,"<ul><li>If you're intuitive, you can probably guess what this word means just by looking at it. No? Maybe you're not so intuitive, after all. Intuitive means having the ability to understand or know something without any direct evidence or reasoning process.</li><li>Psychics are intuitive. So are mothers when they know you're lying. A process can be said to be intuitive as well, if it can be easily learned without any prior training — like an easy-to-learn software program. In human beings, intuitiveness is often thought of as something more mystical, as in the ability psychics have to predict the future.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3370,"<ul><li>If you drive into someone's fence, you’ll probably be held liable — legally responsible — for fixing it. Liable can also mean “likely,” usually with something unpleasant: ""If you don't brush your teeth, they're liable to fall out.""</li><li>When liable refers to legal responsibility, it's used with ""for"": ""You're liable for the court costs"" (meaning you have to pay them). When liable means ""likely,"" it's with ""to"": ""If you build your house on that cliff, it's liable to fall into the river,"" or ""That part of town is liable to mudslides."" Don't confuse liable with libel, which is a legal term for slander, or saying something false and damaging about someone.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3371,"<ul><li>If you obsess about something, you constantly think about it, like kids who obsess about their grades so much, they get upset before every test.</li><li>Obsess comes from the Latin word obsessus, which means to besiege, the way obsessive thoughts can besiege, or attack, your mind. You can obsess about something, like the tiny spot on your shoes that no one can even see, or be obsessed, or haunted or preoccupied by something. For example, the memory of a big, delicious dinner could obsess a hungry man.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3372,"<ul><li>You can only fall overboard if you're on a boat. If you fall overboard, don't forget your life vest!</li><li>The adverb overboard most often comes up when someone falls in the water. When it's used literally, it very specifically refers to the movement of a person or an object from a boat into the ocean or other body of water. Figuratively, to go overboard means to take something too far — you're going overboard on your diet if you refuse to eat anything that isn't green.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3373,"<ul><li>Something that's premium is much better than average — it's excellent, in fact. A premium seat at a rock concert is right up front, with a great view of the stage.</li><li>When premium is a noun, it means the money you pay each month for your car insurance or a charge that's added on top of a standard payment. It also means a prize or reward. As an adjective, premium implies something of superior quality that probably costs more too. Premium comes straight out of Latin, meaning “reward.” It was first used as an adjective around 1925, in the phrase ""premium butter.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3374,"<ul><li>A privilege is a special advantage not enjoyed by everyone. If you're very snooty, you probably don't allow just anyone the privilege of being your friend.</li><li>Privilege comes from Latin privilegium, meaning a law for just one person, and means a benefit enjoyed by an individual or group beyond what's available to others. Someone wealthy come from privilege. Someone with a library card has borrowing privileges. Privilege can also be used as a verb. If you are on a committee giving away scholarships, you'll have to decide whether to privilege students from poor backgrounds or the students with high test scores.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3375,"<ul><li>To propel is to push or drive forward, like a sheep dog nipping at the heels of his flock to keep them moving.</li><li>When you hear the verb propel,  imagine the propeller on an airplane — that spinning thing on the front that pulls the plane forward. Or maybe think of the old proverb that goes, “Our passions are the winds that propel our vessel. Our reason is the pilot that steers her. Without winds the vessel would not move and without a pilot she would be lost.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3376,"<ul><li>When you socialize, you participate in activities in a group setting. If you have been studying alone for some time, you might take a break at the coffee shop to socialize with some friends.</li><li>You can socialize somebody else, or educate her in social patterns. Parents socialize their kids through their upbringing, and clubs often socialize their members through a uniform.  If you want to hang out with motorcyclists, you might want to dress in leather. It is also possible to socialize institutions, where benefits are open to a wide section of society. If voters socialize medicine, that service becomes available to all at government expense.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3377,"<ul><li>To suppress something means to curb, inhibit, or even stop it. If the sound of your boss moving in his chair sounds like gas, you’re going to have to learn how to suppress your giggles.</li><li>In the strictest sense, suppress means to put an end to something by force, like a government that suppresses the right to free speech by shutting down the newspapers or the military suppressing an uprising by rebel forces. But we also use suppress in less serious terms to describe an attempt to muffle or stifle something, such as suppressing a sneeze in a quiet theater or suppressing your true emotions to not cause a teary scene.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3378,"<ul><li>A tram is a trolley or a streetcar—it's a vehicle that transports people using electricity from overhead cables while running on tracks that are set into the street.</li><li>In the U.S., you might also call a tram a cable car or light rail. If you've been on a streetcar in San Francisco or a trolley in Philadelphia, you've ridden a tram. The word tram was originally a Scottish term for the wagons that are used in coal mines, stemming from a Middle Flemish word meaning ""rung or handle of a barrow.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3379,"<ul><li>To unsettle is to make someone feel disconcerted and disturbed. After you watch a scary horror movie, every little sound in your dark house will probably unsettle you.</li><li>Things that leave you uneasy or anxious unsettle you, whether you receive a creepy prank phone call or have to start at a new school after moving in the middle of the year. A spooky mystery novel might unsettle you, especially if you read it at night, while falling stock prices tend to unsettle Wall Street experts. Use this verb whenever things feel upsetting and unstable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U19_3380,"<ul><li>To warp is to bend, twist, or otherwise become misshapen. Wooden furniture left outside in the rain will often warp from the moisture.</li><li>Getting wet makes some things warp, while plastic has a tendency to warp in the hot sun. Sometimes people use the word colloquially to mean ""have a bad or distorting influence on,"" as when a politician insists that video games warp kids' minds. In weaving, the warp is all of the threads running one direction — the ones that are woven over and under the warp are called the weft.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3381,"<ul><li>To accumulate means to gather, usually in large quantities. Let's hope your boyfriend is not the type to accumulate girlfriends.</li><li>The root of accumulate is cumulus which means ""mound"" or ""heap."" You might have heard of cumulus clouds, those big fluffy clouds that look like giant piles of whipped cream. Think of these heaping helpings of clouds when you think of accumulate. The money in your savings account accumulates interest, though these days you won't accumulate much wealth that way! Police accumulate evidence until they have enough to charge someone with a crime.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3382,"<ul><li>Things that are aerial are happening in the air: birds, planes, and missiles are all aerial things.</li><li>When talking about things that are literally up in the air, you can use the word aerial. If a country sends planes to bomb another country, that's an aerial attack. In football, the passing game is called the aerial game. Anything light and airy can also be called aerial, and an aerial is a device that picks up radio or TV signals: it plucks them out of the air. So when you see the word aerial, just think ""air.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3383,"<ul><li>Your apparatus is the collective equipment you use for specific purposes. For example, the apparatus used for scuba diving includes goggles, flippers, and a breathing tank, while a surgeon’s apparatus includes various scalpels and clamps. Different activities, different apparatuses.</li><li>The noun apparatus evolved from the Latin apparātus, meaning ""equipment or preparation."" It might refer to one item, (a breathing apparatus) or a group of items (sports apparatus). Here’s a spelling tip: often, when a word ends in -us, the plural ending changes to i — “alumnus/alumni,” “focus/foci.” However, apparatus is part of the group that doesn't change — words like “virus/viruses” or “census/censuses.” This means the plural is either apparatus or apparatuses, though the latter is more common.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3384,"<ul><li>Look out below! An avalanche is a whole lot of falling snow and ice. Also, life can feel like an avalanche when things get hectic.</li><li>Avalanche may be a fun word, but it's not a fun thing. If you were in a real, literal avalanche, then a huge amount of snow, ice, rocks, and mud would be falling off a mountain — potentially on to you. People get killed in avalanches. On the other hand, if every teacher in school gives you homework on the same night, that is ""an avalanche of schoolwork."" You'll survive it, but it's not much fun at the time.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3385,"<ul><li>Foods like puddings and gravies need to be the correct consistency — that is, the right thickness or texture — for the dish. It would not be good, for example, for gravy to have the consistency of cottage cheese.</li><li>The noun consistency also refers to uniformity or compatibility between things or parts. For example, you might need to check the consistency of spelling in a document or the consistency among eye-witness accounts of a crime. Consistency usually implies a positive sense of dependability. If you show consistency at the work place, your manager can depend on you.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3386,"<ul><li>To discharge is to fire a gun or an employee, or to set someone free from a hospital or jail. You'd probably like being discharged from jail, but not from your job, unless you really hate it.</li><li>As a verb, discharge is “to release,” and as a noun, it refers to the act of or setting free. You'd be discharged from the hospital once the discharge from your wound has stopped. Ew. The writer Ambrose Bierce jokingly defined emotion as ""a prostrating disease caused by a determination of the heart to the head. It is sometimes accompanied by a copious discharge of hydrated chloride of sodium from the eyes.” Wouldn't want to cry in front of that guy!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3387,"<ul><li>Think of your favorite TV show. It runs all year long, in weekly installments. Each of those individual programs is an episode, one part of a long series.</li><li>Episode, a term from Greek tragedy, refers to a section of a story. In the 19th century, Charles Dickens published chapters of his novels in weekly magazines, episodes that together made a novel. You can also use the word for events in your own life: ""That was an unpleasant episode,"" when you're remembering a family fight, or, ""Grandpa had a fainting episode."" With the fighting and fainting, you can hope they're episodes, not the whole story.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3388,"<ul><li>If something is intact it's still in one piece. If you'd like your sand castle to remain intact, I suggest you build it away from the water.</li><li>The Latin word intactus means “untouched,” but today something is intact if it's whole, if it hasn't fallen apart. After a long day at work, you might feel lucky to be intact. Your letter to the post office states that you would prefer your packages to arrive intact from now on.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3389,"<ul><li>You are a mortal because you are mortal. This means that you are an individual destined to die because you are susceptible to death.</li><li>The word mortal has one of the most ancient genealogies of any word in English or any other language. It is related to English words like ""murder"" and ""mortuary,"" and to the French, Italian, Spanish, and Russian words for ""death."" Something that can kill you can also be described as mortal. If you're in mortal danger, you're in a deadly situation. Action heroes often think they are dealing their enemy a mortal blow, but sometimes the enemy manages to come back to life. People are called mortals because at some point, they die.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3390,"<ul><li>An omen is an event or happening that you take as sign of something to come. It’s believed to be a bad omen if a black cat crosses your path or if it rains on your wedding day.</li><li>Omens generally get a bad rap — that's probably because a lot of them predict bad stuff, at least according to superstition. But the interpretation of omens really depends on the country and culture. What's considered an ominous sign in one place might mean a lifetime of good luck somewhere else. Oscar Wilde once wrote that, “There is no such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel for that.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3391,"<ul><li>Use the adjective overcast when you're describing a cloudy sky. An overcast day can be dark, cold, and gloomy, or just quiet and calm.</li><li>A day that's gray and cloudy is overcast, and a dull, sunless sky can also be described this way. A less common way to use overcast is when you talk about sewing — an overcast stitch catches the edge of the fabric to keep it from fraying — and the stitch itself is sometimes called an overcast. Before the weather-related adjective was coined, overcast was a verb meaning ""to cover"" or ""to overthrow.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3392,"<ul><li>Something that is poignant touches you deeply. Watching a poignant YouTube video about baby penguins chasing their mothers, for example, might give you a lump in your throat.</li><li>Poignant comes from the Latin pungere ""to prick,"" the same root as pungent. But something that's pungent pricks your sense of smell, whereas poignant refers to something that pricks your emotions, especially in a melancholy way. Movie critics might describe a touching portrayal as poignant if there isn't a dry eye in the house.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3393,"<ul><li>A ranger is a person who takes care of a park or a piece of land. A park ranger makes sure the rules are followed and provides information to visitors.</li><li>Someone who takes a job as a forest ranger might patrol an area of wooded land, watching for fire danger and enforcing the rules. A ranger's tasks can vary from teaching kids about local plants and animals to fighting fires to arresting people who break laws in a state or national park. The original rangers were British employees of the king or queen who would ""range"" throughout the woods looking for poachers — people who illegally hunted on royal land.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3394,"<ul><li>The pile of crumbled debris that's left over after something breaks or collapses is rubble. Famous scenes of rubble include the fallen Twin Towers on September 11 and the remains of the Haitian capital after the 2010 earthquake.</li><li>Rubble rhymes with ""bubble,"" but when a bubble bursts, it just dissolves into liquid, while rubble is piles of rock, concrete, brick, and other remains that are a very physical reminder of destruction. Rock slides create rubble from rocks, and natural disasters and explosions create rubble from buildings, cars, and trees. Unfortunately, rubble is usually heavy and can trap people or things beneath it, as when bodies are found in the rubble of a fire or earthquake.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3395,"<ul><li>When you seclude someone, you separate them from other people. A Buddhist monk might seclude himself in a remote place to meditate alone for several weeks.</li><li>Most people use the verb seclude to talk about shutting themselves away from society or keeping themselves separate from others. An eccentric family might seclude itself from the neighbors, for example. The root is Latin, secludere, which means ""shut off or confine,"" from se, ""apart"" and cludere, ""to shut."" Originally, seclude was used to mean ""to enclose or confine,"" and by the 1620s it also meant ""to keep from public view.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3396,"<ul><li>When something occurs on or in the direction of one side, it happens sideways. You can lean over sideways to see if your cat's hiding under the bed, or tip a teapot sideways to pour the last drops out.</li><li>Sideways works as an adjective or adverb to describe things that lean toward one side or at an angle. A sideways tilt to a motorcycle might look scary, but it's safe if the rider is experienced. You can also use this word figuratively for ""indirect"" or ""unconventional."" So you might describe a movie that approaches serious subjects from a sideways perspective, using comedy. Sideways dates from the mid-16th century.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3397,"<ul><li>If you're so upset you're crying loudly, taking in big gasps of air and heaving your chest, you are sobbing.</li><li>Picture a child on the playground who has fallen and can't find his or her mother. The child's face is red and streaked with tears, and he or she is gasping from crying so hard. This poor little boy or girl is sobbing uncontrollably. Sometimes, while trying not to cry, you might let out a single sob. A ""sob story"" is a story meant to make you feel bad for someone, so bad you might sob for them.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3398,"<ul><li>This adjective means the opposite of playful or drunk. When attending a funeral, you are expected to be sober in both senses.</li><li>The most common meaning of sober is ""not drunk"" — people who drive need to be sober. Sober sounds a lot like somber, and it often means sad and quiet too, or sometimes too serious. Another meaning is to be logical or realistic about something. Sometimes sober means drab: a grey station wagon is a more sober vehicle than a hot red convertible. All of these meanings are quiet and restrained — unlike a person who has had a lot to drink.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3399,"<ul><li>A speck is a tiny patch or spot. At night, the stars look like glittering specks against the sky. And when you look up at the night sky, you might feel like a mere speck in the universe.</li><li>A speck is a bit of color or light, or a very slight amount of something: ""I'd like my eggs with lots of salt and just a speck of pepper."" If you're extremely tidy, discovering specks of sand on your jeans after a walk on the beach might prompt you to change your clothes. Speck can be traced back to the Old English specca, ""small spot or stain,"" but beyond that its origin remains a mystery.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U20_3400,"<ul><li>Your upbringing is how you were raised as a child. You might have had a rough upbringing or a gentler one, but at least you made it this far.</li><li>Looking at the base “bring” in upbringing, we find a Germanic origin meaning ""to carry."" You might consider the ""carry"" idea as a way to remember the word, considering a parent ""carries"" a child to adulthood, providing what then becomes the child’s upbringing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3401,"<ul><li>Bliss is a state of complete happiness or joy. Marriage is often associated with this joyous feeling: people who are married and still in love are described as living in wedded bliss.</li><li>Another common association is heaven or paradise, as in eternal bliss. Bliss is from Middle English blisse, from Old English bliss, blīths. The final -s in this Old English word is actually a suffix and the word itself is related to blīthe, the source of modern English blithe, which means happy.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U21_3403,"<ul><li>When a muscle in your body tenses up painfully, it's a cramp. If you get a cramp in your leg when you're swimming, you have to stop and stretch out the muscle until the cramp goes away.</li><li>Muscle cramps are a side effect of exercise and fatigue, and they can often be avoided by stretching before and after a run or a game of basketball. Cramp is also a verb, meaning both ""contract painfully,"" and also ""hold back, or prevent free movement."" This is what you mean when you say, ""Mom, please don't walk me in to school — you'll cramp my style.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3404,"<ul><li>Putting up paintings, stringing up lights, and getting some flowers are all ways to decorate a house. When you decorate, you make things look better or at least more interesting.</li><li>Even an attractively furnished home can be decorated for a holiday or party. That means you dress up your house to celebrate the special occasion. Decorate is also used to describe certain kinds of success. A famous athlete might decorate a gym with trophies and championship rings. We say a person in the military, like a general, is decorated when he or she is given medals for bravery or other accomplishments.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3405,"<ul><li>Falling down and in total disrepair, something that's dilapidated is going to need a lot of fixing up.</li><li>Sure, there might be crooked floorboards, mice scurrying underfoot, and pieces missing from the ceiling, but that dilapidated house does come with one perk: a cheaper price tag! Dilapidated is a word that implies deterioration, often because of neglect. So if you don’t take care of things, they can become dilapidated. That goes for houses, tree forts, relationships, health —  you name it!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3406,"<ul><li>The verb evoke most commonly means to bring a feeling, memory, or picture into the mind. When you visit your old elementary school, the smells, sounds, and colors there can evoke memories from the past.</li><li>Similarly, a certain reaction can be evoked by words or actions, as in ""His comments evoked anger in the community."" A near synonym is elicit, as in ""No matter how many different ways the detective questioned the suspect, he could not elicit any response. Evoke was borrowed from Latin evocare, from the prefix e- ""out,"" plus vocare ""to call.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3407,"<ul><li>If you’re saying goodbye to someone you might not see for long time, say farewell, preferably while waving a hankie from the Queen Mary before it sails across the Atlantic. Farewell is a fancy way to say goodbye.</li><li>A farewell is also an expression of good wishes at a parting. If you’re leaving a job after being there a long time, your co-workers might throw you a farewell party. Farewell is an expression, like ""goodbye,"" but also a noun — if you like to leave without a lot of fuss, you don’t like long farewells. Farewell is a combination of fare and well. Fare comes from the Old English word faran, which means ""to journey.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3408,"<ul><li>Water comes out of your faucet and into your sink or bathtub. A faucet is a device that allows you to turn the flow of water on and off.</li><li>The faucet is not just the metal part that the water comes through, it is the whole mechanism for controlling the flow of water. If you cry easily, someone might say you are a regular faucet. This is because water comes out of your eyes more often than it does for most people. If you ask your parents a little too often for cash, they might joke that they're going to turn off the money faucet.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3409,"<ul><li>Filth is disgusting dirt, grime, or other unsavory material. Filth is dog poop all over the sidewalk, gunk under a movie seat.</li><li>You can use the noun filth when you're talking about some grimy substance, like the smelly filth on the bottom of your shoes after you've walked across a cow pasture. You can also call a general state of uncleanliness filth. You might say that the filth in your brother's room makes it impossible to open the door. Some people also use this word for material they deem to be obscene. The Old English root word is fylð, which means ""rotting matter."" Ew.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3410,"<ul><li>A flaw can be a sign of weakness or defect. If you try to make wings and fly off the roof but wind up crashing in the gutter, there's a flaw in your plan.</li><li>In the early 14th century, when the noun flaw was first recorded, it referred to a snowflake or spark of fire. That sense is now obsolete, and now we use flaw to describe shortcomings in either character or object. We all have flaws. It can also describe an intentional mark of imperfection. “You see,” said the dancer Martha Graham, “when weaving a blanket, an Indian woman leaves a flaw in the weaving of that blanket to let the soul out.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3411,"<ul><li>When you grin, you smile. You're likely to grin when your sister tells you a particularly funny knock-knock joke.</li><li>There's some disagreement about the difference between a grin and a smile — some define a grin as a broad smile that exposes your teeth, but others consider a grin to be a smile with lips tightly closed. Either way, a grin usually expresses amusement, although it sometimes has a mischievous or sly implication: ""No one confessed to letting the rabbit loose in the classroom, but one student's grin gave her away.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3412,
4000EEW_B06_U21_3413,"<ul><li>A mound is a heap or a pile of material or objects. You can make a mound of clothes by dumping your laundry onto your bed.</li><li>The noun mound is occasionally used to mean ""a hill,"" but it most often describes a manmade pile, like a mound of stones or a mound of sand heaped on the beach, or a mound of snow that you sculpt into a rabbit. On a baseball diamond, the pitcher's mound is the little rise on which the pitcher stands to throw the ball. As a verb, mound means to pile something into a heaped shape.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3414,"<ul><li>Numb is an adjective that describes a lack of sensation. After skiing all day, your toes might be numb from the cold. You'd feel numb for hours after hearing that your favorite band broke up.</li><li>People can feel numb in terms of their feelings and emotions. For example, if you've had your heart broken lots of times, you start to become numb — the breakups don't upset you so much. Numb can also describe being so frightened that you can't move, like being numb with fear when you saw the bear near your campsite. Numb can also mean ""to make insensitive,"" like when the dentist numbs your gums so you won't feel any pain.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3415,"<ul><li>If you are reckless, you don't think or care about the consequences of your words or actions, like a reckless driver who speeds while texting, knitting, and eating a sandwich.</li><li>The word reckless comes from the Old English word receleas, meaning ""careless, thoughtless, heedless."" If you have a reckless attitude, you aren't concerned about what happens to yourself or others who are affected by your actions. In this usage, reckless is the opposite of considerate. Reckless friends will invite people you don't know to your house because with your parents away, it's party time. Surprise!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3416,"<ul><li>Slate is a type of gray metamorphic rock that is made up of quartz and other minerals. The rock can be split into thin layers and the slate used for things like roofing tiles.</li><li>In the past when paper was expensive, schoolchildren used slates to do their school work. These were usually made of actual slate rock. Students could practice their writing on the slate with a slate pencil. When they were done, the slate could be erased, which gave rise to the term ""clean slate."" If you've done things in the past you aren't proud of, you may hope to start over with a clean slate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3417,
4000EEW_B06_U21_3418,"<ul><li>A testament is a statement of belief. The most famous testaments are the two parts of the Christian Bible: the Old and New Testaments.</li><li>A testament states a belief or gives some kind of direction. The document people leave behind at death is known as the ""last will and testament."" It gives lawyers directions for dividing their possessions among family and friends. Also, you could say that an A in math class is a testament to your math skills. If you give to charity, that’s a testament to your character. Any testament is a strong statement of some kind.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3419,"<ul><li>Timber! That's the call of warning you hear before a tree falls. That's because those lumberjacks are going to use the tree to make timber, otherwise known as ""lumber"" or the wood used for construction.</li><li>Timber can actually be the trees used to make or build something, or the wood that comes from those trees, which you could also call ""lumber."" You might think that when a pirate yells ""shiver me timbers!"" he's referring to his wooden peg leg. But the timbers he's talking about are actually the boards and planks used to build the frame of a ship.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U21_3420,"<ul><li>A valve is a device that controls the flow of a liquid or gas. Before you fix the broken sink in your bathroom, you should turn the valve that shuts off the water.</li><li>The simplest type of valve has a hinged flap allowing liquid to flow one direction, but blocking it from going the other way. This is called a ""check valve."" Anatomical valves  — systems in your body that allow a flow of fluid, like the aortic valve near your heart  — are structured very much the same way. The shells of mollusks like oysters and clams are also called valves. The word's earliest meaning was ""one half of a folding door.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3421,"<ul><li>To camouflage is to disguise, and a camouflage is that which disguises — like the leaf-colored and patterned uniforms worn by soldiers who want to blend in with their natural surroundings.</li><li>Camouflage evolved from the French camoufler, which was slang for “to disguise.” Camoufler itself most likely comes from camouflet, meaning “puff of smoke” — a puff of smoke that makes it hard to see things. Camouflaged clothing certainly hides hunters from their prey, but the word can also be used in a more figurative sense, as in camouflaging criticism by veiling it as a backhanded compliment.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3422,"<ul><li>Confront means either to face a situation that makes you uncomfortable, or to say something to someone about something they've done that bothers you. Rather than letting things go, when people are rude to you you should confront them.</li><li>Confront derives from the Latin con- ""with"" and -front ""front."" You can confront a sad truth, you can confront a person by calling them on their behavior, you can confront someone with the fact that they have terrible breath. You can be confronted, too—on the trip through the mountains, we were confronted by the impassibility of the road.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3423,"<ul><li>Before you accept a job offer, or a college's offer of admission, you should take time to contemplate the pros and cons of your decision. If you contemplate something, you think about it carefully.</li><li>Contemplate is from Latin contemplatus, past participle of contemplari ""to gaze attentively, observe,"" from the prefix com- ""together"" plus templum ""temple."" The original meaning of Latin contemplari was ""to mark out a space for observing auguries or omens,"" and the temple was a holy space reserved for this purpose.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3424,"<ul><li>To defend a belief or keep affirming that it's true is to contend. People used to contend that the earth was flat, but eventually, when no one dropped off the edge no matter how far they traveled, the ""round"" theory won.</li><li>One of the meanings of contend is from the French ""to strive with,"" and it is a literal fighting, as in ""to contend with fists."" Most contemporary uses of the verb contend illustrate competitions of proof or defense, where a person will contend that something is true, or better, or wrong. It is still a striving but more of a verbal kind, where what you contend is what you hope to convince others is correct.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3425,"<ul><li>A cot is a small, portable bed. You might sleep on a cot when you go camping.</li><li>Some hotels offer cots for extra guests who stay in your room, and campers and soldiers on the move often use cots for sleeping. A cot's benefits include its light weight and ability to be folded into an easily carried size. In Britain, a cot is a baby bed or crib. Cot has a Hindi source, khat, ""couch, bed, or hammock"" from the Sanskrit khatva.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3426,"<ul><li>To enlist is to voluntarily join the military. You may have seen television commercials or posters encouraging people to enlist.</li><li>There are various ways people end up in the military. Sometimes there's a draft, which selects people whether they want to go or not. Sometimes people enlist, which means they sign up on their own. Enlisting also refers to recruiting or hiring people for some purpose or organization. If you are moving, you might try to enlist your friends to help — good luck with that.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3427,"<ul><li>A frontier represents uncharted territory. It could be a remote piece of land or a new field of study, but if someone calls it ""the frontier,"" you are challenged to explore it.</li><li>The noun frontier has several meanings. It can refer to the wilderness at the edge of a settled area (picture covered wagons pushing westward) or it can mean a field of study that has not yet been explored (picture genetically engineering pet dinosaurs). Deriving from ""the front line of an army,"" a frontier can be thought of as an offensive line in a battle — always pushing forward, trying to conquer new territory.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3428,"<ul><li>The word guerilla is another way to spell ""guerrilla"": a member of a small, loosely organized army that fights a larger, stronger force.  If you're a guerilla, you confront enemies unexpectedly and use tactics such as sabotage, raids, and ambushes.</li><li>A guerilla is not a member of a state-sponsored army. Instead he or she is part of a smaller, independent army that fights a larger, more established force by using tactics that include the element of surprise. Also known as an insurgent or irregular, a guerilla usually exists outside mainstream society and typically has taken a position of active revolt or rebellion against the established ruling power.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3429,"<ul><li>A handbook is a guide or list of instructions on one particular subject. A new car comes with a handbook explaining how its controls work and giving tips for problems that arise. Sometimes new parents wish their newborn infant came with a handbook.</li><li>A handbook is a type of reference book, offering information about a topic or a machine. Your bird handbook might include pictures of birds in your region, and the handbook that came with your blender will tell you how to use it and also might include several smoothie recipes. In Old English, it was handboc, though in Middle English this was replaced by manual, thought at the time to be a much prettier word.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3430,"<ul><li>When you’re feeling hesitant, you aren’t sure what to do, so instead of taking action you wait a little, biding your time until you figure out what option is best.</li><li>The Latin word haesitant translates as “being undecided,” and not being able to decide is exactly what makes you hesitant.  Being hesitant will make you hesitate for a bit, waiting to see what happens next. Nervousness or fear will make your actions hesitant, like when trying to walk across a rickety wooden bridge.  Should you keep going or turn back?  Your hesitant steps show that you’re still wrestling with that question.  Whatever you decide, don’t look down.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3431,"<ul><li>Lush describes something growing in abundance, like the lush green grass that covers the lawn in the spring.</li><li>Lush usually describes thick healthy plant growth, like the jungles of the rainforest that were so lush you couldn't walk through without chopping down branches. (Then it wasn't so lush anymore...oops!) Lush also means ""plush"" or even ""extravagant"" — like a thick shag carpet, music with lots of layers, or a bedroom wallpapered in velvet. Plants full of juice are lush, which is perhaps why a person who drinks too much alcohol is called a lush.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3432,"<ul><li>You can use the noun outfit to mean clothes that go together, like a shirt and pants that you always wear to job interviews. You might have spent hours choosing your first-day-of-school outfit.</li><li>An outfit is often selected for a special occasion, like a graduation outfit, an outfit for your cousin's party, or your rodeo outfit. An outfit is also a kit or set of tools that serve a specific purpose, and as a verb it means ""provide with"" or ""equip."" A girl scout leader, for example, will outfit her troops with water and sunblock for a long hike on a sunny summer day.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3433,"<ul><li>A paw is a four-legged animal's foot. Dogs, cats, rabbits, and bears all have paws. Sharks? Not so much.</li><li>Most paws have claws and soft pads that cushion the animal's legs as it walks. Cats' paws have sharp, retractable claws, while dogs have hard, dull claws that don't retract. There are also many animals with four legs that don't have paws, like horses and lizards. If an animal paws you, it nudges or scrapes you with its paw. If a person paws you, they use their hands clumsily, almost as if they were paws.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3434,"<ul><li>Looking truly magnificent today? Then someone (probably British) might stop you to say ""Wow! You look splendid, darling!"" Thanks the person, because splendid means glorious, fabulous, wonderful, and/or splendiferous.</li><li>Use the adjective splendid to describe something of the highest quality. If you're so lucky as to have someone buy you, say, a Harry Winston diamond, splendid! But splendid doesn't apply only to expensive items such as jewelry, clothing, or art. You can also have a splendid idea, morning walk, or encounter with an old friend. For some, using Splenda in their coffee instead of sugar is, for them, well, splendid!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3435,"<ul><li>Little Red Riding Hood strayed from the path and ended up getting eaten by the Big Bad Wolf. When you stray, you wander off without paying attention to where you're going, and sometimes you get in trouble.</li><li>Stray can be used as a verb or as a noun. Your attention may stray when you're tired and listening to a very boring lecture. You may be the kind of person who brings home strays, the dogs and cats that have wandered away from their homes and are lost and hungry. When you're organizing your sock drawer and you've got one sock without a mate, you might find the stray sock left behind in the dryer.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3436,"<ul><li>Something substantial is large in size, number, or amount: If you want to say someone spent a lot of money without being too specific, you could say they spent a substantial amount of money.</li><li>The adjective substantial derives from the Latin substantia ""substance,"" which means ""stuff."" A substantial meal is large enough to satisfy hunger. A substantial structure is strongly made or built. And a substantial man possesses wealth and property. Related to this last sense, ""a man of substance"" refers to a wealthy man with property.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3437,"<ul><li>A torch is a handheld light. Although flashlights are sometimes called ""torches,"" technically a torch has a burning flame.</li><li>Torch can also be used as a verb indicating that something has been purposely set on fire. For example, arsonists have been known to torch empty buildings just for fun. This meaning dates to 1931. The noun form of torch has been around a lot longer. In the late 13th century torch came into English from the Old French word torche, or ""twisted thing,"" which was a piece of wax-dipped rope.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3438,"<ul><li>A tract is a large, open piece of land — like that tract of farmland you bought when you decided your dream in life was to raise llamas. Tract is also a word for a short pamphlet or booklet, like that tract you recently read entitled ""The Care and Feeding of Llamas.""</li><li>In addition to referring to areas of land and small booklets, the word tract can describe complicated systems or structures in the body. If you were to unwind your intestine, an important part of your digestive tract, it would not stretch across a large tract of land, but only 25-28 feet — but that's still pretty long! (You probably don't need to read a tract on human anatomy to realize this would be an unhealthy experiment.)</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3439,"<ul><li>A vigil is when you stay alert to guard something, as when you keep vigil over your hen house when the foxes are out. A vigil can also be solemn, as when a candlelight vigil is held for victims of a tragedy.</li><li>Vigil comes from the Latin word for ""awake,"" and all its meanings include the idea of watchfulness. If you're attending a vigil or keeping vigil, you shouldn't expect to take a nap. The vigil is an apt kind of demonstration for peace movements, as it's calm, non-violent, and solemn, with participants standing quietly —  sometimes holding candles.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U22_3440,"<ul><li>Weary as an adjective means ""very tired or worn out,"" like weary students who finished a long week of studying and taking tests.</li><li>Weary comes from the Old English word werig, meaning ""tired."" It can also describe being extremely bored and sick of something, like on a long drive, you might grow weary of your father's singing voice. As a  verb, weary means ""to exhaust or wear out,"" like when the children you are babysitting weary you with their game of running away every time you tell them to get ready to leave the park.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U23_3442,"<ul><li>Backstage is the area of a theater where the actors wait until it's time to walk onstage and play their parts. The audience can't see what's going on backstage.</li><li>If you get a backstage pass at a rock concert, it means you'll get to go behind the scenes once the show is over, and possibly meet the musicians in person. Many people who are involved in a show, performance, or play stay backstage the whole time: costume designers, makeup directors, and set painters, for example. The word is also sometimes used in a figurative way to mean ""secret"" or ""behind the scenes.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3443,"<ul><li>Someone who lives in the U.S. and has money, property, and investments worth at least a billion dollars is a billionaire.</li><li>Being a billionaire is dependent on a country's currency; in Europe, a net worth of a billion Euros makes someone a billionaire. There are around 2,500 Americans in this category, each possessing at least $1 billion — or a thousand million dollars. During the pandemic, U.S. billionaires increased their wealth by than $1.7 trillion dollars. The French billion was originally defined as ""a million million,"" from bi-, ""two,"" and million, but that was altered to ""a thousand million.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3444,"<ul><li>His road rage may turn your dad into a brute when he gets behind the wheel. A brute is a person who is as ferocious as a wild animal.</li><li>A violent, savage person can be described as a brute, and so can a wild animal. Someone who's less monstrous but is still unpleasant can also be a brute, and it can be used as an adjective to mean, basically, ""brutal."" If it's more animal than human, you can call it brute, like the brute power of an invading army. The Latin brutus, ""heavy, dull, or stupid,"" gave rise to brute, which through the 15th century only referred to animals.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3445,"<ul><li>Someone clumsy is a klutz. They're awkward, ungraceful, and walk like they have two left feet. Something hard to handle — like a huge box — is also clumsy.</li><li>A badly told story is told in a clumsy way, and a couch that's hard to move clumsy to carry. But mostly being clumsy is embarrassing. Dropping things, tripping a lot, and stumbling are all examples of clumsiness. Clumsy people usually aren't too good at sports or dancing. And you certainly don't want a clumsy surgeon. Most people are a little clumsy when they're teenagers — growing so fast makes it hard to be sure of yourself physically.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3446,"<ul><li>It could be protons bouncing around in a particle accelerator, two cars failing to stop at an intersection, or the priorities of two people with very different goals. When things crash together, they collide.</li><li>The verb collide has roots in the Latin word collidere, which comes from col- or  “together” and laedere, “to strike or damage,"" like planes that collide in midair. Collide can also describe ideas that clash, such as expectations that collide with reality or radical views that collide with tradition.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3447,"<ul><li>A culprit is a person who does something wrong, like committing a crime. When your wallet got stolen out of your pocket, there was a culprit to blame in the crowd.</li><li>The word culprit comes from the Anglo French words cul prit, a contraction of culpable, which means ""deserving blame."" A culprit isn't always a person; it can be anything that caused something bad to happen — even a sock left on the steps can be a culprit if it makes you slip and fall. Don't confuse culprit with scapegoat, which is a person or thing that gets blamed for something it didn't do.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3448,"<ul><li>To evacuate is to flee, like how people leave an area when a hurricane is coming. It also means to empty something completely.</li><li>If you have to evacuate your home, something horrible is probably happening, like a natural disaster. People evacuate when something like a tornado or act of terrorism makes their homes unsafe. To evacuate also means to empty completely, in the bathroom-oriented sense of evacuating (emptying) your bowels. Similarly, if a chemist empties and therefore creates a vacuum in a flask, she has evacuated the flask. When you evacuate, you clear out.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3449,"<ul><li>Be careful with matches around gasoline, dry grass, and old wood because they are all very flammable and might catch on fire.</li><li>Flammable is a pretty straightforward word with one odd fact about it. The word, inflammable, which sounds like the opposite of flammable, actually means the same thing — easily catching on fire. If you want to say that something won't catch fire easily, use fireproof and you'll be sure to be right.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3450,"<ul><li>A mob is a big, rowdy group of people. You might avoid shopping at the mall right before Christmas because you can't stand the mob of shoppers.</li><li>A mob might gather around the piñata at a big birthday party or cluster in front of a music venue when tickets go on sale for a hugely popular concert. When people join one of these groups, you can also say that they mob, and ""the mob"" also sometimes refers to organized crime. You might describe the hundreds of people thronging the county fair on Friday night as a ""mob scene."" The Latin root, mobile vulgus, means ""fickle common people.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3451,"<ul><li>Premature means ""not yet ready."" Something that is premature arrives early, like a premature baby born before her due date, or the soggy cake you took out of the oven prematurely.</li><li>Premature is a simple word to break down. Pre means ""early"" or ""before,"" and mature means ""done"" or ""ready."" If a decision is criticized as premature, it means that that decision was made too hastily, and probably would have been different if more time had been taken. If someone dies very young, you might say they died prematurely.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3452,"<ul><li>To resent something is to feel anger or bitterness toward it. You might resent someone who has treated you poorly.</li><li>To resent is a strong, negative feeling.  You may resent the accusation that you were stealing cookies, or when a teacher yelled at you for whispering, even though everyone else was too. You might resent a friend who has more money or friends than you. Lots of people resent celebrities because they're famous and wealthy.  If your friend borrowed a sweater and didn’t return it, you would probably resent it. Resenting is the opposite of being grateful.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3453,"<ul><li>Satire is a way of making fun of people by using silly or exaggerated language. Politicians are easy targets for satire, especially when they're acting self-righteous or hypocritical.</li><li>Even though the ridiculous language of satire isn't intended to be taken seriously, well-made satire can use mockery to get at more serious truths. Sometimes satire can even overtake reality: when the television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live presented a mock debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign season, the satire was so dead-on that it influenced the way people thought of the candidates.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3454,"<ul><li>Scrutiny is when you look at something really closely, like when you are checking a test for mistakes. Scrutiny can also be an intense look, like when your mother looks at you — trying to tell if you might be lying.</li><li>Scrutiny comes from the Latin scrutari, which means “to search,” but which originally meant, “to sort trash.” When you turn in a draft of your essay, you are subjecting it to your teacher's scrutiny — and there's a good chance that she'll find some sentences that can be ""trashed"" as well as sections that could be improved.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3455,"<ul><li>To separate people by race or religion is to segregate them. In general, the word segregate means to separate one type of thing from another.</li><li>In the United States, the practice of segregating blacks from whites in public schools and public places was common in the South until the 1960s. Because of this, people don't even like to use the word segregate in its neutral sense. But you could rightly say that new bicycle lanes are designed to segregate bikes from auto traffic.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3456,"<ul><li>Subject can mean ""topic,"" as in ""Let's change the subject."" It can also mean ""to make someone do something,"" as in ""Don't let your dad subject you to an hour-long lecture on fishing."" It can also mean everyone in a country who is not the ruler, as in ""The king greeted his subjects when he returned from abroad.""</li><li>A subject could be a broad branch of knowledge, like Biology, or a very narrow focus, like the effects of drought on avocados. If you are painting a portrait, the person posing for you is your subject. Subject can also mean beholden, or subordinate. If you are traveling in England, but not an English subject, or citizen, then you are still subject to English law.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3457,"<ul><li>To testify is to make a statement or provide evidence, usually in court. Witnesses testify for the prosecution or defense.</li><li>If you've ever seen a TV show about lawyers, you've probably seen someone testifying: putting their hand on the Bible, sitting in the witness seat, and telling what they know about a case. Testifying is serious business, but it doesn't always happen in court: If someone knows you're good at math, they can testify to your math skills. Or if you've been to a restaurant, you can testify to your friends that it has awesome desserts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3458,"<ul><li>If a principal steps into a classroom and is greeted by a tumult of voices, with the teacher shouting for his kids' attention, she will not be pleased. A tumult is a state of noisy confusion.</li><li>Very often a crowd of people will cause a tumult. But your mind can also be in tumult, when you're confused and overwhelmed by strong emotions. If you want an adjective to describe these types of bewildering situations, use tumultuous. Tumult is from the Latin tumultus, ""an uproar,"" which is related to the Latin verb tumēre, ""to be excited.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3459,"<ul><li>To underestimate is to guess that something is worth less or is smaller than it really is. You might underestimate the size of a one-pound hamburger until you realize it's too big to fit in your stomach.</li><li>When you ""estimate"" you take a guess at something, and when you underestimate, your guess falls short or below. If you underestimate how much something costs, you might show up at a store without enough money, and if you underestimate the strength of an opponent who is small, you might find yourself on the ground wondering what hit you. Often when we ""assume"" something, we make a guess based on how things appear — that's one way to underestimate.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U23_3460,"<ul><li>Any kind of noisy disturbance can be called an uproar. A large group of political protesters outside City Hall is likely to create an uproar.</li><li>There's often an uproar in the audience of a rock concert when the band first appears on stage — people cheer and applaud and whistle. An announcement that the neighborhood donut shop is out of donuts could create another kind of uproar, especially if people have been standing in a long line dreaming of crullers and chocolate glazed donuts. Uproar comes from the German Aufruhr, ""a stirring up.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3461,"<ul><li>Accelerate means to speed up. A car accelerates when you step on the gas. You can accelerate the process of getting a visa if you happen to know someone who works in the consulate.</li><li>The fastest Amtrak trains are called the Acela line, a made-up word intended to suggest accelerate and therefore communicate that these trains are fast. If you are standing close to one when it zooms by, you may find yourself having an accelerated heart rate — they move pretty fast!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3462,"<ul><li>When something happens anew, it happens again, but in a fresh way that might be different.</li><li>Anew is a word to describe things that happen again but are more than just a rerun. If a couple takes their marriage vows anew, it's a little different than the first time. If a clothes trend happens anew, it's a revival of the original trend that probably won't be identical. This word applies to renewals and fresh starts of many kinds, though not always positive ones. Romances and barfights could both begin anew.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3463,"<ul><li>A flaw in something is a defect. At certain stores you can buy clothes with slight defects. You have to be careful because the defect can be minor, like a missing button, or major, like sleeves of uneven lengths.</li><li>In a person, a defect is an imperfection, which can manifest itself mentally or physically. If you are diagnosed with a heart defect, you will have to seek the advice of specialists. A hearing defect might leave your dad deaf in one ear. If you are becoming forgetful, you can joke that you are developing a mental defect, but if it continues, you'll probably want to have your head examined.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3464,"<ul><li>When something is dreary it's depressing or lifeless in a rainy-day way. I finished my work, there was nothing on TV, and the rain just wouldn't stop: what a dreary day!</li><li>Dreary can refer to a feeling, a place, a time, or even a thing. It sounds a little like a combination of ""drizzle"" and ""teary,"" and that's not a bad way to remember what it means. My grandmother's house was a dreary affair: run down, poorly lit, and silent but for the buzz of the fluorescent light in the cramped kitchen. Some might call the recession a depression: I call it dreary, either way. If the economy remains dreary like this much longer, I just might move to China.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3465,"<ul><li>Duplicate describes something that's an exact copy. If you tend to accidentally lock yourself out of your car, it's a good idea to carry a duplicate key with you just in case.</li><li>The word duplicate is useful when you're talking about a copy of something, like a duplicate of your birth certificate that you keep in a file, or a duplicate driver's license that you apply for after losing the original one. The verb duplicate is pronounced differently, with a long a sound, and it means to make a copy of or to multiply times two. The Latin root, duplicatus, means ""to double.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U24_3467,"<ul><li>If you take chemistry, you will learn about electrons. Electrons are the smallest of the particles that make up an atom, and they carry a negative charge.</li><li>The number of protons and electrons is equal in a neutral atom. The hydrogen atom, for example, has just one electron and one proton. The uranium atom, on the other hand, has 92 protons, and therefore, 92 electrons. An electron is so small that it cannot be seen with the naked eye, but neither can the atom itself.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3468,"<ul><li>To glide is to sail or skate with ease across a surface. Your favorite thing about winter might be watching the skaters in the park glide silently on the ice-covered lake.</li><li>A sled glides down a snowy hill, and a kayak glides across a silvery pond. Another way to glide is to soar in the air: your paper airplane, if you make it the right way, will glide all the way across the room, and a hawk can glide through the sky without seeming to move its wings. A different kind of glide is linguistic, a sound that's pronounced like a vowel but functions as a consonant.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3469,"<ul><li>Something ingenious shows creativity and inventiveness. If someone compares you to Einstein, they're implying that you, too, are ingenious.</li><li>Ingenious comes from the Latin words for inborn talent. It started off meaning someone who was talented or incredibly smart, but has come to mean ""inventive"" or ""clever."" If you could calculate how long a given water supply would last during a drought in your head, people might call you a math genius. But if you can come up with a solution to solve all water shortage issues during a drought, you will be praised as ingenious. Ingenious can also describe an object, like an ingenious device.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3470,"<ul><li>An innovation is the introduction of something new. If you run a magazine about new technology, then you're constantly looking out for the next innovation.</li><li>Innovation comes from Latin innovare for renew, whose root is novus or new. It can be used for either the act of introducing something new, as in a company that rewards creativity and innovation, or something that is newly introduced, like an innovation in microchip design. It was once used politically in the sense of revolution, but now you're most likely to hear it in relation to technology, or new ways of doing something.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3471,"<ul><li>Something innovative is new and original. If you love to experiment and find new ways to do things, you are an innovative person.</li><li>Innovative, like nova, novel, and novice, comes from the Latin novus, which means new. Something innovative renews or alters the way something has been done. You can use innovative to describe the thing or the person that made it. If your English teacher objects to your experimental writing style, tell him, ""I'm an innovative writer making innovative sentences!"" Antonyms are unoriginal and hackneyed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3472,"<ul><li>To launch something is to propel it or get it going, usually from a standing position. You can launch a rocket, a career, a product or even a watermelon. Either way, you're getting it off the ground.</li><li>Launch often means to start something, but to start it in a big way: ""The launch of the shuttle was also the launch of a new era in space travel."" Time was, when a singer finished making her record, the company would simply ""release it."" Eventually, though, that wasn't enough. Now a record needs ""a launch"" — a full-scale media blitz to get people excited enough to buy it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3473,"<ul><li>Something that's meteorological is related to the weather or changes in the Earth's atmosphere. If you're interested in a meteorological career, it means you'd like to be a meteorologist — a weather expert.</li><li>Meteorological events include things like fog, rain, tornadoes, and hurricanes. They are all caused by meteorological changes and shifts: in the temperature, air pressure, and amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. The word meteorological comes from the Greek root meteorologia, ""discussion of high things,"" from meteor-, ""thing high up,"" and logia, ""the study of.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3474,"<ul><li>When the weather man tells you it's going to rain today, he is giving a meteorology report, or weather forecast. Meteorology is the study of our atmosphere.</li><li>Meteorology comes from the Greek meteōrologia meaning ""of the atmosphere."" While meteorology involves various branches including aviation and agricultural studies, most commonly we see it in our everyday lives through weather forecasting, a process that involves collecting data about an atmosphere to determine what the weather will be. If you're fascinated by storms and hurricanes, consider a career in meteorology.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3475,"<ul><li>To penetrate is to force into or pierce through. If the fog is thick as pea soup, your flashlight won’t penetrate it. If you stubbornly ignore good advice, people might say nothing can penetrate that thick skull of yours.</li><li>We get penetrate from the Latin word penetrare, which combines penes (""within"") and intrare (""to enter""). Penetrate crops up most often to describe entering or permeating. Blaring music penetrated every corner of the dorm and we wondered how anyone could study with that racket. Penetrate can also mean to decipher or understand: ""Careful study allowed us to penetrate the mysteries of Pig Latin."" Finally — no surprise, given its Latin roots — the word can be used to describe sexual intercourse.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3476,"<ul><li>If something is persistent, it just won't stop. If you're persistent in your suggestions for a trip to Mexico, maybe your parents will eventually give in and take you there.</li><li>Persistent comes from the Latin verb persistere which means ""to continue with strength."" A persistent salesman refuses to give up. A persistent ringing sound is one that repeats and repeats. Persistent rumors keep circulating, as does a persistent virus. Often something persistent is annoying. The related verb is persist, which means to continue to exist, or to go without stopping.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3477,"<ul><li>The act of moving something forward is called propulsion. Propulsion is the force that pushes a rocket into space, that sends a football spiraling toward a receiver's hands, and that moves a strongly kicking swimmer through the water.</li><li>The noun propulsion came from the Latin prōpellere, ""to push away."" The modern meaning of propulsion meaning ""the act of moving forward"" was first recorded in 1799. In water, flippers, fins, and the wind can aid propulsion. In a general sense, if society is to move forward, we must stop using fossil fuels as our main means of propulsion.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3478,"<ul><li>When you simulate something, you imitate it. Hollywood makeup artists can use pencils and gray wigs to simulate old age in a young actor. It can also mean to model — a computer can simulate disaster scenarios in cities.</li><li>If you really admire someone's calm-under-pressure attitude, you may try to simulate their demeanor. When opening a present, it's polite to simulate surprise and excitement about the gift item, even if you already have it or it is ugly as dirt. Don't try to simulate your parents' signatures on excuse cards, though — signatures are unique to individuals and impossible to simulate perfectly.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3479,"<ul><li>To spur something on is to get it going, to encourage it, to hasten it or stimulate. Cowboys wear spiky metal tools called spurs on their boots to kick their horses and spur them to greater speed.</li><li>Economists talk of lowering interest rates to spur spending. A new source of funding for research will hopefully spur new proposals for research from scientists. An earthquake in China might spur cities in California to a higher standard of earthquake preparedness. You might spur your team on to victory by cheering from the sidelines.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U24_3480,"<ul><li>If the economy is starting to stall, the president can't just sit there. He has to stimulate—turn it on, bring it to life, perk it up. You can stimulate practically anything: a person, a conversation, a mind, or even the growth of a plant.</li><li>Stimulate is often used to describe a physical or sexual sensation, but don't get bogged down in that kind of thinking. Often, a government will try to stimulate economic activity by creating a stimulus package. Or, say, for example, that I'm trying to sell my new song CD. In order to stimulate interest, I need to send out a sample song to all my friends. Unless, of course, my songs are no good.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U25_3483,"<ul><li>Centigrade is a unit for measuring temperature, based on the properties of water.  The centigrade scale goes from zero to one hundred, where zero is the point where water freezes, and one hundred is when water boils.</li><li>Centigrade is also called Celsius, but it’s never called Fahrenheit — because that’s a totally different measurement of temperature.  Break centigrade down to its Latin roots: centum (meaning “a hundred”) and gradus (meaning “steps""). There are one hundred steps in the centigrade scale, see?  There is a way to convert centigrade to Fahrenheit, but this is vocabulary not mathematics; you’re on your own with that.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3484,"<ul><li>To chatter is to talk lightly or casually — to shoot the breeze or chitchat. You might chatter with your workmates about the weather or where you'll eat lunch.</li><li>You probably chatter with your friends all the time without even thinking about it, gossiping or talking about unimportant things. You can call the talk itself chatter too: ""The chatter in the cafeteria was so loud I couldn't hear myself think."" In the 13th century, it was chateren, from an imitative Middle English root.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3485,"<ul><li>A concerto is a classical music composition that highlights a solo instrument against the background of a full orchestra. Bach is one composer known for writing concertos.</li><li>In a concerto, a piano, violin, flute, or other instrument plays solo parts that are backed up or highlighted by an orchestra. Most concertos have three sections or movements, and in the 19th century they were especially popular as a way to showcase virtuoso playing by the soloist. In Italian, concerto means ""concert or harmony,"" from concertare, ""to bring into agreement.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3486,"<ul><li>When you condense something, you cut it down and trim it. You may love every word of your 1000-page novel, but you'll have to condense the plot into a 2-page summary for your editor.</li><li>When you condense something, you make it smaller and more compact. If you condense your wardrobe, you get rid things and keep only what you wear most. When a gas or vapor turns to liquid, it condenses. When you take a long, hot shower, the steam condenses in your bathroom, your mirror clouds up, and everything gets damp. Condense comes from Latin con-, “completely” and densus, “thick, dense.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3487,"<ul><li>When something gets worse due to neglect or an unfortunate health problem, stuff starts to deteriorate — or fall apart.</li><li>The word deteriorate describes anytime something gets worse. Due to neglect, a relationship can deteriorate but so can the American highway system. Sadly, there seems to be no end to applications for the word deteriorate. And, the truth is at a certain age we all start deteriorating too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3488,"<ul><li>A unit of measurement, degree describes the level, intensity or seriousness of something. So that hot coffee may not have caused 3rd degree burns, but it still took a good degree of self-control not to scream when you sipped it.</li><li>You could say there are many degrees of appropriate usage for the noun degree. In education, it's what you earn from a college or university after passing all the right courses. When it comes to temperature, you can put your degrees into Celsius or Fahrenheit. And if you're stuck in geometry class, you'll be spending lots of time talking about the 360 degrees in a circle or the 90 degrees in a right angle.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3489,"<ul><li>Something that's exterior is on the outside of some structure or object. An exterior door on a house opens to the outdoors, rather than connecting one room to another.</li><li>Exterior house paint is made for painting the shingles or siding of your home, not the walls of your living room, and the exterior finish of a car is on the outside. You can also use exterior as a noun, to mean the outside of something: ""The exterior of this salad bowl is a weird shade of yellow."" Exterior is a Latin word, a comparative of exterus, ""on the outside, outward, or foreign.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3490,"<ul><li>Hearty describes abundant, full, and satisfying things, and lively, strong, and enthusiastic people. A bowl of thick chili with cheese and a glass of milk is hearty. A spoon of water with a grape? Not so hearty.</li><li>You can't miss the ""heart"" in hearty. Words like ""wholehearted"" and ""half-hearted"" also have ""heart"" and are a help in remembering the adjective hearty. If you put your whole heart into anything from walking a dog to saying good morning to your friends, you're hearty and full of life. Something half-hearted is weak and not hearty.  A loud laugh that fills a room is very hearty; you can almost feel its fullness. If it comes from the heart and adds well-being and happiness, it's probably hearty.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3491,"<ul><li>When someone makes you feel comfortable and at home, that person is being hospitable, providing a warm, friendly environment. Anything hospitable is welcoming and open.</li><li>A Greek proverb suggested that in being hospitable, the main feeling should be good will. The basis for the word hospitable is the Latin hospes, which refers to welcoming a guest, a word that evolved into  meaning ""to entertain."" Consider that being hospitable means, as someone once said, “making your guests feel at home, even though you wish they were.” In other words, entertaining them. (You can also “entertain” new ideas with an open, hospitable mind.)</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3492,"<ul><li>Humor is a word for the quality of being funny — or for appreciating comedy, as in ""sense of humor.""</li><li>Many movies and TV shows — comedies — are full of humor, but there might be humor in any show or even any situation. Since different people find different things funny, there are many different senses of humor and types of humor. Some like wordplay, while others might enjoy slapstick. If you're in good humor, you're in a good mood. The humors are also the liquid parts of the body (you might remember that because many people find bodily fluids humorous).</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3493,"<ul><li>A manor is the house of a lord — pretty fancy stuff. If you like to read 18th-century British novels, you probably read about a lot of people having dinner, dance, and restrained romance in their manors.</li><li>Manor comes from the Old French manoir, meaning ""dwelling place,"" but a manor isn't just any old dwelling place. In the days when people still had titles of nobility, the houses and the grounds of the nobles were known as manors. If you tell someone that his house is a manor, that's like saying it's so opulent and lovely that it could have belonged to a lord.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3494,"<ul><li>A monastery is the building where monks live while they’re practicing their religion.  Some monasteries are occupied by hundreds of monks, and sometimes only one monk lives there all alone.</li><li>Christians have a church, Jews have a synagogue, and monks have a monastery, which serves not only as their holy place of worship, but also where they eat and sleep.  You’ll use the word mostly when referring to monks, but there are some monasteries for Catholic nuns.  The Greek word monastērion means “a place to live alone,” and monks and nuns go to a monastery to focus on their religion in isolation, away from the rest of the world.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3495,"<ul><li>In a nursery, you're going to find a lot of growth — and either babies or plants.</li><li>The word nurse is a clue to the meaning of nursery: nurses take care of people, and a nursery is a place of caretaking. One kind of nursery is for babies: it's a child's room with a crib and lots of baby toys. The other kind of nursery is for plants: this type of nursery usually has glass walls and a roof, plus everything plants need to be healthy. Nurseries keep plants or babies safe so they can grow.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U25_3497,"<ul><li>A parcel is a part of something, or a division. It can also be a package or a collection of things wrapped together.</li><li>Parcel comes from the Anglo-Norman word for ""part."" Often when we use parcel to mean a part, we're talking about land, which is divided into definable (and purchasable) tracts. As a verb, parcel means to divide something into parts, just as after trick-or-treating you might parcel your candy stash into piles of chocolates, peppermints, or toffees. If you're selling the family farm, you might parcel it into four small plots.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3498,"<ul><li>If a magazine editor asks you to write a profile of an up-and-coming novelist, she's asking you to write a biographical sketch, to give the readers a sense of the novelist as a person.</li><li>Profile comes from the Italian profilo, the thin colored border of cloth that outlines a garment. It came to mean any kind of sketch or outline, especially of faces. If someone compliments your profile means you look nice from the side (try outlining from other angles). If you have a criminal profile, your criminal record creates a picture of an active life of crime. A profile is also a drawing of the earth in cross-section, showing layers of crust.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3499,"<ul><li>Use the adjective winding to describe something with twists and turns, like a winding country road or a little winding mountain stream.</li><li>A path through the woods that has plenty of bends and curves in it is winding, and a river that curls and meanders down to the sea is also winding. The Beatles song ""The Long and Winding Road"" describes a twisting, indirect road. Winding has an Old English root, the word windan, which means ""to turn, twist, or wind.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U25_3500,"<ul><li>To zip is to close with a zipper. Also, zip means zilch, which is zero or nothing. Make sure to zip your wallet because if everything falls out, you’ll have zip.</li><li>Zip as in “to close with a zipper” is short for — you guessed it — zipper. If you're cold, zip up your coat. If you zip your lips, you’re not using a zipper but you’re closing your mouth. Zip meaning “nothing” came from kids in the 1900s when they referred to getting a zero on a test. Now, if you have zip, you have nothing, and not just on a test.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3501,"<ul><li>To abolish is to get rid of or annul. So when the principal yells at you for the 100th time for not having your shirt tucked in, it's safe to wish they'd just abolish the silly dress code.</li><li>The word abolish might stir up some historical connotations, since in the U.S. it's commonly associated with bringing an end to slavery. In fact, those who opposed slavery were called ""abolitionists."" The word comes to us from the Latin word abolere, meaning ""to destroy or cause to die out."" These days abolish is used to bring a final and official-sounding end to laws, codes, and unsavory practices.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3502,"<ul><li>When you amend something, you correct or improve it. If you confused your audience when you gave your speech, don't be afraid to amend what you said.</li><li>Amend can also describe adding amendments to an official document, such as a constitution or law. If politicians in your state want to address the growing number of home foreclosures, they might amend the state constitution to include restrictions intended to reduce foreclosures. Amend comes from the Latin word emendare, meaning ""to correct, free from fault.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3503,"<ul><li>Does your life goal include world domination? Have an ambitious plan that involves gold medals and international fame? Then you definitely know what it means to aspire toward something big.</li><li>The verb aspire commonly means to aim or shoot for. But it comes from the Latin word aspirare, which means “to breathe upon.” So here's a trick for remembering this word: Think of yourself reaching up towards a spire, that really tall, tapered structure at the top of a church. Or, if you’re in a poetic mood, imagine your wish as a feather that moves forward when you blow on it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3504,"<ul><li>A censor takes out things that are objectionable or inappropriate, like the censors at the TV networks bleeping out all the bad words in a show.</li><li>To put it simply, a censor judges. Originating in the 1530’s, a censor was originally a Roman magistrate who took censuses and oversaw public morals. Censors today are hired by TV stations, publishers and the government to examine books, films and other material and strip out or flag all the amoral, offensive or otherwise bad stuff. Thankfully, in the U.S. free speech usually wins out over censorship.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3505,"<ul><li>What do rock gods do when they travel? They charter their own plane, of course. Charter means you rent or lease a particular service or object. Anyone can charter something, though lesser mortals tend to limit themselves to buses.</li><li>Charter comes from the Latin charta, meaning ""paper, card or map."" As a noun, charter refers to a written document outlining — or mapping — the rights and obligations of a company or organization, or even, in older days, a town or entire colony. New York City was given a charter, for example, by the British monarch in the 17th century, guaranteeing it certain rights in exchange for goods and services. Today corporations still have charters governing their behavior.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3506,"<ul><li>A constitution is a statement of the basic principles and laws of a nation, state, or group, such as the U.S. Constitution. Another very common meaning of constitution is the physical makeup of a person.</li><li>The noun constitution is from Latin, from constitutus, ""set up, established,"" plus the suffix -ion, meaning ""act, state, or condition."" So think of a constitution as how a body (yours, the government's) is set up. If you have a strong constitution, it means you don't get sick very often.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3507,"<ul><li>Your Aunt Eleanor, who's lived in six different countries and speaks four languages fluently, might be described as cosmopolitan, or comfortable and familiar with different cultures and people.</li><li>People who are cosmopolitan have an air of glamour surrounding them, a sense that they've seen a lot of the world and are sophisticated and at ease with all different kinds of people. Places can also be described as cosmopolitan, meaning ""diverse,"" or bustling with lots of people of varying nationalities. Any way you use it, cosmopolitan implies a sophistication, which might explain why both a well-known alcoholic cocktail and a famous women's magazine are both named after the word cosmopolitan.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3508,"<ul><li>Disseminate means to spread information, knowledge, opinions widely. Semin- derives from the Latin word for seed; the idea with disseminate is that information travels like seeds sown by a farmer.</li><li>Think about a teacher distributing a hand out at the beginning of a class. The dis-  of disseminate and distribute come from the same Latin prefix which means ""apart, in a different direction."" But unlike papers distributed in class, information, once spread around in all directions, cannot be pulled back in. Think about false rumors or political smear campaigns and you'll understand that dissemination is usually a one-way process.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3509,"<ul><li>When you flatter someone, you praise and compliment him or her — but you aren't totally sincere. You flatter your friend by telling her she's the best driver in the world. Because you want her to offer you a ride.</li><li>The Old French flater originally meant ""to stroke or caress,"" which is what you do to people's egos when you flatter them. When you flatter, you probably want something — it could be as simple as wanting someone to like you. That's why people who meet celebrities tell them they're the greatest. More positively, if your hairstyle flatters your face, it emphasizes your best features.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3510,"<ul><li>Someone who is infamous has a very bad reputation. If you become a Hollywood star and find yourself on the pages of gossip magazines for your affairs and addictions, you will have succeeded in becoming infamous.</li><li>Infamous is from Latin infamis, for negative fame. If you're bad but unknown, then you're not infamous — it's reserved for those wicked and well-known people that capture our collective imagination.  It is a strong and resonant term. Some synonyms are notorious, disgraceful, and odious. The stress is on the first syllable.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3511,"<ul><li>You might describe a limping dog that's lost the use of one of its legs as lame, which means ""disabled in a leg or foot.""</li><li>It's less common than describing injured animals as lame, but sometimes you'll hear the word lame used to describe a limping person too. This usage is generally considered to be outdated or inappropriate. Lame is probably most often used to mean generally weak or pathetic — but many people consider this usage to be offensive as well.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3512,"<ul><li>If you walk unevenly, you have a limp. Maybe you pulled your hamstring at the annual Thanksgiving Day Football Showdown, or maybe one leg is three inches shorter than the other. Whatever the reason, if your gait is off kilter, you limp.</li><li>You can have a limp (the noun), or you can limp (the verb), and both mean that for some reason your legs don’t work quite in synch. Limp can also be an adjective that means ""not strong or firm,"" like your friends' limp response to your invitation to come help paint your house or when your hair looks limp, meaning it's just hanging, with no volume or style.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3513,"<ul><li>When you can't help an angry shout or a burst of emotion, that's an outburst. A toddler's outburst might take the form of a full-blown temper tantrum.</li><li>An outburst of passion or emotion can be angry words, a broken glass, or a triumphant whoop. There are also figurative outbursts, like the outburst of political enthusiasm within a particular group of voters, or an outburst of energy in the midst of a modern dance performance. The Middle English verb that proceeded outburst was outbresten.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3514,"<ul><li>If something is caused by a physical or mental disease, it is pathological. Someone with a pathological compulsion for cleanliness might scrub the floors for hours every night.</li><li>Pathological comes from a Greek word, pathologikos, which means “treating of diseases” — pathos means ""suffering."" Anyone who studies or works with diseases, from their causes to their symptoms, identifies how the disease affects its victims, in other words, its pathological effects. Remember that this is a medical distinction. If a person has, for example, obsessive-compulsive disorder, his or her repetitive actions are pathological.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3515,"<ul><li>If you think something is amazing, astounding, or marvelous, you can also call it phenomenal. Your dog's phenomenal performance at the agilty competition earned her a blue ribbon — and a handful of biscuits.</li><li>Phenomenal things aren't just cool — they're truly remarkable and possibly even unique. Your sister's campaign to raise money for cancer research, which amassed a million dollars in two weeks? That's phenomenal. And Serena Williams, having won an unprecedented 23 Grand Slam titles, is without question a phenomenal tennis player. This extraordinary word comes from the relatively ordinary Greek phainomenon, ""appearance,"" and its Proto-Indo-European root bha-, ""to shine.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3516,"<ul><li>A poll is an election, or a survey of people's opinions. When people go to the polls, they vote.</li><li>If you poll your classmates about their favorite foods, you survey them and take note of their opinions — in other words, they each cast a vote. This is also what happens when voters go to the polls, although they're voting for political candidates and their votes are anonymous. The original fourteenth century meaning of poll was ""hair on the head"" or just ""head."" This gradually evolved into ""person,"" and the idea of ""counting heads.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3517,"<ul><li>Remorse, a noun, is what you feel if you regret your actions or wish for another outcome.</li><li>The noun remorse has a very vivid origin. It comes from the Latin roots re  for ""again"" and mordere ""to bite."" So, if you feel remorse, it means that your conscience is working on you, your past actions are biting you back, and making you feel very regretful. Synonyms for this word are ""penitence,"" ""rue,"" and ""contrition."" If you took a cookie from the cookie jar and ate it you can't return it; all you can feel is remorse for what you did!</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3518,"<ul><li>Secrecy is a word for a state or condition where things are concealed or hidden. CIA agents and conspirators know a lot about secrecy.</li><li>Since a secret is something some people don't know, secrecy is all about keeping things private or concealed. Being a spy involves a lot of secrecy. When information is important or sensitive, people try to create secrecy. Also, you can say secrecy is a quality people have, like courage. Someone who doesn't gossip has a good sense of secrecy. When all lips are sealed, there's secrecy.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3519,"<ul><li>To tackle a challenge means taking it on, so if you set out to tackle the classics of English literature, you should be prepared spend a lot of time in the library.</li><li>The word tackle can be a verb or a noun, depending on its use. Today, the noun usually means fishing gear, but when it came into the English language it meant the ropes on a ship. If a ship was lurching about on the high seas, you dealt with that challenge by grabbing the tackle and wrestling it under control. Nowadays, people tend to think of tackling running backs and financial fraud, rather than ropes.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U26_3520,"<ul><li>If your eyes are open but you're not fully awake and in control, you may be in trance. Someone might have hypnotized you, or just a glimpse of your latest heartthrob might send you into a trance.</li><li>Trances don’t have to be magic or mysterious — when you avoid facing your problems head-on, you’re creating your own trance. President Obama once said, speaking of America's decades-long dependence on foreign oil, ""We cannot keep going from shock when prices go up, to trance when they go back down."" He meant that when prices rise, we all complain, but when they fall, we forget we ever had a problem and refuse to change a thing.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3521,"<ul><li>A coward is someone who’s afraid of doing something daring or dangerous. Skydiving might sound exciting in theory, but you might be a coward when it comes to actually jumping out of a plane. Which is probably wise.</li><li>Coward comes from the Latin word couda, meaning “tail.” Have you ever seen a scared puppy with its tail between its legs? That’s what people who are cowards would be doing if they had tails. Being afraid of something dangerous might make someone a coward, but the word can also describe someone who avoids doing something difficult or unpleasant. If your boss makes his assistant deliver the unpleasant news about layoffs, you might call him a coward.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3522,"<ul><li>The author looked at the computer screen in horror. With one keystroke she had deleted  her entire manuscript. Delete means to erase.</li><li>Delete has its roots in Latin and was first used to mean destroy. In modern usage, delete means to remove completely. Delete used in writing means to edit by removing, often done by drawing a line through the text to be deleted . This process is also called “blue-penciling,” due to the use of the blue colored pencil that some editors use.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3523,"<ul><li>If you are earnest, it means you are serious about something. Your parents might not want you to drop out of school to follow some fly-by-night dream, but if you're earnest about wanting a career in show biz, they'll support you.</li><li>If you are earnest, you pursue your purpose in a steady, sincere, and eager way. The phrase in earnest uses earnest as a noun, as in, ""Once you stop fooling around and start studying in earnest, you'll find you learn the material quickly."" Oscar Wilde's classic play The Importance of Being Earnest plays on the fact that Ernest is also a man's name.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3524,"<ul><li>An ethnic group encompasses a group of people with a unique culture. People from Bosnia form an ethnic group called Bosnians, and they share common cultural traditions, which often focus on hospitality and family.</li><li>The word ethnic comes from the Greek ethnos, ""nation,"" ""people."" Groups of people from specific areas who share the same or similar customs are ethnic groups. People who resettle in other countries often bring their distinctive traditions with them, including language, food, lifestyle, and music. There are ethnic restaurants, shops, and neighborhoods around the world, including Indian buffets, Italian shoe makers, and Greek Towns and China Towns.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3525,"<ul><li>Exclude means to leave out — like when the cool kids won't let you in on their game of four-square or the pizza guy leaves your neighborhood out from his delivery zone.</li><li>Exclude comes to us from the Latin word excludere, which means ""to shut."" So essentially, when you exclude someone you slam the door in their face one way or another: You won't let them into the party, you leave them off the invite list, or refuse to include them in the conversation once they arrive. Needless to say, excluding others is not very nice.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3526,"<ul><li>Anything firsthand is directly experienced, so your firsthand knowledge of the new math teacher's purple hair comes from the fact that you've seen it with your very own eyes.</li><li>When you get information from someone who saw something happen or heard something said, that's firsthand evidence. And anything you see or hear yourself is also firsthand. Your summer job might be a firsthand look at what farming is really like. Interviewing a witness to a crime gives a police officer firsthand testimony about what exactly happened. This word, coined around 1690, comes from the idea that the maker of something is its first hand.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3527,"<ul><li>To be fluent in something — like a language or an instrument — is to be able to use it smoothly and effortlessly.</li><li>It takes many years and lots of practice to become fluent in a second language. But when you're finally fluent, you can understand it, speak it, and write easily in it. One French class won't make you fluent — gaining fluency takes years. You can also be fluent in other things that you've practiced and mastered, like cello or computer programming. If you're doing something in a way that makes it look easy, you're fluent.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3528,"<ul><li>Imperial carries the implication of royalty, usually pertaining to an empire; the emperor or empress is referred to as ""your imperial highness.""</li><li>The word imperial has a lofty feel, and though it's often used of royalty, it is sometimes used to refer to anything extremely large or impressive. It was once the name of a large suitcase that was too big to fit inside a coach and so was tied on top. Think of something imperial as being something so upper-class that it's almost to the point of royalty — and sometimes almost to the point of being a joke.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3529,"<ul><li>Call something inclusive when it's designed or inclined to include. An exclusive club might let you in, but an inclusive one will ask you to join, no strings attached.</li><li>Inclusive is an adjective with several meanings: It can be used to describe something that's broad or extensive, such as thorough, inclusive research project. Or it describes a group that's particularly welcoming to all kinds of people. And an inclusive range is one where the limits are included along with what lies in between: a survey of “20-40 year-olds, inclusive” tells us 20 and 40 year-olds were counted, too.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3530,"<ul><li>A legislature is a governing body that makes laws and can also amend or repeal them.</li><li>The word legislature comes from the Latin word for ""law"" — legis. In the US, each state has a legislature — made up of the elected state senators and assemblymen or women, or representatives. The US Congress is the national legislature. These bodies, whose members are often referred to as ""law-makers,"" make up the legislative branch of government, as distinct from the executive and judicial branches.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3531,"<ul><li>Use the adjective linguistic to describe anything related to language, like the linguistic difficulties you might have if you visit a place where you do not speak the same language as everyone else.</li><li>The word linguistic combines the noun linguist, meaning ""a master of language, one who uses his tongue freely,"" with the adjective suffix -ic. It describes something that’s related to language, such as a linguistic theory about why some people drop the g sound in saying words ending in -ing. Or, if you want to brag about how good your vocabulary is, then rave about your linguistic skills.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3532,"<ul><li>If you're monolingual, you speak just one language. If you are monolingual, your chances of landing a job as a translator are pretty darn slim.</li><li>Your whole family might be monolingual, while your best friend comes from a family that speaks Spanish at home and English at school — in other words, they're bilingual. Being monolingual can be limiting, since you can only communicate clearly with others who speak your language. Learning new languages and becoming bilingual (or even multilingual, speaking several languages) is also good for your brain. The Greek root mono means ""one,"" and the Latin lingua means ""tongue"" or ""language.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3533,"<ul><li>Your nationality is the country you come from: American, Canadian, and Russian are all nationalities.</li><li>Everyone has a gender, race, sexual orientation...and a nationality. A person's nationality is where they are a legal citizen, usually in the country where they were born. People from Mexico have Mexican nationality, and people from Australia have Australian nationality. People of the same nationality usually share traditions and customs, and they might look a little alike, too. Nationality is one of many qualities that bring people together.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3534,"<ul><li>A patriot is someone who loves and who has sometimes fought for his or her country. “Nathan Hale was a true patriot; his only regret was that he had but one life to give for his country.”</li><li>The word patriot comes from patrios (Greek, not Latin for once), which means ""of one’s father."" So, despite various references to the motherland, the word patriot more or less lands us square in the fatherland arena. And if you’re a football fan, the New England Patriots is a near-Boston-based team (Boston being a major source of American patriots in the Revolutionary War). And, if you want to get yourself in trouble, you can wander Boston with a megaphone chanting, “The Patriots stink.”</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3535,"<ul><li>To prosecute is to participate in or pursue something to completion, like a government’s intention to prosecute a war. Prosecute is most often used for bringing legal action against an accused person or group.</li><li>Prosecute comes from the Latin, “prosesutus,” meaning “follow after.” The legal sense of the word first appeared in the 1570s. A district attorney will often prosecute, by bringing legal charges and action against a person or group (watch any TV legal drama, and the prosecution will no doubt prosecute eventually). A company may prosecute by suing to protect against damages. Prosecute should not be confused with the word persecute, which means to harass or oppress.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3536,"<ul><li>Something racial is related to the characteristics people have because of their genetic or ethnic origins. Racial differences sometimes lead to racial tension.</li><li>Members of the same racial group share a very old genetic connection — their ancestors lived in the same part of the world, and they're distantly related. When people talk about ""racial diversity,"" they mean that many of these groups are represented, for example, in a single city. The noun race is at the heart of the adjective racial, and it comes from Old French, with an Italian root word, razza, ""race, breed, lineage, or family.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3537,"<ul><li>If you’ve ever attended a funeral, you were probably struck by how quiet, earnest, and solemn the mood was.  You can use the word solemn to describe anything that's really serious and dignified.</li><li>The adjective solemn comes from the Latin sollemnis, which means formal or ceremonial. You can still use it to describe a ceremony or event, but it's also a good word for talking about someone who's serious and sincere and maybe lacks a sense of humor about certain things.  Here's a trick for remembering it: Think of a ""sole man,"" a serious guy standing alone at a party talking to no one.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3538,"<ul><li>When you see a group of citizens protesting something on the news, marching in a group, holding signs, and chanting slogans, you know they are in solidarity with each other, or united behind a common goal or purpose.</li><li>Any time you express support of a group or the people in it, you're showing solidarity with them. The word is used most often to describe a sense of unity with a political group, a group of striking workers, or people who have been deprived of their rights in some way. You might show your own solidarity by signing a petition, joining in a protest, or simply flashing a thumbs up.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3539,"<ul><li>To talk carefully without hurting anyone’s feelings, that’s tact.  Politicians have tact, which makes them good at speaking about sensitive matters without making fools of themselves.  At least, sometimes they have tact.</li><li>Around a friend who’s afraid of snakes, you use tact when talking about reptiles because you don’t want to upset them.  The Latin root word tangere means “touch,” and a person with tact avoids touching dangerous words like they are an electric fence.  When you say something without tact, you “put your foot in your mouth,” as the phrase goes.  You don’t literally put your foot in your mouth, although if you did you’d avoid offending people with words.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U27_3540,"<ul><li>To undermine literally means to dig a hole underneath something, making it likely to collapse. But we more often use the word to describe sabotage or the act of weakening someone else's efforts.</li><li>Originally spelled with a ‘y’ instead of an ‘i’, undermine has Germanic roots and means ""to weaken, hinder, or impair."" Accidentally undermine the foundation of a house by digging a tunnel to China beneath it and you might be forgiven. Undermine your teacher’s authority by speaking out of turn and throwing spitballs and odds are you’ll get in trouble.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3541,"<ul><li>To constrain is to hold back, restrain, or confine. If you've ever had to constrain a toddler in the middle of a temper tantrum, you know you have to watch out for flailing limbs.</li><li>The verb constrain comes from the Latin word constringere, which means to bind together or tie tightly. Constrain can imply both literal and figurative bindings. You can constrain someone by physically holding on to something like a person's shirt. Or, you can figuratively constrain someone by putting up obstacles. Your teenagers, for example, may feel constrained by your rules and accuse you of sucking the fun out of their social lives.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3542,"<ul><li>A depot is a place where things are stored in large quantities for future use. Your office might have a depot in the back where supplies are stored.</li><li>Depot came into English from the French word dépôt, meaning ""a deposit, place of deposit."" A depot can be a place like a warehouse where items are temporarily deposited, but we also use it for a train or bus station. In this case, think of it as a place where a many passengers are being temporarily housed. Your bus trip might require you to get off one bus at a big depot, and transfer to another.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3543,"<ul><li>When you emulate someone, you imitate them, especially with the idea of matching their success.</li><li>When someone is impressive because of their great skills, brains, strength, or accomplishments, others will emulate them. To emulate is to imitate and model yourself after someone. People emulate role models — people they want to be like. After Michael Jordan retired from the NBA, player after player tried to emulate Jordan's game and success. It's hard to be as good as someone like that, but having a hero to emulate can be helpful in many areas of life.</li></ul>"

It's different from you being tall, rather than being a description, it has to be a quality and this quality is unchangeable. So, for example, if you have never been able to eat spinach, you have an inherent dislike of it.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3547,"<ul><li>You can see ""timid"" in the middle of intimidate, and to be timid is to be frightened or to pull back from something. When you intimidate, you frighten or make someone afraid. A pet rat might intimidate your sister's friends, keeping them out of your fort.</li><li>""To frighten"" or ""make fearful"" is at the root of the verb intimidate. An animal might intimidate a smaller animal by bearing its teeth, and a person can intimidate another by threatening to do something harmful. You can be intimidated with mental or emotional bullying, as well as with something physical: ""they were all good spellers, but some of them knew how to intimidate the competition into thinking they didn't have a chance at winning the spelling bee.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3548,"<ul><li>A janitor is someone whose job is cleaning and maintaining a building. If your school always looks clean and orderly, be sure to thank the janitor.</li><li>Another name for a janitor is a custodian, or in Britain, a caretaker. This job involves cleaning and caring for a school, hospital, apartment building, or workplace. Janitors may be responsible for cleaning bathrooms, hallways, and other common areas. Sometimes janitors will also sweep sidewalks, shovel snow, or do other outdoor maintenance. In the 16th century, a janitor was a ""doorkeeper,"" from the Latin ianitor, ""doorkeeper or porter,"" and the root ianua, ""door.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3549,"<ul><li>Moist things feel damp when you touch them — they're just a little bit wet. You might want to bring a blanket to sit on for a picnic, especially if it rained yesterday and the grass is still moist.</li><li>Your houseplants are happiest when their soil is moist, and cake is most delicious if it's a little moist, not dry and crumbly. You can also describe your friend's eyes full of tears as moist, or the air on a densely foggy morning as moist. For some reason, the word moist frequently shows up on lists of ""least favorite words,"" which makes more sense when you know its Latin root, muscidus — ""moldy"" or ""slimy.""</li></ul>"

Just hope the teacher doesn't use the kind of prod a rancher uses to keep cattle moving!</li><li>Prod can also be a verb that refers to a soft poke or a nudge, like when you prod someone in the ribs with your finger. It can also describe verbal encouragement that's used when you want something or want to know something. For example, you might prod your sister into helping you do your math homework.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3552,"<ul><li>If you’re ever kidnapped, you’d probably be worth millions in ransom. Ransom is the money demanded for the release of a captive.</li><li>You’ve probably heard the phrase “held for ransom.” That means someone has been captured and is being held prisoner until a sum of money is delivered to the captors. Ransom can refer to the money paid, but it can also be a verb that describes paying for the release of someone being held. If you have to ransom your best friend, that means you’re paying his captors to release him.</li></ul>"

Prison guards have to restrain a prisoner who is trying to attack one of his fellow inmates. That prisoner might even be put in handcuffs — a kind of restraint. You can restrain yourself, for example if you're watching a Broadway show and suddenly feel the urge to sing along. Your fellow audience members would be grateful for your restraint, especially if you've got a terrible voice.</li></ul>"

Generally speaking, it's rude to spit, particularly if you're at a fancy dinner party.</li><li>There are some parts of the world where it's socially acceptable to spit in public, and it was once accepted in most of the West too. During the Middle Ages, Western Europeans found it less polite to ""suck back"" spit than to, well, spit. And spittoons, receptacles for spitting in, were common until the early 20th century, when the influenza epidemic and public health campaigns about tuberculosis greatly reduced public spitting.</li></ul>"

You and your sister might sprint to the bus stop, racing to see who can get there first.</li><li>In the sport of track and field, a sprint is a short race that's run at top speed the whole way. Two professional cyclists also sprint when they race on bikes that start out side-by-side. If you notice a swarm of angry wasps heading your direction, you can sprint indoors, hoping you move faster than they do. Sprint has a Scandinavian root, possibly the Old Norse word spretta, ""to jump up.""</li></ul>"

Some people say that drinking coffee will stunt your growth when you're a teenager — they worry that you won't grow any taller.</li><li>Poor nutrition can stunt your growth, and bad soil will do the same for a plant — a lack of moisture or nutrients will stunt the development of your lettuce or tomatoes. Another meaning of stunt is a dangerous trick, the kind performed in an action movie or by planes in an air show. The root of ""check the growth"" is the Old English stunt, ""short witted or foolish,"" while the ""trick"" kind of stunt comes from nineteenth century American college slang.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3558,"<ul><li>If you're tolerant it means that you accept people who are unlike you or put up with stuff you don't like.  If you let your roommate play the same awful '80s mix over and over and don't say anything, you're probably a very tolerant person.</li><li>Broad-minded and open thinking is a hallmark of tolerant behavior. An individual can be tolerant, and so can a community or a nation if it accepts people from lots of different cultures or backgrounds.  We generally think of tolerance as a good thing, but that doesn't mean being tolerant is easy — not with so many family members, classmates, and colleagues around to annoy us.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3559,"<ul><li>Although traditionally used to refer to the bloodsucking undead, you can use the noun vampire to describe someone who heartlessly preys on others — a blackmailer, or anyone else who just sucks the life out of you.</li><li>Vampire first appeared as a word in English in the early 1700’s, but folklore surrounding undead creatures that feed off of human blood has been around since the earliest times. Among many supposed abilities, vampires are sometimes believed to be able to take the form of a bat. The word vampire is also used to refer to non-mythical “vampire bats” which are native to the Americas and really do feed on blood.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U28_3560,"<ul><li>The reflex that makes you open your mouth wide, inhale, and then exhale is called a yawn. Even seeing photos of other people's yawns (or reading the word yawn) can make you yawn.</li><li>We yawn when we're very bored or tired, or when our bodies need an influx of oxygen. Scientists aren't completely in agreement about all the reasons why we yawn, but the ""contagious yawn"" happens across all human societies and even in non-human animals like chimpanzees and dogs. Things can also yawn in a figurative way, when they're open wide. Yawn comes from gionian in Old English, ""open the mouth wide.""</li></ul>"

You might allege that your sister broke a vase, just because no one else was home when you heard the crash.</li><li>If you ever watch news programs, you often hear the verb allege. A reporter might say that detectives allege that a certain person, who is now being held without bail, set a fire. This can be confusing: If the person is in jail, then he or she must have set that fire, right? In reality, the person is a suspect, awaiting trial. In the United States, people are assumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.</li></ul>"

You may find this shape in a carefully tweezed eyebrow or in the famous golden pair that make you hunger for a Big Mac.</li><li>In architecture, an arch is an opening that is often found supporting the weight of a something above it — like a bridge or a wall. In downtown St. Louis, you can visit the Gateway Arch — a freestanding catenary arch that is 630 feet tall and 630 feet wide. As a verb, arch means to make an arch-like shape. ""She stretched her back by arching it into a backbend."" As an adjective, arch can describe something mischievous or sly: ""He teased his friend with an arch comment about his shyness around girls.""</li></ul>"

But casualty can also refer to deaths or injuries suffered in an accident or some other unfortunate event.</li><li>The term ""casualties of war"" has been around for a while and refers to the ugly downside of military victory. Anyone who loses life or limb, either in the fighting or as a civilian, is called a casualty. You can also use this word figuratively: if a local elementary school loses funding for their art classes and after-school activities, you can say that the students are casualties of budget cuts.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U29_3566,"<ul><li>Erect means ""build"" or ""upright."" If you erect a house, you build it. If you stand erect, you hold your body as tall as possible.</li><li>Erect comes from the Latin word erectus, meaning “upright, elevated, lofty” or “eager, alert, aroused.” Erect is a verb, as in, it will take you years to erect your replica of the Eiffel Tower using only gum and toothpicks.

As a verb, foul usually means “make dirty or messy.” You might foul your room to the point where it smells a bit foul.</li><li>In general, foul can be used as an adjective meaning ""bad."" Foul luck is bad luck; a foul day is a bad day. As a verb, foul can mean ""break the rules."" It’s used this way in sports, like when you commit a foul on the basketball court. The phrase ""foul play"" can be used in the context of sports or more generally, to indicate unfair or violent behavior. Avoid confusing foul with fowl, which refers to birds, especially chickens.</li></ul>"

If you want to heighten awareness about homelessness, you might write an article for your local newspaper.</li><li>Extreme weather can act to heighten people's concern about climate change, and publicity for a good cause can heighten awareness of the ways college students can volunteer their time. A movie director might heighten the tension in a scene by using scary music and dramatic lighting. In all of these cases, something is intensified or increased. The oldest, fifteenth-century meaning of heighten, however, was ""to exalt, honor, or raise to a high position.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U29_3570,"<ul><li>A reputation for hospitality means you're known for being kind and welcoming to visitors, which may also mean that you always have a full house at Thanksgiving.</li><li>Hospitalitem is a Latin word meaning ""friendliness to guests,"" so it's not hard to see where the word hospitality comes from. Showing hospitality involves making others feel comfortable and welcome in your home. If you're grumpy and prefer to be left alone, this word probably won't ever be used to describe you, nor are you likely headed for a career in the  hospitality industry.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U29_3571,"<ul><li>A mansion is a huge, fancy house. Some mansions are eventually turned into museums where you can get a look at an old wealthy family's art and furniture collections.</li><li>It takes a lot of money and a staff of workers to live in and take care of a mansion. Historically, post-fifteenth century European noblemen lived in mansions that became the typical style of home for aristocrats who no longer required the safety of fortified castles. The word mansion comes from the Latin root mansionem, ""a staying or a remaining,"" from the stem manere, ""to stay.""</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U29_3572,"<ul><li>To outnumber is to have more of one thing than another. Sometimes it’s good, like when chocolate chips outnumber the raisins in the trail mix. Sometimes it’s bad, like when ants outnumber the people at a picnic.</li><li>In many cities, pigeons seem to outnumber any other kind of bird — in other words, there are more pigeons than sparrows, crows, and robins. If the girls in a class outnumber boys by three to one, there are three times more girls than boys. And in a school cafeteria, lunches that include meat will often outnumber the vegetarian choices. This verb has been around since the 1600s. It makes it sound like counting is a competition.</li></ul>"

Pasture is both a noun and a verb associated with grazing animals.</li><li>As a noun, a pasture is a field where animals such as horses and cattle can graze, or feed. Pasture can also refer to the grasses or other plants that grow in a pasture. As a verb, pasture means ""to graze"" or ""to release animals into a pasture for grazing.""

If you write up a statement against the town's approval of a new carnival district and collect signatures from 100 neighbors to turn in to the city government, that's a petition. If you pray to the carnival gods to rain down ruin on the carnival, that's also a petition — and no signatures needed.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U29_3576,"<ul><li>To renovate means to renew or rebuild so that something is in good condition. When you move into an old house, you will probably want to renovate the kitchen and bathrooms.</li><li>Most usages of the word renovate revolve around buildings and architecture. During a generation change in a neighborhood, retired people move out and young families move in. They want to give new life to the old house they have bought so they renovate it by painting, redoing the floors, etc. If you renovate a historic building, you restore to its original splendor. Think of this sense of renewal if something renovates your spirits.</li></ul>"
4000EEW_B06_U29_3577,"<ul><li>To revise means to alter or improve a preliminary draft of something, usually a text. When you want your writing to be really great, you must revise it several times until it is perfect.</li><li>The word revise sounds like the related word revisit, and revising a piece of work does in fact require revisiting it. Planning out a project includes estimating how much it will cost and when it will be done. If something unforeseen happens, you might have to revise your estimates of cost and completion date. You can also use revise as a noun. Once you finish the first draft of an essay, you can begin working on the revise.</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U29_3580,"<ul><li>When you're walking on the perfect green grass of a golf course, you might remark on the gorgeous turf. Turf is the top layer of ground, especially when it's planted with grass.</li><li>From its original meaning, referring to the top layer of soil in which plants are rooted, turf has expanded to include a range of senses. While you might carefully maintain your beautiful backyard turf, your dog might think of it as his turf, barking to defend it from intruders. This sense of turf means ""range of influence,"" or territory. Both meanings of the word come from a Germanic root that originated in a Sanskrit word, darbha, ""blade of grass.""</li></ul>"

4000EEW_B06_U30_3584,"<ul><li>When something comprises other things, it is made up of them or formed from them. The periodic table comprises 118 elements, because the whole comprises the parts.</li><li>In its traditional use, the word comprise is the opposite of compose: if A comprises X, Y, and Z, then X, Y, and Z compose A. But because compose and comprise sound so much alike, people have long confused the two. So now you often hear things like ""The band is comprised of a guitarist, a bassist, and a hairy drummer,"" whereas sticklers would prefer ""is composed of"" in that sentence. The word is undergoing a usage shift, making it just as hairy as that drummer!</li></ul>"

So grab a crayon, a paint brush, or even an Etch-A-Sketch and start depicting.</li><li>From the Latin depictus, meaning “to portray, paint, sketch, describe,” depict is a way to communicate what you see. To explain to an alien what a banana is, you can either depict it with drawings, describe it in words, or both. But be careful.

If you have a dual major, it means you're majoring in two subjects, like astronomy and microbiology.</li><li>The adjective dual comes from the Latin duo, for two, and means having two parts. You can have a dual purpose, following two goals at once. To copilot an airplane, you need a cockpit with dual controls.

The scale is named for its inventor, a German physicist named Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, who developed it in 1724. Until the 1960s, Fahrenheit was the most widely-used scale for measuring temperature. Today, Americans using British recipes, for example, have to translate Celsius to Fahrenheit before setting their ovens.</li></ul>"

Paradoxical statements may seem completely self-contradictory, but they can be used to reveal deeper truths.

If you want to buy a European-made car in the U.S., the price will include tariffs the government adds to the price of imported vehicles.</li><li>Usually a government imposes a tariff to encourage its own industries and to discourage buying cheaper imports from other countries. If a government wants to protect its own clothing industry, it may add a tariff to imported clothing, to make sure that the imported clothes aren't cheaper than the locally manufactured items.

Thermometers measure temperatures in degrees, according to either the Celsius or Fahrenheit system.  Meteorologists use thermometers to find out how hot it is or if it's below freezing.

When Mavis and Marvin argue, you tend to tilt toward Marvin’s point of view, meaning you think he's probably right — you lean in that direction. As a noun tilt can mean a steep slant.

News stories about escaped prisoners or criminals on the run often mention that their whereabouts are unknown, and parents who like to keep tabs on a teenager's whereabouts sometimes buy her a cell phone.
