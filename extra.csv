(...) or so,
a matter of speculation,
solicitation,"<ul><li>Solicitation is a request for something, usually money. If you buy a fancy new house, expect a phone call from the local charity with a solicitation for a donation.</li><li>Solicitation comes from solicit, which means ""to request,"" or ""to entreat."" So solicitation is the act of requesting. There are three kinds of solicitation. One is asking for money, like when someone goes door-to-door trying to collect money for a cause. In law, solicitation means encouraging someone to commit a crime. Solicitation can also mean making a plea to someone with power to grant a request or favor, like your solicitation to the traffic judge to dismiss your ticket.</li></ul>"
abandon,"<ul><li>To abandon something is to give it up completely. If you’re in a cabin and a forest fire approaches, you’d better get in your car and abandon your cabin, or else be prepared to abandon your life.</li><li>If you abandon something, you let it go, so when you describe someone as ""acting with abandon,"" it means they have let go of restrictions or inhibitions. Maybe you like to dance with abandon in the privacy of your own room. But abandon could also mean people have abandoned their senses. To ""drive with abandon,"" for example, means to drive recklessly.</li></ul>"
abandoned,"<ul><li>There's nothing spookier than an abandoned house that's still full of dusty, decaying furniture. When something is abandoned, it's been cast off or deserted.</li><li>The adjective abandoned describes something that's been given up or discarded. You can use it to talk about a kitten abandoned at an animal shelter, an old car abandoned by the side of the road, or a person's dreams of becoming an opera singer abandoned when they had kids. It comes from the French phrase mettre a bandon, ""put someone under another's control.""</li></ul>"
aberrant,"<ul><li>Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior.</li><li>For conduct that departs from the norm, aberrant is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root aberrare means ""to go astray,"" from the prefix ab- ""off, away"" plus errare ""to wander.""  Other descendants of errare in English, like error and errant, have that double -r- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected.</li></ul>"
abort,"<ul><li>To abort something is to end it. When something is aborted, it's finished.</li><li>In a movie, you may have seen people on some kind of mission yelling ""Abort! Abort!"" That means ""Stop!"" When you abort a plan or activity, you're ending it, usually prematurely. If you abort a dinner, you cancel it in the middle. If the police abort a raid, they stop it after it has already begun. A writer could abort a novel after writing a chapter or two. You can't abort something that hasn't been started: that's more like canceling or postponing.</li></ul>"
abrupt,"<ul><li>An abrupt decision is one you make suddenly. An abrupt halt is one the Road Runner comes to when reaching an abrupt drop-off — you'd hear brakes squealing.</li><li>Because being abrupt with someone is often a way of showing them that you are angry, you often apologize for the appearance of it. ""I'm sorry I was abrupt. I was rushing to get to class."" The root of abrupt is Latin rumpere ""to break,"" which also gives us rupture ""break"" and interrupt ""break into.""</li></ul>"
abruptly,"<ul><li>If the weather changes abruptly, from bright and sunny to pouring down rain, you're going to get wet. When something happens abruptly, it is sudden and unexpected.</li><li>Almost anything can change abruptly, and it will always take you by surprise, whether it's the movement of a car, the mood of a movie, or the behavior of your dog. If you've ever had a conversation with someone who spoke to you abruptly, you may have found them a little rude. A physical attribute can also be described as abrupt, like when the edge of a rocky cliff drops abruptly to the ocean.</li></ul>"
absorb,"<ul><li>To absorb is to take in or suck up like a sponge. If you don't hear your mother calling because you are reading, you could say you were absorbed in the book.</li><li>If your parents buy groceries for a party you are throwing and don't make you pay, you could say that they decided to absorb the cost of the food. Young minds absorb information easily. The word, absorbent, describes something that is capable of absorbing something else. When you go swimming on a chilly day, it's best to carry an absorbent towel so that all of the water is absorbed from the surface of your skin.</li></ul>"
abstract,"<ul><li>Use the adjective abstract for something that is not a material object or is general and not based on specific examples.</li><li>Abstract is from a Latin word meaning ""pulled away, detached,"" and the basic idea is of something detached from physical, or concrete, reality. It is frequently used of ideas, meaning that they don't have a clear applicability to real life, and of art, meaning that it doesn't pictorially represent reality. It is also used as a noun, especially in the phrase ""in the abstract"" (a joke has a person laying down a new sidewalk saying ""I like little boys in the abstract, but not in the concrete""), and as a verb (accented on the second syllable), meaning ""to remove.""</li></ul>"
absurd,"<ul><li>Something absurd is really silly, absolutely ridiculous, or total nonsense. Thinking you can wear flip flops and a bikini to the North Pole is an absurd idea, for example.</li><li>If you run into someone dressed in an absurd outfit or watch a movie full of absurd jokes, you'll probably have a good laugh. But find yourself dealing with the absurd; you'll likely be stuck in a depressing existential crisis. The absurd describes a state of being where human life has no purpose and everything is completely irrational.</li></ul>"
abundance,"<ul><li>To have an abundance of something is to have more than you need. It's often used to describe positive qualities, such as ""an abundance of love.""</li><li>Abundance is the opposite of scarcity. An abundance of wealth is a ton of cash. An abundance of friends sounds like a good thing, but it can get overwhelming when it comes to scheduling time to hang out or buying gifts. This noun comes to us from the mid-14th century French, via the Latin abundantia, meaning ""fullness, plenty.""</li></ul>"
abundant,"<ul><li>On Halloween, you can find candy in abundant supply. Use abundant to describe something that exists in large amounts that are more than what's needed.</li><li>Near synonyms are plentiful, emphasizing ""large amounts,"" and ample, emphasizing ""more than enough."" The adjective abundant is commonly followed by the prepositions with or in, to mean ""filled with or rich in something"": a region abundant in natural resources. Abundant comes from Middle English aboundant, from Old French abondant, from Latin abundāns, form of abundāre ""to overflow.""</li></ul>"
abundantly,
accelerate,"<ul><li>Accelerate means to speed up. A car accelerates when you step on the gas. You can accelerate the process of getting a visa if you happen to know someone who works in the consulate.</li><li>The fastest Amtrak trains are called the Acela line, a made-up word intended to suggest accelerate and therefore communicate that these trains are fast. If you are standing close to one when it zooms by, you may find yourself having an accelerated heart rate — they move pretty fast!</li></ul>"
access,"<ul><li>Most libraries provide computers you can use to access the Internet. If chemicals are being stolen from a lab, you might ask who has access to the lab. Access is approaching or making use of something, or the ability to do so</li><li>Sometimes the word is applied to a person. If you work in the same room as your boss, you might have easy access to her. A really good boss will work hard to make herself accessible to her employees.  Access is from Middle English, from Middle French acces ""arrival,"" from Latin accessus ""an approach,"" from accedere ""to approach.""</li></ul>"
accessible,"<ul><li>Accessible can mean easy to get to. If the mall is easily accessible, you might be tempted to spend a lot of money on your lunch breaks.</li><li>The ""within reach"" definition of the adjective accessible does not just refer to physical distance. A person can be accessible if they are approachable and friendly. A celebrity that is accessible probably signs a lot of autographs and grants interviews. The word can also describe something that is easily understood. You might need to read a plot summary of a long convoluted novel — to make it more accessible or easy to follow.</li></ul>"
accidental,"<ul><li>Anything accidental happens by chance or unintentionally. People don't mean to do accidental things.</li><li>An accident is something unforeseen that no one wanted to happen, like a car accident or getting hit by lightning. You can describe anything like that as accidental. Bumping into a stranger could be accidental. Forgetting to pay a bill is accidental. This word covers all the things that no one really meant or planned to happen. There are a lot of accidental events in the world, which is one reason insurance exists.</li></ul>"
acclaimed,
accommodate,"<ul><li>If you accommodate, you are making an adjustment to suit a particular purpose. If you accommodate your brother's demand for the attic room, then you give in and let him take over that space.</li><li>Accommodate entered English in the mid-16th century from the Latin word accommodat-, meaning ""made fitting."" Whether it refers to changing something to suit someone's wishes or providing someone with something he needs, accommodate typically involves making something fit. You might change your lunch plans, for example, to accommodate your best friend's schedule. Accommodate can also refer to providing housing or having enough space for something. You might need to open up the extra bedroom to accommodate your out-of-town guests.</li></ul>"
accomplished,"<ul><li>The adjective accomplished is useful for describing someone who's very good at something. You might use it to talk about yourself if you are an accomplished — or highly skilled — sword swallower.</li><li>An accomplished ice skater is someone who can do one of those fancy twirls on the ice, and an accomplished cupcake baker is someone you want to be friends with. Another way to use the word accomplished is to mean ""successfully completed or finished."" You might say, ""I accomplished my goal of climbing the highest mountain east of the Mississippi River."" Next up: Everest.</li></ul>"
account for,
account,"<ul><li>An account can be many things — such as a story, like if you give a friend an account of what happened at the party she missed. It can also be a business arrangement, like a bank account or an email account.</li><li>Account is one of those seemingly simple words that have a mass of different meanings. An account can be a narrative or story — a biography, for example, is an account of someone's life. Account can also mean an explanation of something, as in the phrase, ""How do you account for that?"" An account is also a handy arrangement whereby a store agrees to provide you goods on credit, but then you might have to account for all that debt.</li></ul>"
accumulate,"<ul><li>To accumulate means to gather, usually in large quantities. Let's hope your boyfriend is not the type to accumulate girlfriends.</li><li>The root of accumulate is cumulus which means ""mound"" or ""heap."" You might have heard of cumulus clouds, those big fluffy clouds that look like giant piles of whipped cream. Think of these heaping helpings of clouds when you think of accumulate. The money in your savings account accumulates interest, though these days you won't accumulate much wealth that way! Police accumulate evidence until they have enough to charge someone with a crime.</li></ul>"
accurate,"<ul><li>Something that is accurate is exact and true. It's important to be accurate in the kitchen with your measurements and in the courtroom with your testimony.</li><li>The adjective accurate comes from the Latin roots ad curare, meaning ""to take care,"" and that is precisely what you do when you make sure something is accurate. You take care to make sure it is perfectly correct: an accurate answer, an accurate headcount, an accurate assessment of the problem. By adding the Latin root in, meaning not, you can make the antonym inaccurate (not accurate).</li></ul>"
accurately,"<ul><li>Anything done accurately is done correctly or with very few mistakes. Many things should be performed accurately, especially brain surgery.</li><li>When you're accurate, you're precise: you get things right. To do something accurately is to do it in a precise, correct, careful manner. A baseball player with a good batting average hits the ball accurately. An accountant who never makes mistakes juggles the numbers accurately. If you got 100 on a test, you performed accurately. The opposite of this word is inaccurately, which means you did something wrong, incorrectly, or with a lot of mistakes.</li></ul>"
acknowledge,"<ul><li>To show that you know something is to acknowledge it. Waving ""hello"" to acknowledge a friend and nodding your head ""yes"" to acknowledge that you agree with what's being said are both acts showing knowledge or acceptance of someone or something.</li><li>Dictionaries acknowledge that the word acknowledge has roots in the 15th and 16th centuries and is a combination of roots meaning ""accord,"" ""recognize,"" and ""understand."" Whereas ""knowledge"" is what you know, acknowledging is showing that you know. You might acknowledge that the world is round and that the moon is not made of cheese. You also can acknowledge, or give recognition, to the people who discovered these truths.</li></ul>"
actually,"<ul><li>You might think your mom would be thrilled to open a birthday present and find a live rabbit, but actually that's the last thing she's hoping for. Actually is an adverb that means ""really.""</li><li>Actually can be used two ways: first, as an adverb meaning ""really."" You might say, ""It's hard to know which of these cookies will taste best without actually sampling them all."" The other way to use the word actually is to imply that your expectations have been proven wrong, that the opposite of what you thought is true. You could say, ""The hotel room looked spotless, but actually it turned out to have bedbugs.""</li></ul>"
added,
adept,"<ul><li>Are you looking for another word to describe a person who is highly skilled, very proficient or expert at something? Try the adjective adept!</li><li>In the days of Medieval Latin, an adeptus was a person who had learned the secrets of alchemy. Although an adept person today cannot turn lead into gold, the adjective is still high praise meaning ""skilled, expert, highly proficient.""</li></ul>"
adequately,"<ul><li>Something has been done adequately when basic requirements are fulfilled. Passing your driver's test probably means you parallel parked adequately; if not, you may have knocked over some cones.</li><li>The adverb adequately is a synonym for sufficiently, or suitably. If you've adequately fulfilled your course requirements, you're probably neither the best nor the worst student in the class. But you've definitely done well enough that you can pass — so doing something adequately is generally a positive thing, unless you're an overachiever, in which case you might not like that description at all!</li></ul>"
adherent,"<ul><li>Because an adherent is usually something or someone that sticks to something or someone else, it's logical that it can also mean a person who believes in and supports a certain philosophy or leader.</li><li>An adherent to a cause can be called a disciple, one who believes and tries to get others to believe. It can also refer to a material that sticks to other things.  While the first meaning comes from the 15th century, the reference to a sticky substance didn't emerge until the 16th. In all cases, the word comes from the Latin root haerēre ""stick,"" connected to the prefix ad- ""to,"" making the word mean ""to stick to.""</li></ul>"
adjacency,
adjacent,"<ul><li>Adjacent means close to or near something. You may consider the people up and down your street to be neighbors, but your next-door neighbor is the person who lives in the house or apartment adjacent to yours.</li><li>Adjacent can refer to two things that touch each other or have the same wall or border. And the adjective is often followed by the preposition to: Her office is adjacent to mine. This word is from Latin adjacere ""to lie near,"" from the prefix ad- ""to"" plus jacere ""to lie, throw.""</li></ul>"
adjust,"<ul><li>When you adjust to something, you change so that you can fit in, conform, or keep on going. Arriving at a new school almost always requires that you adjust a little. Once you adjust, you'll find you're as happy as you were in your old school.</li><li>To adjust doesn't mean to transform in a major way. It implies small but important changes that make a big difference. If you adjust your speed by just ten miles per hour, you'll get more than fifty more miles per fill-up. You can adjust your hair to make it fancier, you can adjust your lifestyle to make it more sober, or you can adjust your attitude to make yourself less annoying. You used to have to adjust your TV antenna to get a better picture. Ask your mom.</li></ul>"
administer,"<ul><li>When you administer something, you give it to others. This can apply to a dose of medicine, an order, a survey, or a punishment. Administer can also mean to run something — such as a school or an office.</li><li>The word administer belongs to a family of words, all having to do with being in charge: administration, administrator, and administrative. Strangely, administer comes from the Latin word minister meaning ""servant."" So, if your boss or principal administers an instruction that you disagree with, just think of that person as your servant. Doing so will help you carry out your duties with a smile.</li></ul>"
admire,"<ul><li>If you hold someone in high esteem or look up to someone, you admire that person. If you ask four-year-olds who they most admire, they are likely to list their mom, dad, and grandparents — or superheroes and comic book characters.</li><li>The verb admire also means to look at with wonder and pleasure. She stood on the balcony of her hotel for a long time, simply to admire the view of the ocean and the surf as it crashed against the rocks below. I admire the way she volunteers to help at the school and with other charities because she is willing to give her time to good causes.</li></ul>"
admit,"<ul><li>When you admit something, you confess that it happened.  It wasn't easy to admit that you'd broken the vase, but how else could you explain that your hand was glued to it?</li><li>Besides meaning ""confess,"" admit can also mean ""let in,"" like a theater ticket that says ""ADMIT ONE.""  If you admit that you have a bag of popcorn hidden in your backpack, you might not be admitted to the movie. A doorway admits you into a room, and if a room can hold up to 50 people, that room admits 50. You can even use admit for metaphorical entrances, like the way your wild style admits you into high fashion circles.</li></ul>"
adopt,"<ul><li>You can adopt an air of nonchalance, a fake British accent, or even a stray dog. When you adopt something, you consciously select it and accept it as your own.</li><li>The word adopt has many different shades of meaning, but most relate to the notion of taking something on and treating it as if it’s your own. You’re probably familiar with what happens if you adopt a child: you take on parental responsibilities and accept the child as if it’s your own. You can adopt other things — such as a plan, a method, or a point of view — in a similar way. For example, when you adopt a particular attitude — such as a respectful attitude — you select that as a way to present yourself and behave as if it is natural.</li></ul>"
advance,"<ul><li>The experience of having a wild monkey advance on you is pretty scary. The verb advance means ""move forward purposefully.""</li><li>When you move forward, you advance. You can advance a chess piece on a board, advance toward someone across a room, or observe an army as it advances into a country. Advance also means ""make progress,"" as when you advance your knowledge of Spanish by traveling to Ecuador, or ""to loan money,"" which a bank does by making an advance of a thousand dollars. Since the 1700s, to make advances has also meant to make romantic overtures or to flirt.</li></ul>"
advent,"<ul><li>The advent of something means that it's finally here. You might be waiting for the advent of a new iPhone or for the advent of cloning. Don't hold your breath.</li><li>Generally, the noun advent is used for the introduction of something important. The twentieth century saw the advent of many important inventions — including television, computers, and microwave dinners. If the word is capitalized, it has a religious meaning, referring to the period, observed in certain Christian religions, that begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas (December 25).</li></ul>"
affair,"<ul><li>If your grandfather was so startled by people shouting ""Surprise!"" at his birthday party that he had a mild heart attack, you'd probably want to just forget the whole affair. An affair is a specific event.</li><li>You can use affair as a kind of shorthand, to mean ""that big mess,"" or ""that complicated story I already told you about."" Your affair can also mean your responsibility or job, like if your grandmother said, ""I don't care about balloons for the party — that's your affair."" Another way affair is frequently used is to mean a love affair, particularly if the relationship is brief and intense. This meaning comes from the French phrase affaire de coeur, ""affair of the heart.""</li></ul>"
afford,"<ul><li>To afford means you have enough money or time for something. If you only have ten dollars on you, you can't afford to buy a twenty-dollar hat.</li><li>Afford is a verb that has to do with means. You either have a surplus and therefore can afford something, or else you have a deficit and can’t. It can be in the monetary sense: ""$100 for cashmere socks? I can’t afford that!” It can also refer to time: “Since my train wasn't scheduled to leave for another hour, I could afford to wait for my sister ten more minutes.” Or even access: “The castle walls afforded a wonderful view of the moat.”</li></ul>"
aggravate,"<ul><li>People who chew with their mouths open often aggravate the people near them, meaning that they exasperate their neighbors.</li><li>One trick for remembering the meaning of aggravate is to recall that it rhymes with one of its synonyms, irritate. When you irritate, you aggravate. Younger brothers often aggravate their older brothers, because they find it entertaining to get a reaction out of them. Aggravate is also used to mean ""make worse."" For example, if you have an old knee injury, it's probably best not to climb Mount Everest, because you might aggravate the injury. If your house is in foreclosure, calling your banker an ugly name is likely only to aggravate the situation. Try a little sweet talk instead!</li></ul>"
aggregate,"<ul><li>To aggregate is to collect many units into one. If you're writing a novel, you might create a character who is an aggregate of five or six real people.</li><li>Aggregate comes from the Latin verb aggregare, which means to add to. As a verb it means to collect into a mass or whole. You can also use it as an adjective, as in your aggregate sales for February, March and April. It can also be a noun. The mountain of foam in bubble bath is an aggregate of small bubbles. If you plan to work in economics or business, expect to see the word aggregate quite a lot.</li></ul>"
aggregation,"<ul><li>An aggregation is a collection, or the gathering of things together. Your baseball card collection might represent the aggregation of lots of different types of cards.</li><li>Aggregation comes from the Latin ad, meaning to, and gregare, meaning herd. So the word was first used to literally mean to herd or to flock. Now it's just refers to anything herded together in a collection or assemblage. If you work in a lab, for example, you may be charged with the aggregation of samples prior to experimentation.</li></ul>"
agile,"<ul><li>On water skis she was agile and made sharp turns and long arcs cutting through the water, but she was a lot less agile on the snowboard, landing on her face and hands as she clunked down the slopes.</li><li>People and things can be agile, or quick and graceful. Car commercials talk of ""agile handling,"" and nature-shows feature spry creatures who survive by being agile among more slow-footed and clumsy animals. Human and virtual minds also earn the description agile when they're sharp and grasp ideas or reason with speed and easy logic. Things that are agile often are thought to be light, but even heavy machines like trains and large people like sumo wrestlers can be agile.</li></ul>"
air,"<ul><li>When you breathe in, you're inhaling all that invisible stuff around us called air — a mixture of gases that includes oxygen.</li><li>To air something out can mean to expose it to the air in order to freshen it up, like leaving stinky sneakers out on the porch for a while to help them smell better. But to air a grievance or a secret is a whole other story — that means to publicize something that wasn't public knowledge before. Perhaps you have a cousin who takes great delight in airing all the family's secrets.</li></ul>"
alarm,"<ul><li>On a clock, the alarm can be set to go off at a certain time to wake nearby sleepers. You should always check the alarm on the clock at a hotel because a previous guest may have it set to go off in the middle of the night.</li><li>The noun alarm refers to a signal that is meant to rouse, alert, or awaken someone. On April 18, 1775, William Dawes, Paul Revere, and several others rode from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts to raise the alarm that the British were coming. As a verb, alarm means to be filled with anxiety or apprehension. You may become alarmed if your children become too quiet. Never a good sign — they are probably up to something mischievous.</li></ul>"
albeit,
alleged,"<ul><li>A claim or statement that is alleged hasn't been proven true — if you're an alleged murderer, you've been accused but not convicted.</li><li>When a fact is alleged, there is doubt about its accuracy. The word alleged is often used in connection with court cases, because the accused is innocent until proven guilty: an alleged robber is a suspected robber but has not been proven guilty of robbery.  Journalists often use alleged in news stories when someone’s guilt is suspected but not confirmed. Sometimes alleged means doubtful or dubious, as in ""Who is this alleged expert?""</li></ul>"
allocation,"<ul><li>If it is your job to decide how much money goes to three charities, you are in charge of the allocation of your donation. The money each charity gets is their allocation.</li><li>You'll often hear this word used when talking about things like government funding. People often debate the allocation of federal funds. Should tax dollars be used for the military, or for domestic needs like education and healthcare? These decisions are made by Congress and the President, who work together to create a budget to allocate funds appropriately.</li></ul>"
allow,"<ul><li>If you allow your best friend to read your diary, it means you've given him permission to do it.</li><li>The verb allow means to let someone do something. You can allow casually, like when you allow your friend to bite off a few pieces from your candy necklace, or more officially, as when a city government decides to allow dogs to be brought into restaurants. Allow can also be used to mean ""admit the truth of,"" so you could say, ""Fine, I'll allow that dogs aren't any dirtier than many people, but it's still strange seeing them in restaurants.""</li></ul>"
allude,"<ul><li>When you allude to something, you don't identify it or mention it specifically. If you allude to the fact that a cop is sitting right behind you, your friends might stop talking about their plans to rob a bank.</li><li>Allude is from Latin allūdere ""to play with, joke"" from the prefix ad- ""toward"" plus lūdere ""to play."" The corresponding noun is allusion, which is often used of an indirect reference in literature: Helen, a fitting name for a woman of great beauty, is an allusion to Helen of Troy.</li></ul>"
ally with,
alter,"<ul><li>After eating too many gingerbread cookies, she no longer fit into her uniform, so she had a seamstress alter it. It looked pretty much the same.</li><li>The verb alter can also mean to neuter or spay. Think of a cat that has just been spayed: the cat you pick up from the vet is the same cat that you dropped off there, only perhaps a little groggy and unable to reproduce. While the cat has been altered, it's not a different cat.</li></ul>"
amazing,"<ul><li>Use the adjective amazing to describe something that is so good, it surprises you, like the amazing beauty of the Rocky Mountains or the amazing feats of a truly great athlete.</li><li>Amazing, like incredible, awesome, and fabulous, is used so often to describe things that are just really good, you sometimes forget that its real meaning is reserved for things that are especially remarkable. The base word in amazing is amaze, which means ""to astound or perplex."" So amazing should be reserved for things that do just that.</li></ul>"
ambiguous,"<ul><li>Look to the adjective ambiguous when you need to describe something that's open to more than one interpretation, like the headline ""Squad helps dog bite victim.""</li><li>Newspaper headlines can be unintentionally funny when they're ambiguous. In ""Squad helps dog bite victim,"" is the squad helping a victim of a dog bite or helping a dog bite a victim?  The ambi- prefix means ""both ways,"" while the guous part is from the Latin verb agere, ""to lead or drive."" Thus an ambiguous sentence or situation drives us in two different directions at once. The accent is on the second syllable, ""big,"" which you can remember since something that's ambiguous can lead to big misunderstandings.</li></ul>"
ambitious,"<ul><li>Ambitious means wanting to succeed. If you want to climb Mount Everest, start your own business, and write a great philosophical treatise all before you are 30, then wow, you are really ambitious.</li><li>Having an ambition is a good thing, like wanting to get good grades, or to become a doctor. But if we say someone is ambitious, often we mean they have too much ambition. An ambitious politician might want power so badly that he’ll abandon his ideals in order to win a race. If you hatch a business plan and someone tells you it’s too ambitious, that means you’re probably not being reasonable about how much you can get done.</li></ul>"
ambivalent,"<ul><li>If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself ambivalent about it.</li><li>Ambivalent means ""having mixed feelings about something."" A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word Ambivalenz in the early twentieth century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix ambi-, meaning ""both,"" with valentia, ""strength."" So etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things — but in practice, ambivalence often arises from caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless tofu.</li></ul>"
ample,"<ul><li>Ample describes an abundance of something. An ample supply of apple muffins at the bake sale is a good thing, as is ample legroom in your new van — but if the vet notices your dog's ample waistline, you might have to put Fido on a diet.</li><li>Like amplify (crank up the volume), ample is from the Latin word amplus, meaning ""large or spacious."" Ample can be enough or even too much of something. It's great when there's ample parking or ample snacks for a hike, and we'd all be happy if we had ample time and money. But there are things that some people don't want more of — if your principal has ample evidence that you started the food fight in the cafeteria, you're probably going to end up in detention.</li></ul>"
amplify,"<ul><li>The verb amplify means to crank up the volume. Speakers amplify, or raise, the volume of the noise coming through a microphone so that everyone at the rock show can hear.</li><li>Amplify comes from the Old French word amplifier meaning ""to enlarge or expand."" It refers to making a sound “expand,” but it can also crank up something like a disagreement — if you spread rumors, you might amplify an argument. It can “enlarge” an idea — if you don't realize how bad your health is, your doctor might amplify your test results by explaining them to you in simple, and possibly frightening terms.</li></ul>"
analogous,"<ul><li>Use the adjective analogous to describe something that is similar to something else and can be compared to another.</li><li>Analogous things can be compared to each other, so a near synonym is the adjective comparable. Analogous is a term used in biology to refer to body parts that have a similar function but differ in structure, such as the wings of a bird and the wings of an airplane. Analogous is from Latin analogus, from Greek analogos, meaning ""according to a proper ratio or proportion.""</li></ul>"
ancestor,"<ul><li>An ancestor came before. Your grandmother's grandmother and any relative before her is one of your ancestors.</li><li>Ante-, a common Latin prefix, means ""before."" Cedere is Latin for ""to go."" So, an ancestor is someone who has gone before us. Evolutionary biologists have advanced the theory that all life on earth descends from a common ancestor. Ancestor can also mean ""prototype"" or ""forerunner."" The abacus is a distant ancestor of today's supercomputers.</li></ul>"
anchor,"<ul><li>On a boat, an anchor is a heavy object attached to a rope. You toss it overboard, it sinks to the bottom, and your vessel doesn't move. Anchor has the sense of what holds something in place.</li><li>When you anchor a bookshelf to the wall, you affix it to the wall so it won't come down. The anchor of a relay race is the last person to run. It's their job to hold the team's lead. And on televised news, the anchor is the person who is front and center delivering the current events, the one who draws viewers to the news on that particular station.</li></ul>"
ancient,"<ul><li>Ancient means very old. Sometimes there's a sense of ""older than old."" My grandmother, bless her soul, lived until she was positively ancient.</li><li>Ancient art is that made in places and times we refer to as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and Ancient Egypt, and ""an ancient"" is someone who lived either during those eras, or in a Biblical context, before the flood that brought us the story of Noah and the Ark.</li></ul>"
annihilate,"<ul><li>Killing ends when the thing you are killing (your sworn enemy, all hope, a pesky mosquito) is dead. Annihilate goes farther—when you annihilate something, you wipe all trace of it from the earth.</li><li>You kill a person, but you annihilate a tribe, a town, or even a species. It's nice to think that the human race made it all the way up until the 16th century before annihilate came to mean what it does now. Might this have something to do with the increasing use of gunpowder around this time?</li></ul>"
annually,"<ul><li>Something that happens annually occurs once a year, every year. If you vacation at the beach annually, you do it every summer.</li><li>Many people send holiday cards annually, mailing stacks of them every December, and everyone celebrates a birthday annually. If your work performance is reviewed annually, your boss might consider giving you a raise each year. The adverb annually comes from the adjective annual, which is rooted in the Late Latin annualis, based on annus, or ""year.""</li></ul>"
anomaly,"<ul><li>An anomaly is an abnormality, a blip on the screen of life that doesn’t fit with the rest of the pattern. If you are a breeder of black dogs and one puppy comes out pink, that puppy is an anomaly.</li><li>The noun anomaly comes from the Greek word anomolia, meaning ""uneven” or “irregular.” When something is unusual compared to similar things around it, it’s the anomaly. If you are an Olympian who comes from a family of bookish types who all find it strenuous to walk the dog, you are an anomaly.</li></ul>"
anonymous,"<ul><li>If you don't know who wrote a poem, the author is anonymous. If you don't know who donated a gift to a museum, it's called an anonymous gift from an anonymous donor. Anonymous means a person unknown.</li><li>Alcoholics Anonymous takes its name from the fact that it's a confidential group––people use only their first names and do not identify one another as members of the group. Another related meaning of anonymous is to describe something that does not have any special qualities. If you work in an anonymous office building, its design is pretty typical and not very interesting.</li></ul>"
antagonist,"<ul><li>An antagonist is someone who opposes someone else. In Superman comics, the antagonist is Lex Luthor, evil genius and archenemy of the superhero.</li><li>The noun antagonist shows up a lot when people are talking about books, plays, or movies to mean ""the bad guy,"" but it can also be used to talk about a real person if she acts against someone else. An antagonist is always in opposition, but she isn't always bad or mean; your opponent on the tennis court, for example, could be called your antagonist, simply because it is her priority to beat you in your tennis game.</li></ul>"
anticipate,"<ul><li>To anticipate something is to be expecting it. Your dog might be waiting by the door, anticipating his next walk or squirrel chase.</li><li>""Anticipating something"" also often implies that you are preparing to take some action because of your expectations — like when you anticipate your chess opponent's next move and plan a counterattack. The word anticipate can also mean ""to come beforehand"" — as in a certain musical trend anticipating another.</li></ul>"
antiseptic,"<ul><li>If you are out to kill some microorganisms, an antiseptic will come in handy! If you go to a hospital for a cut on your arm, the nurse will apply an antiseptic to the wound because it will kill any bacteria, while not harming your healthy skin.</li><li>Antiseptic is also an adjective that describes the state of being clean and without disease-causing bacteria: ""The antiseptic wash the nurse splashed over your arm was bright blue and smelled funny, but it kept your wound free of infection."" Antiseptic can also describe something that is clean in a different way — as in, free of any objectionable language. A comedian's jokes could be so antiseptic that even your grandmother would like them.</li></ul>"
antithesis,"<ul><li>An antithesis is the complete opposite of something. Though the counterculture was strong in America in 1968, voters elected Richard Nixon, the antithesis of a hippie.</li><li>The noun antithesis comes from a Greek root meaning ""opposition"" and ""set against."" It's often used today when describing two ideas or terms that are placed in strong contrast to each other. We might come across antithesis in school if we learn about the ""Hegelian dialectic."" There, the thesis, or main idea put forward in an argument, is countered with its opposite idea — the antithesis — and the two are finally reconciled in a third proposition, the synthesis. An antithesis wouldn't exist without a thesis because it works as a comparison.</li></ul>"
antler,"<ul><li>An antler is one of a pair of horns that belong to most members of the deer family. An antler is usually curved and has branches.</li><li>Antlers come in pairs: there are two antlers coming out of a deer’s head. Antlers are branched like a tree limb, and some are very long and large. The elk is an animal with impressive antlers. Antlers look intimidating and can be used as a weapon by the deer when head-butting. Only the males have antlers in most species.</li></ul>"
anxiety,"<ul><li>Anxiety is the vague, uneasy feeling you get when you're dreading something. Anxiety can also be a permanent state of nervousness that some people with mental illnesses experience, a milder version of panic.</li><li>When a scary or unpleasant event is looming, like getting a family portrait taken the year you have braces, you might feel some anxiety. You might also feel anxiety about passing chemistry, especially if you’ve skipped a lot of classes. Someone who suffers from a mild or severe mental illness might feel anxiety all the time. Deep breathing, playing relaxing music, and medication have all been known to help reduce anxiety.</li></ul>"
apart from,
apparatus,"<ul><li>Your apparatus is the collective equipment you use for specific purposes. For example, the apparatus used for scuba diving includes goggles, flippers, and a breathing tank, while a surgeon’s apparatus includes various scalpels and clamps. Different activities, different apparatuses.</li><li>The noun apparatus evolved from the Latin apparātus, meaning ""equipment or preparation."" It might refer to one item, (a breathing apparatus) or a group of items (sports apparatus). Here’s a spelling tip: often, when a word ends in -us, the plural ending changes to i — “alumnus/alumni,” “focus/foci.” However, apparatus is part of the group that doesn't change — words like “virus/viruses” or “census/censuses.” This means the plural is either apparatus or apparatuses, though the latter is more common.</li></ul>"
apparent,"<ul><li>Apparent means obvious, but — and this is confusing — it can also mean something that seems to be true but isn't definite. ""The train's arrival is apparent — it's in the station — but apparently my friend missed it because she is not getting off.""</li><li>It makes sense that apparent has the same ancient root as appear because it's about what is plain to see. Its subtle power of suggestion, however, is wonderfully useful. The ""heir apparent"" technically means next in line, but the ink isn't dry. The power of apparent is that it leaves the door open for a little ambiguity. Maybe the heir apparent will be the next king, or maybe he'll be overthrown in a bloodless coup by his apparently more ambitious cousin.</li></ul>"
apparently,"<ul><li>Apparently is an adverb meaning ""evidently"" or ""obviously."" After his sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, ""Well! Apparently somebody was hungry!""</li><li>While apparently can mean ""plainly"" — like, duh — it can also mean ""seemingly,"" which is almost ""evidently"" or ""obviously,"" but not quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was ""apparently the work of a hungry bear,"" not because he's totally sure, but because it definitely looks like something the bears around here would do.</li></ul>"
appeal,"<ul><li>Appeal means ""to ask, or address."" If you appeal to someone's better nature, you're asking them for mercy. If a shirt doesn't appeal to you, you could also say it doesn't ""speak"" to you, or more simply, you don't like it.</li><li>Appeal can also be used as a noun to refer to a request, as in ""his parents ignored his appeal for a later curfew,"" or to refer to something's attractiveness or desirability, as in ""we all agreed on the appeal of a tropical vacation."" In judicial contexts, appeal means ""to call upon a higher court to review a lower court's decision."" If a lawyer appeals a court's conviction of her client, she's asking a higher court to throw the decision out. This word descends from the Latin appellare, ""to address, call upon.""</li></ul>"
appealing,"<ul><li>The adjective appealing describes someone who is able to attract interest or is easy to like. For example, your easy sense of humor and way of making people feel comfortable make you appealing to friends old and new.</li><li>If you are appealing, people want to be around you. It might be that you are really nice, or a good listener, not to mention have good looks. Actors who are appealing tend to get a lot of parts because filmmakers know audiences will flock to see them, just as an appealing description of a dish on a menu will lead more people to order it. This something is appealing, it is — or will be — popular.</li></ul>"
appear,"<ul><li>If something appears, it comes into view. Rub a magic lamp and a genie will appear. If that's the case, she will grant you three wishes.</li><li>Appear comes from the Latin apparere meaning ""to appear, come in sight, make an appearance.""  Whether literally materializing or seeming to be true, the word appear is used to describe something coming into sight or presenting itself. The word can also be used to describe an actor appearing in a play. Julie Andrews appeared in the musical ""Victor Victoria.""  When someone looks happy, he appears to be happy. When a detail seems true, it appears to be true.</li></ul>"
appearance,"<ul><li>Your appearance is how you look: your clothes, hair, facial expression, skin tone, and posture all factor into your overall appearance.</li><li>Ever had to go somewhere you didn't want to go? If you stopped by just briefly, you made an appearance. But this word more often has to do with how things look. Your appearance is created by everything people can see, from your hair down to your shoes. Sometimes appearances can be deceiving: maybe you give an appearance of confidence, but you're really nervous inside. The saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" means ""don't judge by appearances.""</li></ul>"
application,"<ul><li>An application is a request for a job, assistance or admission to a school. Colleges might want you to submit your application by Dec. 1, but they won't let you know if you've been accepted until sometime in April.</li><li>An application is also a form you fill out for something. If you need a handicapped parking permit, you and your doctor must first fill out an application and then submit it in the town hall. An application is also a computer program designed to perform a task or solve a problem. If you didn't get enough sleep last night, the careful application of makeup can mask the dark circles under your eyes.</li></ul>"
appreciable,"<ul><li>Movie theater popcorn tastes much better than microwave popcorn. The difference between them is appreciable — that is, you notice it.</li><li>A good way to remember appreciable is to think of the related word appreciate. You appreciate the quality of the popcorn at the movie theater because it is significantly better than what you make at home. Of course, appreciable differences aren't always appreciated. There has been an appreciable improvement in the quality of televisions in the last 20 years, but if you've got an old TV, that isn't much comfort.</li></ul>"
approach,"<ul><li>To approach is to get near something. An airplane is cleared for a final approach just as the wheels approach the landing strip.</li><li>Approach comes from the Latin word appropriare which means ""go nearer to."" You can physically approach something, like a waiter going to a table. Or, you can approach a subject, usually one you're a little nervous about — like a new employee might approach her boss about getting a raise. Time can also approach, like winter, midnight, or even old age.</li></ul>"
approach,"<ul><li>To approach is to get near something. An airplane is cleared for a final approach just as the wheels approach the landing strip.</li><li>Approach comes from the Latin word appropriare which means ""go nearer to."" You can physically approach something, like a waiter going to a table. Or, you can approach a subject, usually one you're a little nervous about — like a new employee might approach her boss about getting a raise. Time can also approach, like winter, midnight, or even old age.</li></ul>"
approximately,"<ul><li>Approximately is close to a particular time, measurement, or number — but it's not exact. If you plan to meet a friend at approximately 2:00, it will be okay if you are a bit early or late.</li><li>Approximately has its roots in the Latin word proximus, meaning ""nearly."" So, approximately means ""about"" or ""close to."" If you tell someone there will be approximately seventy people at a dinner, it means you expect seventy people, though the actual number could be a little more or a little less than seventy.</li></ul>"
architecture,"<ul><li>Architecture is the process, or profession, of designing buildings and their environments. Architecture also refers to the product of this design and work.</li><li>The root of the word architecture is the Greek arkhitekton (""master builder""), which makes sense because the ancient Greeks were very skilled at architecture — think of all those columns and stadiums and temples. The Parthenon, which was begun in 447 BC, is one of the greatest examples of architecture from Classical Greece.</li></ul>"
archive,"<ul><li>An archive is a collection of older things — documents, books, movies, or something else — that's meant to preserve them. Archives tell us about history.</li><li>An archive involves old stuff — specifically, a collection of old stuff, often put together by a librarian. Newspaper archives collect old newspapers, usually all copies of a paper from a certain date onward. There are movie and music archives. Most museums have many types of archives within them. And it's always a good idea to keep an archive of important files on your computer. When you put something in an archive, you're archiving it.</li></ul>"
arduous,"<ul><li>Use the adjective arduous to describe an activity that takes a lot of effort. Writing all those college essays and filling out the applications is an arduous process!</li><li>Arduous was first used in English to mean ""steep"" or ""difficult to climb."" If you're an outdoorsman, hiking up a mountain is a lot of fun, but if you're a couch potato, it's an arduous trek. Today, the word can be used figuratively for something that is difficult or takes a lot of work. If you spend an arduous week studying for your final exams, you'll do well because you've worked really hard!</li></ul>"
arid,"<ul><li>Arid is so dry that nothing will grow. Death Valley in California features an arid climate, which is why it's called Death Valley and not Life Valley.</li><li>Arid can also mean terribly dull or lifeless. A textbook about the climate of Death Valley might be called arid if it's written in an uninteresting way. Just like you wouldn't want to live in an arid climate, you wouldn't want to sit through an arid performance of the film-turned-musical, ""Some Like it Hot.""</li></ul>"
arise,"<ul><li>Arise is a verb that means to get up, maybe to stand or get out of bed, like when you arise in the morning to get ready for the day.</li><li>The verb arise can apply to people when they get up but it can also apply to issues or situations that come up, like problems that arise when a leader takes away people's rights. What happens next? People might arise, meaning they rebel, protesting the leader's actions, maybe even declaring that they are no longer under his or her rule. If this happens, a new political party will likely arise, meaning ""come into existence.""</li></ul>"
arrangement,"<ul><li>When you organize things in an orderly way, the result is called an arrangement. If you admire your friend's arrangement of his living room furniture, you might go home and make a similar arrangement.</li><li>Your brother might keep an arrangement of Lego creations on his desk, and you could put an arrangement of wildflowers in a vase in the middle of your kitchen table. Another kind of arrangement is one you make when you negotiate an agreement with another person: ""We have an arrangement — she gives me a ride to school and I walk her dog in the afternoon."" The Old French root, arengier, means ""to set in a row.""</li></ul>"
array,"<ul><li>An array is a display of something — usually something varied. You might encounter an array of cereal brands in the cereal aisle of the grocery store. Your head says to choose the Crunchy Oats 'n' Bran, but your heart wants the Sugar-Coated Chocopuffs.</li><li>Although the word array comes from the Old French areyer, ""to put in order,"" an array often just comes together. It can be an intentional design of people or features — everything from software packages to fashion shows can have an ""impressive array"" of components. Or, an array can fall together in nature or by chance: ""the clouds became an array of beautiful shapes after the storm.""</li></ul>"
article,"<ul><li>A piece of non-fiction prose written for a publication is one kind of article.</li><li>But a piece of a collection of something is also an article, like an article of clothing. If you're talking grammar, definite and indefinite articles are words, such as a, an, and the, whose purpose is to indicate, specify and limit a noun.  An article of faith is something that is firmly believed. And an article of organization or incorporation is a section of a legal document that sets out rules for a company.</li></ul>"
as a rule,
assert,"<ul><li>Asserting is all about standing up for what you believe. You might assert an opinion, your innocence, or even your authority over someone else.</li><li>The verb assert can be used for both opinions and for oneself. When asked, you can politely assert your desire to go to the amusement park for your birthday. If no one listens to you, you can assert yourself and forcefully state that you really want to go to the amusement park for your birthday. If that fails, you should just take yourself to the amusement park for your birthday. And get better friends.</li></ul>"
assertion,"<ul><li>An assertion is a declaration that's made emphatically, especially as part of an argument or as if it's to be understood as a statement of fact.</li><li>To assert is to state with force. So if someone makes an assertion, they’re not just trying out an idea — they really mean it. An assertion can also be an act that seems to make a statement without words. When your dog urinates in multiple places up and down your block, he's making an assertion of his dominance (also called ""marking"") over his ""territory.""</li></ul>"
asset,"<ul><li>An asset is something you have that is positive. It can mean a piece of property, a piece of equipment, an ability, or even a quality.</li><li>""Her facility with math is an asset when it comes to figuring out the restaurant tab. She is an asset to the group."" A person's overall financial picture is determined by lining up everything they own in the asset column, and everything they own in the liability (or debit) column.</li></ul>"
assimilate,"<ul><li>If you are trying to fit in, you are trying to assimilate.</li><li>Imported from Latin, assimilate has the word similar within it and in fact, means ""to become like something else."" If someone moves to another country, he or she will need to assimilate by adapting to and taking in the language, culture and customs of the new place. You can also turn the phrase around to say that a country assimilates immigrants, which means that a place accepts immigrants and allows them to adapt easily. In scientific use, the body assimilates nutrients as a part of digestion.</li></ul>"
assistance,"<ul><li>If you see a blind man having trouble crossing the street, offer him some assistance. Lending a hand is just one way of providing assistance.</li><li>Assistance is a noun that means to help or aid. It's the noun form for the verb to assist. Homes for the elderly are sometimes called ""assisted living facilities"" because they provide assistance to older folks who might need assistance getting in and out of bed, or feeding themselves. If you're in a store and no one is helping you, call a manager and ask for assistance. However, if you like to shop, you probably won't need any assistance spending money.</li></ul>"
assorted,"<ul><li>An assorted group of things are different from each other. Assorted presents could include a gift certificate, a bike, and a stuffed animal.</li><li>This is a word for things that aren't like each other but are in the same grouping anyway. Assorted books are on many different topics. Assorted candies are a bunch of different candies; a bag of Milky Ways can't be assorted. This word is all about difference and variety. An assorted group can also be described as miscellaneous, mixed, motley, or sundry.</li></ul>"
assume,"<ul><li>Assume isn't only used to mean ""accept as truth without checking""; it also means ""take on the form of."" It might be safer if you don't assume that the vampire standing in front of you isn't merely a person assuming that form.</li><li>Assume always has the sense of taking on something. It may be the belief in the appearance of truth: Your mother probably assumes you do your homework right after school. It may be another form or identity: Superman assumes the identity of a city reporter. Or, it might be a physical space: If you get nervous while driving, your dad might assume control of the car.</li></ul>"
assumption,"<ul><li>An assumption is something that you assume to be the case, even without proof. For example, people might make the assumption that you're a nerd if you wear glasses, even though that's not true. Or very nice.</li><li>From the Latin assumptionem, meaning “a taking or receiving,” assumption was recorded circa 1300 as a noun describing “the reception of the Virgin Mary into heaven.” The word later shook its religious roots and developed into the noun we hear more often today, usually when a person takes something for granted or literally takes possession of something.</li></ul>"
astonish,"<ul><li>Things that might astonish you: the discovery of life on another planet, a death-defying performance, and the number of dinosaurs a six-year old child can name. To astonish is to amaze and astound.</li><li>Remember that astonish means more than surprised. It carries with it a feeling of being truly impressed. Astonish derives from the Latin tonare 'thunder.' When you are astonished, you're thunderstruck. If you plan to astonish someone, you might say before hand, ""Wait until you see this. It's going to knock your socks off.""</li></ul>"
astonishing,"<ul><li>Something astonishing is astounding, staggering, stupefying, amazing, or incredible. It's not something you see every day.</li><li>This is a pretty strong word. A dog shaking hands is not astonishing, but a dog calling 911 for its owner definitely is. Astonishing things are amazing; they blow your mind. When people first walked on the moon, that was astonishing. Miracles are astonishing. If you say, ""Holy cow! I can't believe what I'm seeing,"" you're probably seeing something astonishing.</li></ul>"
astounding,"<ul><li>Astounding is an adjective that describes something bewildering, like the astounding sight of a dog walking on two legs.</li><li>When something is astounding, you might find yourself unable to speak — after all, astounding comes from the Middle English word astouned, meaning ""to stun."" If you see something that's astounding, you might just stare and stare, speechless. Astounding also describes something so surprisingly impressive that it overwhelms, like the astounding news that you just won the lottery.</li></ul>"
astute,<ul><li>Someone who is astute is clever and has good judgment. The kid running around with a bucket stuck on his head? Not so astute.</li><li>Astute (from Latin) is a formal and flattering adjective for someone with a good head on their shoulders. It differs from its synonym shrewd in placing less emphasis on hardheadedness than on sensitivity: we talk about a shrewd bargainer but an astute interpretation. Other synonyms are perceptive (emphasizing insight) and discerning (emphasizing an ability to distinguish).</li></ul>
attachment,"<ul><li>Attachment is a sticky word: an email attachment fastens a file to an email, while someone who has an attachment to email loves email. Attachment brings things together.</li><li>Attachment is a word that's equal parts mechanical and emotional. Many gadgets — such as cameras and tractors — have attachments that allow them to get more done, like a tractor attachment for plowing snow. People have attachments to bands, political movements, sports teams, hobbies, and each other. It's important for babies to develop attachments to their parents — this means they're bonding with their parents. Attachment is a lot like duct tape — it fastens people and things together.</li></ul>"
attain,"<ul><li>The verb attain is all about reaching some mark of achievement.  You can attain a goal. You can even attain a destination.</li><li>If you consistently have the highest grades in your class, you'll probably attain a reputation for success. Attain derives in part from the Latin tangere, ""to touch,"" which is also at the root of retain, ""to keep,"" obtain, ""to get,"" and contain, ""to control."" One might obtain the discipline to contain one's emotions while studying, thereby attaining control and retaining more information.</li></ul>"
attainment,"<ul><li>The effort put into something and the pay-off when the work is over is called attainment. Attainment of your goal of learning to make the perfect omelet requires breaking a lot of eggs.</li><li>An attainment isn't just handed to you — you have to earn it through skill and hard work. In fact, in slang, attainment is used interchangeably with skill. You might say that the inventiveness and originality of a particular rapper is his attainment, just as his fame, fortune, and respect in the hip-hop community is also his attainment.</li></ul>"
attendant,"<ul><li>An attendant is someone present at a meeting or event. A flight attendant, for example, tends to the needs of passengers on a plane trip.</li><li>The word attendant has to do with being present. An attendant on a flight is present to help you if you need anything.  An attendant event is one that happens in the presence of another event. In other words, it can mean ""accompanying.""  An illness can have attendant symptoms that go along with it. Remember that the word ends in -ant.</li></ul>"
attest,"<ul><li>To attest is to prove or declare to be true. For example: the fact that you aced the SAT attests to the strength of your vocabulary.</li><li>Attest and testify come from the same Latin word testari, which means ""to declare."" Although both words are kind of formal, you often testify in a courtroom, but attest doesn't require a court of law to function. You can attest to anything — that the funny looking shoes toned your thighs, that what someone says is true, or that the new acne medicine really works. To remember it, think of when you pass a test, you attest that you know the material.</li></ul>"
attribute,"<ul><li>An attribute is a quality or characteristic given to a person, group, or some other thing. Your best attribute might be your willingness to help others, like when you stopped traffic so the duck family could cross the street.</li><li>Attribute comes from the Latin verb attribuere, which is made up the prefix ad, meaning ""to,"" and tribuere meaning ""give or bestow."" As a verb, to attribute is to give credit, like if you attribute the A on your test to all that hard studying. In Greek and Roman mythology an attribute will often stand in for a character such as Zeus's lightning bolt or Poseidon's trident.</li></ul>"
attribute to,
attribution,"<ul><li>""A wise man once said..."" Ever wonder who said that famous quotation? Then you're curious about its attribution. An attribution identifies a source or cause of something — in this case, the person who first said the quote.</li><li>Attribution often involves identifying the author or source of written material or a work of art. If you want to prove that painting you found in your basement is a van Gogh, you'd produce evidence to ensure proper attribution. The word can be used more generally to indicate the source of anything, whether it's a bombing, climate change, or success. For example, attribution of your success might be hard work and the support of family and friends.</li></ul>"
augment,"<ul><li>Do you need to make something bigger, better, or stronger? Then you need to augment it. To augment is to increase the amount or strength of something.</li><li>Maybe your bike isn't getting around very well on hills: the bike needs to be augmented with a better set of tires. People augment their computers and phones all the time, adding new gadgets and apps. They augment the storage space in their cars by buying roof racks. If the President decides to augment taxes, taxes are going up. When you see the word augment, think ""More!""</li></ul>"
available,"<ul><li>""Is this seat  available?"" ""Are you  available, or are you married?"" As you can tell from these two examples, available means ""not busy or not taken.""</li><li>Available can be used to describe anything that's ready to be used like a restaurant table or a theater seat. It can also be used to describe a person who is not involved in a romantic relationship: ""Available singles use online dating websites."" When you use a resource, like the school library, you can say that you ""avail yourself to the research opportunities made available to students."" No matter how you slice it, available means free for the taking.</li></ul>"
avenue,"<ul><li>An avenue is a street, especially a wide one lined with trees. An avenue is also any approach to doing something. For example, this web site might be a new avenue you have found for learning words.</li><li>The word avenue comes from the French avenir, meaning ""to come to, or arrive."" The first meaning is simply a wide street. An avenue — or boulevard — is likely to be busy, unlike a quiet side street. The abbreviation is ave., as in Park Ave. Also, an avenue is a way to accomplish something. If you need money but can't get a loan, you'll have to find another avenue.</li></ul>"
avid,"<ul><li>Avid usually means very eager or enthusiastic. If you're an avid reader, it means you read as much as you can, whenever you can.</li><li>But this adjective can also mean wanting something so much that you can be thought of as greedy. For example, a person can be avid for success or power. Avid is from French avide, from Latin avidus, from avere ""to desire, crave.""</li></ul>"
backup,"<ul><li>Backup is what someone gives when they help or support you. A brand new doctor might need some backup in the emergency room for the first few weeks.</li><li>Use the noun backup when you talk about extra assistance or help. Police officers call for backup when they're not sure they can handle a situation on their own, and store cashiers need backup when things get busy and customers start lining up. Another kind of backup is the one you do on your computer — in this case, a backup is the process of copying your data in case you lose the original files.</li></ul>"
barely,"<ul><li>Something barely there is hardly there at all. If there are barely any leaves on the trees, then winter is right around the corner.</li><li>Barely is a word meaning hardly, nearly, scarcely, or marginally. If there is barely a dusting of snow, there is hardly any snow at all. If your team barely won a game, then they came really close to losing. If you barely missed an ice cream truck, then you missed it by seconds. This is a word for near misses and close calls.</li></ul>"
barge,"<ul><li>A barge is a big, flat boat that can transport heavy goods over water. You might see a barge carrying a load of new cars down a river.</li><li>Barges are useful for moving very heavy things along canals and rivers. A typical barge can hold more than a thousand tons of cargo, so it's ideal for bulky, weighty goods. Barge is also a verb, meaning both ""move by barge"" and ""shove forward,"" as when you barge in the door of a crowded party or barge into your brother's room just to bother him. The root is believed to be the Greek baris, ""Egyptian boat.""</li></ul>"
barrier,"<ul><li>Barriers are walls, either physical or metaphorical. They can block movement — the Great Wall of China was a barrier to block invading forces from entering. A window shade is a light barrier. Failing English is a barrier to getting into Harvard.</li><li>When people are being excluded from joining a clique, you could say that the clique has erected a social barrier. When fighter jets fly faster than the speed of sound, they break through what feels like a wall in the sky called the sound barrier. The Green Monster at Fenway Park keeps Boston Red Sox fans from being able to watch games from outside the stadium — it's a barrier to sight. But when line drives hit the Green Monster, bouncing the ball back into left field, the Green Monster acts also a barrier to easy home runs.</li></ul>"
battle,"<ul><li>A battle is an open struggle, usually between two groups — like a baseball championship game or a food fight.</li><li>The word battle is often used in opposition to war, a series of battles. Perhaps you have heard someone tell you, after winning the first of many dance competitions, ""You may have won the battle, but you haven’t won the war!"" A battle doesn’t have to occur between two individuals or groups. You may endure an inner battle to cut down on junk food. If you skip those fries for lunch today, then you have won a small battle.</li></ul>"
accustomed to,
be aware of,
beforehand,
close resemblance to,
be consistent with,
be entitled to,
be inclined,
be susceptible to,
beckon,"<ul><li>To beckon is to use a physical gesture to call someone over to you. Universally recognized gestures used to beckon include crooking the finger or nodding the head to  invite someone over.</li><li>We get the word beckon from the Old English gebecnian, meaning ""to make a mute sign,"" which comes from bēacen, meaning ""a sign or beacon.""  (Remember that ""beacon"" is a noun while  beckon is a verb).  When you beckon to someone, you give them a physical sign to ""come here.""  Figuratively, an ice cream sundae might beckon you, calling you away from your diet.</li></ul>"
become extinct,
being,"<ul><li>A being is any living creature, from a person to a bug. Being also refers to the state of existing.</li><li>""To be, or not to be"" — that is the question when you're talking about being. Things that exist are in a state of being: this meaning of being is a little vague, but it has to do with the way things are alive and real. The other meaning is easier: beings are living things. Every person is a being, and so is every animal. Beings are no longer in a state of being when they're dead.</li></ul>"
beneficial,"<ul><li>If it's beneficial, then it's good for you — or for something. Studying is beneficial to your grades. Exercise is beneficial to your health.</li><li>Spend any time with Italians and you will hear the word bene over and over. It comes straight from Latin, and Italians use it as often as we use ""good;"" it can mean ""fine,"" ""okay,"" ""yummy,"" or ""kind and well behaved."" Bene gives us beneficial, but also benefit, beneficent, benevolent and more well-meaning words.</li></ul>"
blossom,"<ul><li>The flowering part of a plant or tree that will form the seeds or fruit is called a blossom and synonyms include bloom and flower. The noun can also refer to the state of such flowering. You shouldn't miss cherry blossom time in Washington, D.C.</li><li>As a verb, blossom means to produce flowers. Your favorite time of year may be spring, when all the trees blossom and the air is perfumed with their scent. The verb blossom also means to begin to flourish and develop. If you are a teenager, you might be waiting to blossom and feel confident in your personality and grow into your gangly limbs.</li></ul>"
boast,"<ul><li>When you boast you are bragging about yourself and your accomplishments (or maybe those of your family), often to the boredom and annoyance of your audience.</li><li>Used as either a noun or a verb, boast usually suggests exaggeration, vanity, or pride. Along those lines, English poet Sir Thomas Overbury, who died in 1613, once said, ""The man who has nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestry is like the potato — the best part underground."" However, the word can also be used in a positive way: a town can boast a new library, or a school can boast a high graduation rate.</li></ul>"
bombard,"<ul><li>To bombard is to attack, whether physically (with something like missiles) or metaphorically (with something like questions).</li><li>See the word bomb in bombard? That's a clue to its meaning. When a place is bombarded, an enemy could literally be dropping bombs on it. In the days of stoning, people were bombarded with rocks. A politician getting pestered with questions is also being bombarded. You could say a teacher who assigns a lot of homework is bombarding the class with assignments. Bombarding involves a series of attacks; one bomb or one question can't be described as a bombardment.</li></ul>"
boom,"<ul><li>A boom is a very loud, deep sound that echoes. The distant boom of fireworks might spook your nervous dog.</li><li>Guns, thunder, drums, deep voices — all of these are capable of a pretty loud boom. When they make the sound, you can also say that they boom: ""I saw the flash of lightning and got ready for the thunder to boom."" Another kind of boom is a prosperous period, like an oil boom or an economic boom. The long pole that holds a microphone or the sail on a boat is yet another type of boom.</li></ul>"
boon,"<ul><li>Boon means something beneficial to a specific person, entity, or cause. ""Getting called out of school on the day of the test was a boon for Sam, as he hadn't remembered to study.""</li><li>Boon derives from the Old Norse bón, a request for a favor. Think of a boon as a favor that no one has necessarily asked for, something extra. ""We'd just spent our last dollar on a cup of coffee so it was a real boon to find a ten dollar bill lying on the sidewalk."" Boon can also be an adjective for someone friendly and welcoming, as in ""a boon companion.""</li></ul>"
boost,"<ul><li>Think of the word boost as meaning ""help up."" Maybe you need a boost getting over a fence (hmm — are you sneaking in or sneaking out?), or maybe you are feeling low and need to boost your spirits — chocolate, anyone?</li><li>Sometimes words appear that really don't have any clear origins. Boost is one of those words, but it's a fun word, and it's thought that maybe it has some connection to boose, a Scots dialect word that carries the idea of a push.  A slang meaning of the word is to sneakily steal, like shoplifting.  You gave your cousin a boost into the window, not knowing he was planning on boosting some sneakers.</li></ul>"
boundary,"<ul><li>If you play a sport you are familiar with the term ""in bounds,"" which refers to the boundary, or limits of the playing field that the players must stay within. It is also the outer limits of any space.</li><li>A boundary is a border and it can be physical, such as a fence between two properties, or abstract, such as a moral boundary that society decides it is wrong to cross.  If you have no sense of boundaries, you probably annoy people sometimes by getting too close to them or talking about inappropriate topics. Gustave Flaubert once said, “Earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is limitless.” A boundary is basically what limits us.</li></ul>"
branch,"<ul><li>A branch can mean the ""arm"" of a tree, or any other kind of arm––a branch of a bank is a division of the bank.</li><li>Branch also works as a verb. If you play soccer every day after school and you want to ""branch out"" athletically, you might consider playing tennis. You might turn onto a little road that branches off a main one. A branch of a river is called a tributary.</li></ul>"
breakthrough,"<ul><li>An amazing discovery or a huge amount of progress can be called a breakthrough. The discovery of penicillin in 1928 was a breakthrough for modern medicine.</li><li>A personal breakthrough might be overcoming your fear of spiders once and for all. A bigger breakthrough, one that affects many people, is the invention of indoor plumbing. There's a sense of suddenness and drama associated with most breakthroughs. The word started out with a military meaning of literally ""breaking through a barrier"" in 1918. By the 1930s, it came to have the second meaning of ""abrupt solution.""</li></ul>"
breed,"<ul><li>To breed is to have babies, whether you’re a human or a hermit crab. A breed is also a specific type of a domesticated species, like a poodle or Great Dane.</li><li>The word breed comes from the Old English bredan which means to ""bring young to birth,"" but also ""cherish,” which is how most people feel about their offspring. Awwwww. But the fact is that breeding is reproducing. Also, a breed is a strain or stock of a species, such as a Siamese cat. There are many types of dog breeds, cow breeds, and even pig breeds. Members of a breed usually look and behave in a similar way.</li></ul>"
brew,
brilliant,"<ul><li>Brilliant describes something super bright, like intense lights at a football stadium, a super sparkly diamond, or the student who graduates from Harvard at age 13.</li><li>Brilliant comes from the Italian word brillare, to ""sparkle"" like those bright lights, diamonds, and brainiac kid. British people love to say things are ""Brilliant!"" in the same way Americans say ""Awesome!"" Brilliant describes anything sparkly, fabulous, or full of light. A bright color is brilliant, too, like the brilliant orange of a setting sun.</li></ul>"
brittle,"<ul><li>Something brittle is easily broken. Do you have brittle bones? Then no football or rugby for you.</li><li>Besides meaning easily fractured and emotionally cold, brittle is also a type of candy made of cooled sugar. To make peanut brittle, bake the ingredients on a cookie sheet then let the brittle cool into sheets which you break into pieces (and then eat — wreaking havoc with your braces). It's ok to use the adjective brittle freely to describe lots of things that will break easily — such as a heart, a theory, or a poorly equipped army.</li></ul>"
broad appeal,
broadly,"<ul><li>The adverb broadly is useful for describing something that's done in a general or approximate way. If you're broadly describing your new job, you're giving just the basic idea of it and leaving out the details.</li><li>You're likely to see the word broadly within the phrase ""broadly speaking."" People often say this to mean ""in general"" or ""on average."" The word can also be used in a more literal way to mean ""widely,"" as when you say, ""The teacher seemed a little scary until she smiled broadly and welcomed them to class.""</li></ul>"
bulk,"<ul><li>Don’t be intimidated by the bulk of the dictionary on your desk. If you look in it, you’ll see that bulk is a small word used to talk about large things.</li><li>Bulk has a variety of meanings that all involve something large, like the bulk of a ship in the harbor, or the excess bulk of your overweight cat. Bulk can also mean “majority,” as when the bulk of your diet is tater tots and guacamole. You can expect to put on a lot of bulk if you eat like that.</li></ul>"
burgeon,"<ul><li>Use the verb burgeon to describe something that is growing, expanding, and flourishing. If you have a green thumb, in the spring your flower gardens may burgeon. If you don't have a green thumb, your collection of plastic plants may burgeon.</li><li>Although burgeon means to grow and flourish, it doesn't necessarily have to apply only to plants. Your town can have burgeoning downtown development. Your tiny retirement account can burgeon into an excellent emergency fund if you invest even a small amount each month. You may have a burgeoning career as a villain if you overthrow a planet by using your mind-controlling ray gun on the populace.</li></ul>"
bustling,
by and large,
camouflage,"<ul><li>To camouflage is to disguise, and a camouflage is that which disguises — like the leaf-colored and patterned uniforms worn by soldiers who want to blend in with their natural surroundings.</li><li>Camouflage evolved from the French camoufler, which was slang for “to disguise.” Camoufler itself most likely comes from camouflet, meaning “puff of smoke” — a puff of smoke that makes it hard to see things. Camouflaged clothing certainly hides hunters from their prey, but the word can also be used in a more figurative sense, as in camouflaging criticism by veiling it as a backhanded compliment.</li></ul>"
cardinal,"<ul><li>A cardinal is a bright red songbird, and the word also refers to the bird's crimson color. In Catholicism, a cardinal is a high-ranking bishop. In math, you use cardinal numbers to count. A cardinal rule is one that is central and should not be broken.</li><li>Okay, that's a lot of definitions. How exactly are they related? In most cases, cardinal means central or essential. It's a cardinal principle that you use it to describe words of behavior like rule or sin. In the Church, cardinals form the central governing body, and in math the cardinal numbers (one, two, three) are the numbers you learn and use first.</li></ul>"
cargo,"<ul><li>Cargo refers to goods carried by a large vehicle, like a plane, ship, train, or truck. See a giant truck on the highway piled high with boxes, lumber, or new cars? It's carrying cargo.</li><li>Cargo originates from the Latin word carricare which means ""to load on a cart, or wagon."" Cargo can be loaded on a cart, but it's usually loaded on something much bigger. On a ship, cargo is stacked up in huge, colorful metal containers. These containers can be full of all types of cargo, like food, furniture, or electronics. You'll rarely need the plural, but it's formed by adding an -s or more commonly, an -es (cargoes).</li></ul>"
catastrophic,"<ul><li>Something catastrophic is very harmful or disastrous. When the stock market crashes, it’s a catastrophic event for investors.</li><li>This is a strong word for terrible, harmful, devastating things. Tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis are catastrophic weather events. A depression is catastrophic for the economy. In sports, if the star player is injured, that's catastrophic for the team. If a parent dies, that's catastrophic for a family. Scientists worry that climate change will have a catastrophic effect on the planet. Catastrophic events are severe and horrific. Stubbing your toe isn’t catastrophic: losing your leg in an accident is.</li></ul>"
celebrated,"<ul><li>If something is celebrated, it's famous. Your town's celebrated restaurant — the one everybody knows and talks about — might be a modest barbecue joint.</li><li>A celebrated writer is an important, well-known one, like Ernest Hemingway or Maya Angelou. In your family, a celebrated figure might be the cousin who visits every summer and tells the best stories. As long as someone is talked about and revered by a group of people, they're celebrated. This adjective comes from the verb celebrate and its Latin root celebrare, ""to sing praises of.""</li></ul>"
central,"<ul><li>Anything central is in the middle of something — or essential to it. Central things are fundamental and important.</li><li>Think about the center of a circle: it's right in the middle, equidistant from all sides. Similarly, anything central is in the middle of something. The central part of a city is downtown. You can also say something central is an important, crucial part of something. National security is a central responsibility of the President. Communication is a central goal of writing. Central things are essential and key.</li></ul>"
certain,"<ul><li>When you're certain, you're sure about something. When you raise your hand to give the answer, you feel certain that you are correct.</li><li>Certain can mean ""definite"" or ""sure to happen,"" like getting wet, a certain outcome of not having an umbrella in a rainstorm. It can also refer to a particular person or thing. You can use it avoid explaining something unnecessarily — you might say, ""There are certain things I want to do when I get home."" To avoid saying someone's name, you can say, ""a certain person,"" as in, ""A certain person left the kitchen a mess.""</li></ul>"
champion,"<ul><li>A champion is a winner, or someone who's really good at something. If you are a champion chess player, you are a superstar! When crowds sing Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" at football games, they are celebrating the fact that their team won.</li><li>Champion comes from the Latin word campionem for ""gladiator, fighter."" Rarr! No need to grab your sword, but a champion is also a person who fights for a cause. If you are the champion of fundraising, you keep pushing to raise money. As a verb, to champion means to protect or fight for something. You champion your little brother by defending him against meanies — no matter what, you are always on his side.</li></ul>"
chancy,
channel,"<ul><li>A channel is a passageway, a means of access for a thing, a communication, or an idea.</li><li>Think of a channel as sort of a tunnel or a funnel that moves something directly through. The noun channel can be used for many such avenues. It can mean a waterway such as the English Channel — the ""Chunnel"" is a tunnel beneath the Channel — or a means of accomplishing a goal, as in ""going through legal channels."" Use it as a verb when you channel your energies to achieve success.</li></ul>"
chaotic,"<ul><li>Something chaotic is really out of control or disorganized. Chaotic starts with a hard ""K"" sound (kay-AH-tick), but things that are chaotic are usually not OK, they're crazy disordered, like your crammed locker at the end of the school year.</li><li>Chaotic is an adjective that comes from the noun ""chaos,"" meaning complete and total confusion or lack of order. Your teacher might find it chaotic inside the bus on the way home from a field trip, with so much talking and singing and stored up energy bouncing around. A classic example of something chaotic is the running of the bulls in Spain, an event that lets people run the streets with a bunch of huge, sharp-horned bulls. It's totally chaotic!</li></ul>"
cherish,"<ul><li>To cherish something is to care for it deeply, to treasure it, like the way you cherish the time you spend with a favorite person you don't see often.</li><li>The verb cherish is related to words that mean “costly” and “beloved.”  When people really value something, often because they feel emotionally connected to it, they cherish it. Many of us cherish our first cars, and later in life, we cherish the memories of those days, driving around with our friends. Generally, people don't cherish things just because they cost money; they cherish experiences that matter to them.</li></ul>"
chief,"<ul><li>A chief is a leader, often of a tribe or clan. Sometimes we call the president our ""commander in chief.""</li><li>A chief is the head honcho, the big cheese, the top dog. Tribes are lead by chiefs, but so are firefighters (fire chief), policeman (police chief), and companies (Chief Executive Officer or CEO). When used as an adjective, chief describes the most important element or main ingredient of something. You couldn't make mac and cheese without the chief ingredients: macaroni and cheese.</li></ul>"
chisel,"<ul><li>When you carve a statue from a block of marble, you use a tool called a chisel to cut out the shape. Chisel is the name of the tool and also the name of the action.</li><li>A chisel has a flat, sharp end. To carve using a chisel, you hit the back of it with a hammer or another blunt instrument. Chisel can also mean ""to cheat."" If someone chisels you out of your allowance, they shaved it away from you bit by bit.</li></ul>"
choose,"<ul><li>The hardest part of adopting a dog from a shelter is when you have to choose which one to bring home with you. When you pick out one pup from the mass of barking canines, that's the dog you choose.</li><li>Any time you decide on one thing over another — whether it's a seat on a plane, a new pair of shoes, or who you want to marry — you choose it. The Old English word that choose comes from is ceosan, which means something closer to ""taste.""</li></ul>"
chronic,"<ul><li>If you smoke a cigarette once, you've simply made a bad choice. But if you're a chronic smoker, you've been smoking for a long time and will have a hard time stopping.</li><li>The word chronic is used to describe things that occur over a long period of time and, in fact, comes from the Greek word for time, khronos. If you have chronic asthma, it is a recurring health issue for you. No one likes a chronic liar! A problem that cannot be solved can also be called chronic - think of the chronic food shortages in certain parts of the world.</li></ul>"
chronically,
circuitous,"<ul><li>Circuitous means indirect or roundabout. If you're already late for school, you'll want to take the straightest, fastest way there, not a circuitous one!</li><li>Circuitous comes from the Latin word circuitus meaning ""a going around."" If you're being circuitous it's like you're going around and around in circles. It can also refer to someone's manner or speech, if they are not being direct. For example, if you want someone to get you another piece of cake, but just you sit there looking longingly at your empty plate and talking about how delicious cake is, then you're being circuitous. And annoying.</li></ul>"
circumstance,
cite,"<ul><li>To cite something means to do right by whoever said it and give them credit — for instance, if you add a brilliant statement to a paper but you’re not the one who originally wrote it, you should cite, or point to, the original author.</li><li>Using cite with the meaning ""to reference"" or ""to note"" is just one of several similar uses. A military or other official report can cite someone for an outstanding act of service, and a legal representative can cite individuals, or summon them, to show up in court. To cite a source when writing or verbally repeating something first spoken by someone else is to give a ""citation"" or ""notation"" that gives credit where credit is due.</li></ul>"
classic,"<ul><li>The noun classic means something that's very high quality, particularly if it has lasting value. The pristine Model T Ford that you keep in your garage is a classic, but the beat up old Honda you drive everyday is not.</li><li>Use the adjective classic to describe something that relates to ancient Greece or Rome. You can enjoy the classic Greek pillars on the outside of your house but still appreciate the modern plumbing on the inside of it. Classic also means excellent, of recognized authority, or definitive. Classic literature, for example, includes authors like Mark Twain and Jane Austin.</li></ul>"
clear,"<ul><li>Clear means clean and uncluttered, without distractions or confusion. If your explanation of relativity is clear, it's easy to understand. If the sky’s clear, there isn't a cloud to be seen.</li><li>As a verb, clear implies getting rid of obstacles. You can clear your head (get rid of anxiety and upsetting thoughts); clear the way (remove obstacles in your path); or clear the trees to make a clearing where you can pitch your tent. If you own your car ""free and clear,"" it's all yours — you don't owe anything on it. When you arrive in a country, you clear customs when officials check your papers and belongings and send you on your way.</li></ul>"
cling,"<ul><li>To cling is to tightly grasp something or to stick closely to something, like how wet clothes cling to the wearer.</li><li>Clinging has to do with closeness. A scared child will cling to his parent, holding on tight. People in love cling to one another in embraces. When you're on a roller coaster, it's best to cling to whatever restraint you can. Similarly, things cling to each other when they're hard to separate. Clothes fresh out of the dryer often cling to each other. Strands of cooked spaghetti cling to each other. Stretchy clothing like spandex clings to the bodies of the people who wear it.</li></ul>"
close,"<ul><li>To close is to shut something or to end something. You could close a door, close your mouth, or even close a deal.</li><li>This versatile word usually means ""the end"" or ""near."" When a store is closed, you can't go in: the door is closed and locked. When people are close, they are right next to each other — or they're emotionally close to one another. In baseball, the closer is a pitcher who tries to end the game. If your flight had ""a close call,"" it almost crashed. You can close a program on a computer, and you close your eyes when you go to sleep after reading this.</li></ul>"
clue,"<ul><li>A clue is a piece of evidence that helps solve a problem, or it's a slight hint. When you’re in the dark about the surprise party your friends are planning, they'll say, “She doesn’t have a clue!”</li><li>When you first join the police force, you’re mostly just walking the beat. But when you’re promoted to detective, your job is to look for that big clue that will help you solve the case. The original Middle English word was clew, which meant “a ball of thread.” If you were trapped in a labyrinth, you could follow the clew to help find your way out.</li></ul>"
cluster,"<ul><li>A cluster is a small group of people or things. When you and your friends huddle awkwardly around the snack table at a party, whispering and trying to muster enough nerve to hit the dance floor, you’ve formed a cluster.</li><li>Cluster comes to us from the Old English word clyster, meaning bunch. Nowadays, you can use cluster as either a noun or a verb. When we were kids, we would stand in a cluster (noun) on the street corner, eagerly awaiting the appearance of the Good Humor truck every afternoon. Then we would cluster (verb) eagerly around the driver, demanding ice cream. Virtually anything can form a cluster — flowers, cells, stars, human beings, and even events.</li></ul>"
coating,
coincide,"<ul><li>When things happen at the same time, they are said to coincide. Often, this is because they're intentionally coordinated — ""the bake sale coincided with Parent Day"" — but not always.</li><li>Coincide can also mean happen together in other ways. ""My mother's views on appropriate teen fashion do not always coincide with mine"" is a tactful way to say she hates your clothes. You could also describe two roads coming together as coinciding — though it's more poetic to talk about when they diverge.</li></ul>"
coincidence,"<ul><li>People love to talk about strange coincidences––like you and your mother having the same birthday, or two unrelated families named ""The Martins"" living next door to each other. A coincidence is something that's not planned or arranged but seems like it is.</li><li>Technically, a coincidence is an occurrence of events that happen at the same time by total accident––like you and a kid from your class at school both visit the Grand Canyon on the same day. Weird. If some guy is stalking you, always running into you wherever you go, this is not a coincidence. That guy has memorized your schedule.</li></ul>"
collaborate,"<ul><li>When you work together on shared goal, you collaborate. If you don't just split a project up evenly but work together on creating solutions, you collaborate.</li><li>Inside the word you see co-labor, or ""working together."" Cooperation is simply splitting up the work and getting it done. Collaboration is when you brainstorm, create, and share possible solutions. During World War II, however, Nazi collaborators were sharing ideas with the wrong side. In today's pop music scene, collaboration means featuring a guest star on a record, and it's often a surefire way to boost sales.</li></ul>"
collaboration,"<ul><li>When you join a group of friends to build a huge sandcastle on the beach, your impressive structure is the result of collaboration, or working together toward a common goal.</li><li>Working with another person — or a group of people — to make something together is collaboration. You can also describe the result of your work, like the elaborately decorated cake you made with your best friend, as a collaboration. During World War II, the word collaboration began being used to mean ""working traitorously with an enemy,"" and became a very serious crime.</li></ul>"
collect,"<ul><li>The verb collect describes gathering or bringing something together. Charity organizations often collect warm coats for people in need.</li><li>Other people who want to help those in need seek monetary donations. If you volunteer for a charity, you may collect on behalf of the charity — meaning you get donations. Collect can also refer to getting payment for money that is owed. If you owe money to someone, eventually he'll find you and say, ""I'm here to collect.""</li></ul>"
collide,"<ul><li>It could be protons bouncing around in a particle accelerator, two cars failing to stop at an intersection, or the priorities of two people with very different goals. When things crash together, they collide.</li><li>The verb collide has roots in the Latin word collidere, which comes from col- or  “together” and laedere, “to strike or damage,"" like planes that collide in midair. Collide can also describe ideas that clash, such as expectations that collide with reality or radical views that collide with tradition.</li></ul>"
colossal,"<ul><li>Colossal describes something so large it makes you say,  ""Whoa!"" You might have a colossal amount of homework, or see a colossal pyramid while vacationing in Egypt.</li><li>Colossal can refer to an item's physical size, like a giant redwood tree, but it can also be used to describe the force or scope of something — like the colossal force of a thunderstorm that knocked down the redwood tree, or the colossal scope of your school project on the history of the redwoods that seems like it will never, ever end. It comes from the Greek word kolossos, meaning ""gigantic statue.""</li></ul>"
commemorate,"<ul><li>To commemorate something means to remember something and by doing so to honor it, as in “We would like to commemorate his many years of past service by presenting him with this lovely gold watch.”</li><li>The word commemorate has a pretty clear echo of memory in it, so it can help to keep it in your mind just by noticing that. You might also notice that you’ve seen the word before, either in late-night infomercials or in various advertisements in magazines, when they talk about commemorative plates, or stamps, or coins: little things that are supposed to honor events or people by recalling them to our collective memory.</li></ul>"
commonly,"<ul><li>The adverb commonly is good for talking about something that usually or ordinarily happens. Mice, for example, are commonly afraid of cats.</li><li>Commonly describes an action that's to be expected. You could say that the bus commonly picks you up fifteen minutes late, or that colds and flu are commonly passed around between kids at school. The earliest use of commonly, around 1300, was to mean ""in a way common to all,"" from the adjective common, or ""belonging to all."" The Latin root communis means ""in common, public, or shared by all or many.""</li></ul>"
compact,"<ul><li>A compact is a signed written agreement that binds you to do what you've promised. It also refers to something small or closely grouped together, like the row of compact rental cars you see when you wanted a van.</li><li>As a verb, compact means ""to compress or squeeze together,""  like how the garbage truck compacts your bags of trash. Compact, the adjective, describes something that is tightly packed together, like your luggage that is so compact it fits in the overhead compartment. Compact can also describe a brief summary, like a compact explanation of how the universe began that lasted only 10 minutes!</li></ul>"
comparable,"<ul><li>Use comparable to describe two things that are alike. If you are offered two jobs with comparable salaries, you might take the one where the weather is nicer.</li><li>Comparable can also mean exactly what it looks like: things you are “able” to “compare” are comparable.  When you say that comparing two things is “like comparing apples and oranges,” you're saying the two things in question are not comparable. When you pronounce this word, remember that, unlike with “compare,” you emphasize the first syllable and swallow the first “a”: COM-pra-ble. The sounds of the two words aren't really comparable.</li></ul>"
comparative,"<ul><li>The word comparative deals, naturally, with comparisons, looking at characteristics of two or more things. For example, you might study a course such as comparative literature, which examines works from two or more cultures or languages.</li><li>Coming from the Latin verb comparāre, ""to compare,"" comparative worked its way into Late Middle English as an adjectival form indicating comparison. In the comparative form, the adjective either ends in ""-er"" (my hands are smaller than yours are) or uses the word ""more"" before it (you are more qualified than the other applicants are). The word also can offer an estimate rather than an absolute.  You might be a comparative beginner in cooking class, but your ham still won the prize.</li></ul>"
compatible,"<ul><li>A word that comes up a lot in discussions of both food and people pairings, compatible speaks to a person or thing’s ability to exist agreeably with something or someone else.</li><li>Use the word compatible to describe two things that work well together, like your Wii and your big screen TV, or peanut butter and jelly. You may have heard that opposites attract, but initial attraction doesn’t necessarily mean that opposites will be compatible in the long-term. Advised Russian novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy, “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility.”</li></ul>"
compel,"<ul><li>Compel means to force or drive someone to do something. Even if you don't like toast, when you visit the toast-eating natives of Shrintakook Island, you'll be compelled to eat it, or they will not trust you.</li><li>You don't want to be compelled to go to a classical music concert if you'd rather listen to rap. School officials might be upset if a winter storm compels them to cancel classes, but you'd be okay with that. A compelling mystery forces you to pay attention because you want to find out ""whodunit.""</li></ul>"
compelling,"<ul><li>Compelling means attractive, or irresistible, or really, really convincing. You know your argument for backpacking across Europe is compelling when your parents not only let you go but also pay for all your expenses.</li><li>To compel is to drive or force into action –– the way the fear of being grounded might compel you to come home before your curfew. A compelling argument compels you to agree with its logic –– it's irresistible. If you decide to run for class president, you'll need to write a compelling speech about why students should vote for you.</li></ul>"
compensate,"<ul><li>Compensate is about correcting for an imbalance. If you step in an unmarked pothole, the city may compensate you by paying your doctor bills treating a broken ankle.</li><li>Compensate can also mean ""to adjust for."" So, if you did stumble into the pothole and injure your left leg, then you might compensate by leaning heavily on your right leg. Increasingly, compensate is used in place of pay. Day laborers are paid for their time, but executives are more likely to be compensated with a suite that includes salary and other benefits––what is commonly referred to as a compensation package.</li></ul>"
compensate for,
complaint,"<ul><li>A complaint is an objection to something that is unfair, unacceptable, or otherwise not up to normal standards. If your neighbors have a complaint about noise, they want you to be more quiet.</li><li>A complaint is voiced objection to something, like a complaint about cold or disgusting-tasting food in a restaurant. Complaint is also a legal term — the plaintiff's reasons for bringing a civil action. Medically speaking, a complaint is a disorder or disease that is hard to cure completely. Loud cries of pain, anger, or sadness can also be called complaints.</li></ul>"
complement,"<ul><li>A complement is something that makes up a satisfying whole with something else. Those shiny red shoes you just bought complement your shiny red purse.</li><li>Complement comes from the Latin complementum, ""something that fills up or completes."" Complement keeps both the e and the meaning. It's also a verb; if you and your partner complement each other, you make a perfect pair. Something that complements completes or adds a little something.</li></ul>"
completely,"<ul><li>Use completely to describe something that is totally and utterly...something. A completely ridiculous idea is absolutely crazy and stupid.</li><li>Completely is an adverb that comes from the Latin completus, ""to fill up."" We use it to mean ""entirely"" or ""wholly."" So if a building is completely destroyed, no part of it is left standing. Reading a newspaper story or watching a documentary film completely means you finished it from beginning to end. And doing so can completely change your view on an issue.</li></ul>"
complex,"<ul><li>People who are really good at math can handle complex math problems. The rest of us are all set with simple stuff like the times tables. Use complex to refer to something that is not simple.</li><li>Something complex has two or more related parts, or is not simple in its structure. As a noun, a complex is a group of units, often a group of buildings. The adjective is stressed on the second syllable, but the noun is stressed on the first syllable. Complex is from Latin complexus, from complecti ""to encircle or embrace.""</li></ul>"
complex,"<ul><li>People who are really good at math can handle complex math problems. The rest of us are all set with simple stuff like the times tables. Use complex to refer to something that is not simple.</li><li>Something complex has two or more related parts, or is not simple in its structure. As a noun, a complex is a group of units, often a group of buildings. The adjective is stressed on the second syllable, but the noun is stressed on the first syllable. Complex is from Latin complexus, from complecti ""to encircle or embrace.""</li></ul>"
complicated,"<ul><li>When things get complicated, they are no longer simple and straightforward.  If you are asked a question that would require a long, detailed answer, you might just say, ""It's complicated.""</li><li>The word complicated came about in the 1640's to mean ""tangled"" or ""difficult to unravel."" This makes sense, considering it came from the Latin verb complicāre, meaning ""to fold together."" Consider that something with many folds is more complicated than something flat. Novelist Robert Ludlum said, ""Life is extremely complicated,"" but Confucius long ago suggested that ""Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."" Just having those two opposing viewpoints indicates how complicated life can be.</li></ul>"
component,"<ul><li>It's the Ikea curse: You spend four hours figuring out how to piece together your new furniture, only to be left with one random component, or part, that doesn't seem to fit anywhere.</li><li>It's not surprising that component is related to a Latin word that means ""to put together."" You simply can't put something together without all of the correct components. Technically speaking, a component is an element of a system or a part of a machine. But a component can also be a factor or ingredient, such as the components of a decision or the components of a really good chocolate cake.</li></ul>"
compose,"<ul><li>To compose is to put something together, like a song, poem, or even yourself. You might want to compose yourself before returning to the party after a good cry.</li><li>The word compose began with the Latin ponere, which means ""to put, place,"" referring to placing or arranging any piece of work. It's been in the music business since the 1590s, and it's generally still used to describe the act of writing songs. But you can use it whenever you're pulling something together: you might compose an essay for English class, or notice that the class is composed of all girls.</li></ul>"
composition,"<ul><li>Composition is another word for writing — the act of writing or the piece of writing that results. It also refers to what something is made of.</li><li>The word composition comes from the Latin componere, meaning ""put together"" and its meaning remains close to this. Writing classes are often called composition classes, and writing music is also called composition. This can also describe things besides writing that are ""put together.""  You could say an abstract painting has an interesting composition. Any mixture of ingredients can be called a composition. Geologists study the composition of the earth: what it's made of and how it formed.</li></ul>"
comprehensive,"<ul><li>When you want to describe something that includes all or most details, you can use the adjective comprehensive. If you get the comprehensive treatment at a spa, it might include massage, manicure and a facial.</li><li>Comprehensive is from Latin comprehensivus, from comprehensus, the source of English comprehend. In business, comprehensive insurance is insurance that covers a broad range, offering protection against most risks of a certain type. It applies mainly to car insurance.</li></ul>"
comprise,"<ul><li>When something comprises other things, it is made up of them or formed from them. The periodic table comprises 118 elements, because the whole comprises the parts.</li><li>In its traditional use, the word comprise is the opposite of compose: if A comprises X, Y, and Z, then X, Y, and Z compose A. But because compose and comprise sound so much alike, people have long confused the two. So now you often hear things like ""The band is comprised of a guitarist, a bassist, and a hairy drummer,"" whereas sticklers would prefer ""is composed of"" in that sentence. The word is undergoing a usage shift, making it just as hairy as that drummer!</li></ul>"
compulsory,"<ul><li>When something is compulsory, it is required or must be done. In most states, it's compulsory for kids to attend school (or an equivalent homeschool) from age six to seventeen.</li><li>This adjective is from Medieval Latin compulsorius, ""using force,"" from Classical Latin compellere, ""to force."" The Latin suffix –orius corresponds to English -ory, ""containing or involving."" Other English words descended from the same Latin verb are compel and compulsive.</li></ul>"
concede,"<ul><li>If you concede something, you admit that it is true, proper, or certain — usually in an unwilling way and often in the context of a competition, as in ""At midnight, the candidate finally conceded defeat.""</li><li>In its most common senses, a near synonym of concede is acknowledge — if your mom is pointing out that you need sleep before the test, you should concede the truth of what she's saying. But another meaning of concede is to give away or grant something, as when an unpopular leader is unwilling to concede power. Concede is from Latin concēdere, from the prefix com-, ""completely,"" plus cēdere, ""to go along, grant, yield."" The corresponding noun is concession.</li></ul>"
conceive,"<ul><li>To conceive is to come up with an idea. If you conceive a plan for your little brother's birthday, you dream up the perfect party, complete with a magician, rented ponies, and a cake shaped like a rocket.</li><li>Latin roots for conceive (by way of French) point to ""take into"" either ""the womb"" or ""the mind."" An idea is sometimes called ""a seed"" or ""the seed of an idea,"" and conceive means to produce something from inside the mind — or to become pregnant. Another expression is ""pregnant with ideas"" or ""pregnant with possibilities,"" and someone who can ""conceive of a thousand ways"" to solve a problem or design something is full of new ideas.</li></ul>"
consensus,"<ul><li>When there's a consensus, everyone agrees on something. If you're going to a movie with friends, you need to reach a consensus about which movie everyone wants to see.</li><li>Ever notice how people disagree about just about everything, from who's the best baseball player to how high taxes should be? Whenever there's disagreement, there's no consensus: consensus means everyone is on the same page. When you're talking about all the people in the world, it's hard to find a consensus on anything. There are just too many opinions. However, in a smaller group, reaching a consensus is possible.</li></ul>"
concern,"<ul><li>Concern is both a noun and a verb. As a noun it's something that you find particularly important. If you love pizza, getting the crust just so is a major concern during your pizza party.</li><li>Concern can also be something or someone that makes you upset or anxious, like your concern over the quality of the pizza crust. It can be a feeling of sympathy, like when your mom expresses concern over your obsession with pizza crust. As a verb, concern means to be relevant to something. Your main goal today may concern studying for your math test. Concern can also describe worry. When you stay out past curfew, your mom will be concerned.</li></ul>"
concise,"<ul><li>If something is concise, it's short and gets right to the point. A concise edition of your diary might be 50 pages of the most important entries.</li><li>Concise comes from the Latin word concidere, which means to cut down. When we use concise, we're talking about words that have been cut down. There are no concise trees, but there are concise works of political philosophy. A concise Italian-English dictionary, is shorter than an unabridged one. If you're good at quick explanations, you have a concise manner.  A good synonym is succinct.</li></ul>"
conclusive,"<ul><li>If you've got a theory that you're trying to prove, and you uncover a conclusive piece of evidence, then the case is closed. Conclusive means you've got your answer, you've proved your theory, and there can't be any doubt about it.</li><li>If want to prove that frogs can speak, and you record a frog reciting ""The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,"" that would be conclusive evidence for your claim. But if the frog seemed to be mumbling and mainly making regular old frog noises, critics would say that your video was not conclusive. You can also use the word conclusive to describe winning something easily or by a large margin, like when the talent competition judges handed the tap-dancing bear a conclusive victory, and he moved on triumphantly to the finals.</li></ul>"
conducive,"<ul><li>Conducive means tending to cause or produce something. Regular exercise is conducive to happiness and a feeling of well-being.</li><li>This adjective is usually followed by the preposition to, and it refers to bringing about something favorable or helpful: A positive attitude is conducive to good health. Conducive was formed in English from the less common verb conduce ""to lead or contribute to a result."" The verb conduce descends from Middle English conducen, from Latin conducere, from the prefix com- ""together"" plus ducere ""to lead."" And the suffix –ive means ""tending to.""</li></ul>"
configuration,"<ul><li>When you position items into any spatial arrangement, you are creating a configuration, or specific shape. For example, scientists refer to the specific, bonded arrangement of atoms to make a molecule as a configuration.</li><li>The root of configuration presents pretty much the current meaning, with the Latin configūrāre meaning ""to mold or shape."" You can see the word figure in the middle, which presents the idea of a physical form that's being shaped. As an example: the specific configuration, or arrangement, of the genes in your DNA is what makes you the unique individual that you are.</li></ul>"
confine,"<ul><li>Confine is all about setting limits. If you are confined to the house, it means you can't leave it. If you're really sick, you might be confined to your bed.</li><li>Confine can be used abstractly as well. In writing a term paper, your teacher might tell you to confine your examples to ones that you can support with direct evidence. In the 19th century, pregnancy and childbirth were often referred to as a woman's confinement—a time when she couldn't get up or out.</li></ul>"
confront,"<ul><li>Confront means either to face a situation that makes you uncomfortable, or to say something to someone about something they've done that bothers you. Rather than letting things go, when people are rude to you you should confront them.</li><li>Confront derives from the Latin con- ""with"" and -front ""front."" You can confront a sad truth, you can confront a person by calling them on their behavior, you can confront someone with the fact that they have terrible breath. You can be confronted, too—on the trip through the mountains, we were confronted by the impassibility of the road.</li></ul>"
congeal,"<ul><li>Congeal means to jell — to solidify or become gelatinous. Sounds gross? But wiggly Jell-O is actually congealed liquid, so it can't be that bad, right?</li><li>This word comes to us from the Old French word congeler, which means ""to freeze."" So when something congeals it goes from liquid to solid form, almost like freezing. No one usually likes congealed anything — whether it's chunkified old soup in the fridge or dried blood on a wound. See? Pretty gross. Jell-O is about as good as congealed gets!</li></ul>"
congregate,"<ul><li>Congregate is a verb that means to come together, to assemble, or to gather. At school dances, you may congregate with your friends, because you get nervous in front of kids you don't know very well.</li><li>Congregate comes from Latin root words com, meaning ""together"" and gregare, meaning ""to gather in a flock."" Congregation, or a gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does gregarious, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to socialize. If you remember the key word is flock — what ministers often call their congregations — you should have no trouble remembering congregate means to flock together.</li></ul>"
consecutive,"<ul><li>If things are consecutive, they happen one after the other with no break. If there are five consecutive snowstorms on five consecutive days,   you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.</li><li>Consecutive comes from the Latin consecutus, meaning ""following closely"" with no gap. Just like those snowstorms — one storm happened each day, back to back, for five days in a row. Consecutive numbers also follow each other, or advance in the right order. For example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are consecutive numbers. You should number the pages on a term paper to keep them consecutive so the teacher doesn't get confused.</li></ul>"
consequence,"<ul><li>Things in a sequence come one after another, as in a number sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4. A consequence comes after, or as a result of something you do, for example, ""He was given a traffic ticket as a consequence of running the red light.""</li><li>A consequence is a ""result"" or ""conclusion,"" and the Latin sequī, ""to follow,"" is part of its history. Most actions and acts of nature have a consequence that follows as a result. When people do something wrong, like rob a bank, the consequence will probably be prison time. If an organization works for good and finds a cure for cancer, on the other hand, people will get better as a consequence. When something occurs in nature, like a tornado touching down, destruction might be the consequence.</li></ul>"
consequent,"<ul><li>Something that happens as a result of something else can be described as consequent. Rapidly melting snow often causes consequent flooding, for example.</li><li>A politician might talk about raising the minimum wage and consequent improvements in workers' lives — in other words, she believes the positive changes for workers would be a direct result of higher minimum pay. One thing would follow the other. You're most likely to come across the adjective consequent in formal speech or writing. The Latin root word is consequi, ""to follow after.""</li></ul>"
consequential,"<ul><li>Things that are consequential are important — extremely important. Electing a new president and having a baby are consequential. Killing a fly? Not so much.</li><li>It might help you remember the meaning of consequential to think of consequences — the results of something. Consequential events have consequences, because they are hugely important events. A little bit of rain isn't consequential, but a hurricane is very consequential. Slipping on the sidewalk is not usually consequential, but if you slip and end up in the hospital, that is definitely consequential. It's occasionally hard to tell whether something is consequential, at least until some time has passed.</li></ul>"
consequently,"<ul><li>Consequently is a word that has to do with cause and effect. If you failed math, you'll consequently have to take it again.</li><li>Sometimes, we don't know why things happen. Other times, we can see one thing leading to another. That's when you can use the word consequently. An employer could say, ""We're losing money. Consequently, we have to fire you."" The city might say, ""It snowed three feet. Consequently, there's no school."" If you know that a consequence is the effect or result of something, then that should help you remember how to use consequently.</li></ul>"
conserve,"<ul><li>To conserve is to save or protect something, like money, or your energy on a long run. People are also encouraged to conserve energy by turning off lights and not cranking the air conditioner.</li><li>Conserve is from the Latin for ""to keep, preserve, guard"" (conservare). Con means ""together,"" so ""together"" we can ""serve"" the planet by not doing doughnuts in the wetlands on our jet skis. You can conserve the planet or a little something for yourself —  you might conserve hot water so you can wash your hair later, or try to conserve your old bedroom when you go off to college (and your mom is ready for a home office).</li></ul>"
consider,"<ul><li>Consider is a verb that simply means to think about, look at, or judge. Consider, for a moment, the perks of house sitting for your pool-owning neighbors before you immediately refuse their request.</li><li>Coming to us from the Latin word considerare, meaning “to look at closely"" or ""observe,” consider is a very common word that describes something you likely do multiple times a day: You probably consider what to wear in the morning, weigh your options for lunch, take into account the weather when deciding to grab your umbrella. Your life is full of consideration and you didn't even know it!</li></ul>"
considerable,"<ul><li>Use the adjective considerable to describe something that is large in amount. Things you probably spend a considerable amount of time on: homework and laundry. Things you'd rather spend time on: anything that isn't homework and laundry!</li><li>The adjective considerable can describe something of importance and is worthy of notice or respect. If you are an excellent singer, dancer, musician, writer, or similar profession, people may ask you to donate your considerable talents to charitable causes. If you're not an excellent singer, dancer, musician, or writer, they will still ask you to donate, but they are more likely to ask for money!</li></ul>"
considerably,"<ul><li>Anything described with the word considerably happens substantially or in a major way. A considerably better job is a much better job.</li><li>A considerable amount of rain is a significant amount of rain: not just a little rain. So if something occurs considerably, it occurs to a great degree. A considerably bad day is a very bad day. A considerably wealthy person is an extremely wealthy person. A considerably dark sky is a dreary sky indeed. If you feel considerably worse than yesterday, you feel much worse. This word intensifies things. When you see considerably, you know something is being heightened.</li></ul>"
consist of,
consistent,"<ul><li>If you get the same Donkey Kong score every time you play, you're consistent. It's consistent with video-game addiction, however, that you will continue to play in the hopes of beating that score.</li><li>Consistent is related to the word consist, which refers to what something is made of—""bread dough consists of flour, water, and salt."" Consistency describes texture—a consistent consistency would be brownies as rock-hard in the center as they are at the edge––hopefully, next time you bake you'll get inconsistent results.</li></ul>"
consistently,"<ul><li>The adverb consistently describes something that's done the same way for a long time. If your mom consistently forgets to add sugar when she's baking cookies, it means you can count on inedible cookies.</li><li>When something happens again and again, it happens consistently. In fact, the Latin root is consistentem, meaning ""standing still."" Consistently is most often used to describe something you can depend on, like consistently getting hungry right before lunch, or your dog consistently appearing by your side to cheer you up whenever you're feeling sad.</li></ul>"
conspicuous,"<ul><li>Keep your eye on the adjective conspicuous for something that stands out so much you notice it right away — like that zit in the center of your friend's forehead.</li><li>Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb, conspicere, meaning ""to look at."" Conspicuous can mean either very obvious to the eye (like something that is conspicuous from a distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If you are doing something wrong, it's wise not to be conspicuous about it!</li></ul>"
constant,"<ul><li>Think of something or someone that does not change as constant.  A classmate's constant drumming on the table with his fingers could be a constant source of annoyance.</li><li>Constant derives from Latin verb meaning ""to stand with,"" so something constant is continually standing with you and not wavering. You may be thankful for the constant companionship of your dog but not necessarily for your teacher's constant homework assignments. In math and science, a constant is a number that is fixed and known, unlike a variable which changes with the context. That idea crosses over to real life. If a friend is a constant in your life, that means they have always been with you and there for you.</li></ul>"
constantly,"<ul><li>When something happens constantly, it never stops or changes. If you sister constantly complains that she's hungry, she is always insisting that she's starving.</li><li>If your dog barks constantly when he's in the car, he doesn't stop until you reach your destination, and if you're constantly thinking about your upcoming trip to France, you can't ever get it out of your head. The adverb constantly comes from constant, or ""continual,"" which is rooted in the Latin constantem, ""standing firm, stable, steadfast, or faithful.""</li></ul>"
constellation,"<ul><li>When you spot the Big Dipper in the night sky, you're looking at part of the constellation called ""Ursa Major."" A constellation is a group of stars that forms a pattern and has been given a name based on its shape.</li><li>The visible night sky is divided into 88 constellations by astronomers. Organizing the stars into specific shapes and patterns helps when people study them, since they're broken down into manageable sections. A constellation can also be a cluster of things, like a constellation of freckles on your friend's nose. The stella in the middle of the word constellation means ""star"" in Latin, while the entire word means ""set with stars.""</li></ul>"
constitute,"<ul><li>To constitute is to make up a whole from smaller parts, or ""constituents."" ""What constitutes a family?"" means ""What makes up a family?""</li><li>Parents, kids, pets, and other family members constitute most people's idea of a family. The Constitution tells us what our country is all about and supposed to be made of — in other words, what constitutes the United States. This word can deal with the present or the future. The items listed in a recipe constitute what will be in a cake; later, the individual ingredients constitute the cake. Eleven players constitute a football team on the field. We can even say that abstract qualities are constituted. For example, some people think wearing sunglasses constitutes coolness. Since everything in the world is made up of other things, there's a lot of constituting going on.</li></ul>"
constitution,"<ul><li>A constitution is a statement of the basic principles and laws of a nation, state, or group, such as the U.S. Constitution. Another very common meaning of constitution is the physical makeup of a person.</li><li>The noun constitution is from Latin, from constitutus, ""set up, established,"" plus the suffix -ion, meaning ""act, state, or condition."" So think of a constitution as how a body (yours, the government's) is set up. If you have a strong constitution, it means you don't get sick very often.</li></ul>"
constrain,"<ul><li>To constrain is to hold back, restrain, or confine. If you've ever had to constrain a toddler in the middle of a temper tantrum, you know you have to watch out for flailing limbs.</li><li>The verb constrain comes from the Latin word constringere, which means to bind together or tie tightly. Constrain can imply both literal and figurative bindings. You can constrain someone by physically holding on to something like a person's shirt. Or, you can figuratively constrain someone by putting up obstacles. Your teenagers, for example, may feel constrained by your rules and accuse you of sucking the fun out of their social lives.</li></ul>"
constraint,"<ul><li>A constraint is a limit or restriction. Hopefully your school won't cut the sports or music programs due to budget constraints!</li><li>You might notice that constraint is similar to the verb constrict, as in boa constrictor. A constraint tightens around you like a snake and prevents you from doing what you want. Financial constraints prevent you from buying the latest electronic device. Are you tired of living under the constraint of your parents' rules? Sometimes your worries or feelings act as a constraint. You know that someone has become a close friend when you can talk to them without constraint.</li></ul>"
consume,"<ul><li>""The Freshman 15"" describes freshman-year college students who gain about fifteen pounds because they consume way too much lousy dorm food all day long.</li><li>To consume a cake is to eat it, the idea being that you ate the whole thing. To say a fire consumed a building is to say that the entire building was destroyed. Consume means to devour, to take in, to use up. The Unites States is often referred to as a consumer society because our economy is based on things being consumed. Whether it's gas, clothes, burgers, music, or anything that we use up as we purchase it, it's something that we consume. If we consume all the oil, there will be none left to burn.</li></ul>"
contain,"<ul><li>The verb contain has many shades of meaning but it often describes something that's held back or held in by something. Kids on the last day of school may find it hard to contain their glee when summer officially starts.</li><li>Picture Times Square on New Year's Eve. People can barely contain — or hold back — their excitement at being there. They clutch cups that contain — or hold — hot drinks that help them stay warm. The police set up barriers to contain — or restrain — the crowd to keep everyone under control. The next morning, the heaps of trash on the street will contain — or include — streamers, party hats, and cups.</li></ul>"
contemplate,"<ul><li>Before you accept a job offer, or a college's offer of admission, you should take time to contemplate the pros and cons of your decision. If you contemplate something, you think about it carefully.</li><li>Contemplate is from Latin contemplatus, past participle of contemplari ""to gaze attentively, observe,"" from the prefix com- ""together"" plus templum ""temple."" The original meaning of Latin contemplari was ""to mark out a space for observing auguries or omens,"" and the temple was a holy space reserved for this purpose.</li></ul>"
contemporary,"<ul><li>Things that are contemporary are either happening at the same time or happening now. Contemporary art is recent art.</li><li>In history class, if you hear that one famous person was a contemporary of another, that means they lived at the same time. Contemporaries are people and things from the same time period. Contemporary can also describe things happening now or recently. It's common to speak of contemporary music or contemporary furniture, for example. Those things are new, not old. Anything characteristic of the present day can be called contemporary.</li></ul>"
contention,"<ul><li>There is nothing ""content,"" or satisfying, about being in contention, and that's probably because the word contention means being in a competition that only one side can win.</li><li>""And in this corner, the contender"" is heard at most boxing matches to describe each of the fighters about to go into contention in the ring. Sometimes, though, a contention can be a battle of words or a struggle between two parties over a single point. The expression ""bone of contention"" describes a narrow object of disagreement that reaches the level of strife, or contention. For two hungry dogs, though, the bone of contention might be a serious matter.</li></ul>"
contentious,"<ul><li>A contentious issue is one that people are likely to argue about, and a contentious person is someone who likes to argue or fight.</li><li>Some issues are very controversial. They're also contentious, because people tend to argue about them, and the arguments will probably go on forever. Contentious issues get people angry and in a fighting mood. On the other hand, some people always seem to be in a fighting mood, no matter what the issue is. People like that are contentious too.</li></ul>"
contiguous,"<ul><li>Use the adjective contiguous when you want to describe one thing touching another thing, or next to it but not actually touching.</li><li>Things that are contiguous are near or next to but not actually touching and yet they are also defined as ""touching, sharing a border."" You can use this adjective to describe people or things related to and nearby others. It comes from the Latin word contiguus, which means pretty much the same thing, ""bordering upon."" Because the word has two meanings that are very similar but not always the same it can be a bit confusing. This is an example of what's called ""semantic ambiguity,"" when something can mean more than one thing or a word or phrase is not precise.</li></ul>"
continual,"<ul><li>The adjective continual describes something that's recurring, that happens again and again. If your pet wolf keeps up his continual howling all night, your neighbors will let you know about it.</li><li>Something continual doesn't seem to stop. Your continual nightmares about terrifying clowns occur night after night, and the continual interruptions of your adorable nephew while you're talking on the phone will probably seem less and less cute the longer they continue. The Latin root word is continuus, ""uninterrupted,"" and if you're truly talking about something going on without pause, you'll want to use the word continuous instead.</li></ul>"
continued,"<ul><li>Continued means ""ongoing."" You might ask your friends for their continued help with the movie you're shooting in your neighborhood, even as filming goes long into the night.</li><li>Use the adjective continued to describe something that has staying power, or that goes on for some time without pausing. A continued flow of water from a city fire hydrant just keeps on spurting, and your continued support for a politician means you keep on voting for her year after year. The Latin root of continued is continuare, ""join together or connect.""</li></ul>"
continuous,"<ul><li>The adjective continuous describes something that occurs over space or time without interruption. Some computer fans make a continuous noise — a constant buzz — that can drive you to distraction.</li><li>Continuous things don’t stop, not even for a coffee break. A continuous sheet of ice has no cracks, a continuous noise never pauses, and a continuous line of railroad is the kind you want if you’re on a train. Continual, on the other hand, is used to describe things that start and stop occasionally. Use continuous for anything that goes on and on.</li></ul>"
contour,"<ul><li>Contour is the outline or shape of something. A shoe that fits well along the contours or shape of your foot is a good fit.</li><li>Contour comes from the Italian contorno meaning ""to draw a line,"" which is precisely what you are doing when you trace the contour of something. A road that contours a mountain follows along its edge and a mattress that contours to your body, adjusts to your shape. You might buy the kind of shoes that are designed to contour or mold to the shape of your feet over time, in which case you'll have to break them in.</li></ul>"
contrive,"<ul><li>When you contrive, you make a plan or a plot. It may take you longer to contrive your way out of doing your homework than would to actually do it.</li><li>Even though contrive often has a false or cunning feel to it, it is not always a bad thing. Mental effort is always required though, as contrive is often used in connection with inventing schemes and plans to make something happen. Contraption, a complicated mysterious device that does something, is related to contrive. Have you ever seen a Rube Goldberg contraption? When you contrive to do something, your plan may end up being that complicated.</li></ul>"
controversy,"<ul><li>A controversy is a dispute or argument in which people express strong opposing views. When a popular TV show kills off a well-loved character, there's bound to be a lot of controversy.</li><li>Controversy means a quarrel (often public) involving strong disagreement, but the topic can be as unimportant as a new movie. There might be a controversy in the pages of fashion magazines over whether shorter hems are really in style, or about wearing white after Labor Day. Controversy is from the Latin contrōversus, ""turned in an opposite direction,"" from the prefix contrā, ""against,"" plus versus, a form of vertere, ""to turn.""</li></ul>"
conventional,"<ul><li>Conventional is an adjective for things that are normal, ordinary, and following the accepted way. Ho-hum.</li><li>This word describes what is typical and ordinary and that which follows accepted standards of behavior or taste. This is a word that's current definition is still very similar to its Latin root, conventionalis, which is ""pertaining to an agreement."" One way this word is used is with respect to conventional weapons, as in those ""not using, making, or involving nuclear weapons or energy; nonnuclear.""</li></ul>"
converge,"<ul><li>Use the verb converge to describe something that comes together at a common point: “Thousands of Elvis fans plan to converge on the small Arkansas town where unconfirmed sightings of the deceased superstar eating at a local barbeque restaurant had been widely reported.”</li><li>Two roads, a roomful of politicians, or a group of rabid fans — when things come together from different points they converge. Converge traces back to the Latin word vergere, meaning “to bend or to turn."" The prefix con- means ""with,"" a good way to remember that things that converge come together. Don't confuse it with diverge, which means the opposite: ""move away,"" because the prefix “dis-” means “apart.”</li></ul>"
convert,"<ul><li>Think of the word convert as meaning ""change,"" whether it is a person who adopts a new belief, or a changing action, such as when you convert dollars into euros.</li><li>Many times we can catch a word's meaning by looking at its origins. In this case, the Latin con means ""around,"" while vertere means ""turn."" So we can figure that convert means to ""turn around,"" an object or one's thoughts on an idea. For example, you might convert a meat eater into a vegetarian or an empty-nester might convert the kids' bedroom into an exercise room.</li></ul>"
convey,"<ul><li>When you convey something, you carry or deliver it. Little Red Riding Hood conveyed a basket of muffins to her grandmother. Your sad smile might convey more about your feelings than words ever could.</li><li>You can also convey a message or information, which means that you communicate it to someone directly or indirectly through your words or actions. In law, the word convey means to transfer or pass property to someone. This verb is from Middle English conveyen, from Old French conveier, ultimately from the Latin prefix com-, ""together,"" plus via, ""way.""</li></ul>"
convict,"<ul><li>A convict is a person who has been found guilty — convicted — of a crime and is serving a sentence in prison.</li><li>When you convict (accent on the second syllable) someone of a crime, you find them guilty. The person is then a convict (accent on the first syllable). When the person is released from jail, he's an ex-con, that is, he's not a convict any more.</li></ul>"
conviction,"<ul><li>A conviction is something certain: a judgment of guilty in court and a strong belief are both convictions.</li><li>In the legal world, when a judge or jury convicts someone of a crime — finding them guilty — this is called a conviction. Prosecutors try to get convictions, and defense attorneys try to prevent them. Also, convictions are beliefs — principles. The United States was founded on many convictions, such as the belief in free speech and separation of church and state. When you have a conviction, you're certain of something.</li></ul>"
convince,"<ul><li>""How again was it that you convinced me to do this?"" the boy said to his friend before they jumped out of the plane on their first sky dive. Convince means to talk someone into something, or win someone over.</li><li>A person convinces by making an argument—you can convince your parents to let you go to the movies by promising you'll do all your homework the next day. A thing can convince as well. The cash prize convinced me to enter the contest. The threat of failure convinced the kids to study.</li></ul>"
cope with,
copious,"<ul><li>If you have a copious amount of something, you have a lot of it. If you take copious notes, you'll do well when it comes time for review sessions — unless you can't read your own handwriting.</li><li>Copious comes from the Latin copia, meaning ""abundance."" You can use copious for something quantitative, like your copious admirers, or for something qualitative, like the copious gratitude you feel for your admirers. You will often see the word amounts following copious since the adjective is often used to modify a measurement of something — like copious amounts of wine or copious amounts of hair gel.</li></ul>"
core,"<ul><li>If you're looking for the most essential part or the very center of something, you're looking for its core. Like the inedible middle of an apple or your inner circle of core friends.</li><li>In the late 14th century, the noun core came about from the Old French coeur, meaning “core of fruit” and more literally, “heart.” So the core of something is its very heart, whether you're talking about the seed-containing center of a fruit, the central meaning of a book, or the core courses you need to take in order to graduate.</li></ul>"
correlate,"<ul><li>If you notice that crumbs appear on your little brother's shirt whenever the cookies disappear from the cookie jar, you can say that you've correlated two facts, meaning that you've established or revealed that they're linked in a way that explains both of them.</li><li>Detectives correlate pieces of evidence in order to solve crimes. For example, they might correlate a suspect’s bandaged hand with a shattered third-floor window.  Correlate can also be used as a noun. Some companies promote products by suggesting that their products increase “happiness correlates,” or factors that have been shown to have a relationship with happiness, like health and friendship.</li></ul>"
correspondence,"<ul><li>Correspondence is a body of letters or communications. If you've ever had a pen pal or an email buddy, you’ve written plenty of correspondence.</li><li>Besides referring to that stack of love letters you've bound up with ribbon, correspondence has a couple of other meanings, too. When you and your friend hold similar opinions about a particular subject, your thoughts are in correspondence, or ""agreement."" In mathematics, symmetrical objects are in correspondence — that is, they mirror each other exactly.</li></ul>"
correspondingly,
corroborate,"<ul><li>To corroborate is to back someone else’s story. If you swear to your teacher that you didn't throw the spitball, and your friends corroborate your story by promising that you were concentrating on math homework, she might actually believe you.</li><li>For example, a witness in court corroborates the testimony of others, and further experimentation  can corroborate a scientific theory. Near synonyms are substantiate and confirm. Corroborate, originally meaning ""to support or strengthen,"" was borrowed from Latin corrōborāre, formed from the prefix cor- ""completely"" plus rōborāre ""to strengthen"" (from rōbur ""strength"").</li></ul>"
costly,"<ul><li>Something that's costly is expensive. The worst kind of news you can hear from your car mechanic is that you need costly repairs.</li><li>Things that cost a lot of money are costly, but you can also use the word for events that cost you other things — like time, happiness, or advantage. A soldier's costly mistake might result in someone's death, and a costly law might end up hurting the people it's meant to help.In the 13th century, costful was used instead, and both words stem from cost, which has a Latin root, constare, ""to stand at,"" or ""to cost.""</li></ul>"
counsel,"<ul><li>When you give counsel or counsel someone, you give advice. If your neighbor is suing you because your dog keeps eating his begonias, you might seek the counsel of a dog trainer or, if that doesn't work, a lawyer.</li><li>You can get professional counsel — from a minister or psychiatrist or someone else trained in counseling — or you can get counsel from anyone you trust. You can ask your stylish friend to counsel you on your hairstyle, or you could write to Dear Abby for counsel on your lovelife. Counsel is also what you call a lawyer who represents you in court. In your begonia-eating dog case, your lawyer would be counsel for the defense.</li></ul>"
counter of,
counter,"<ul><li>A counter is a surface used for making transactions in a store or in a home kitchen for preparing food. In a store, you pay for items at the counter.</li><li>When counter is a verb, it means ""to speak up in opposition,"" like when you counter your opponent's argument in a debate. When something conflicts, you can say it ""runs counter to,"" like a fancy car that runs counter to your philosophy of living simply. You can think of this meaning as ""in the opposite direction,"" like ""counter-clockwise,"" meaning the direction that's opposite of clockwise.</li></ul>"
counterpart,"<ul><li>If you leap tall buildings in a single bound for the Des Moines branch of your corporation, then your Metropolis counterpart might be Superman. That means you and Superman do similar jobs, but in different locations.</li><li>The noun counterpart comes from the French word countre part, meaning “duplicate of a legal document.” In legal circles counterpart still means ""a duplicate document,"" but today it is more likely to describe people. Counterparts aren't duplicates, of course, but they have similar skills and responsibilities. If you play soccer, your counterpart is the player on the other team who plays the same position.</li></ul>"
countervail,"<ul><li>To countervail is to oppose something successfully.</li><li>To countervail is to counteract, counterbalance, or neutralize. This verb is best known to us in the form of its participle countervailing, which gets far more time in the limelight as an adjective than countervail gets as a verb. A favorite combo these days is countervailing duty, a duty imposed on imports to match (or retaliate for) what a foreign government is imposing. You could say a running back was countervailed if a defensive player stops him in his tracks.</li></ul>"
countless,"<ul><li>Countless means more than you could possibly count. If you have countless reasons why you love living in New York, there are so many reasons that you can't list them all.</li><li>Countless is a good adjective to use when you want to emphasize how endless, huge, or immeasurable something is. Your could say that smoke detectors save countless lives each year, or that your principal has tried countless times to ban soda at school, only to be outvoted by the student council over and over. The word dates from the 16th century, from the verb count, with its Old French root, conter, ""add up.""</li></ul>"
couple,"<ul><li>If you are hanging out with a couple of friends, you are hanging out with two friends. A couple is a pair or a twosome. As a verb, couple means ""to pair or match.""</li><li>As a noun, couple means ""a pair."" If two people are dating, you can refer to them as ""a couple."" Similarly, two people who are married can be called a ""married couple."" Two guys playing basketball can be called ""a couple of guys playing basketball."" As a verb, couple means ""to pair or combine,"" as people on a dance floor might couple or form pairs when the music starts. You can also couple two ideas by combining them.</li></ul>"
couple with,
covered,
crawl,"<ul><li>To crawl is to move slowly across the floor on your hands and knees. Before they learn to walk, most babies crawl.</li><li>You might crawl around looking for a lost earring, or watch a spider crawl across your ceiling. The slow, creeping movement itself is a crawl, too: ""Traffic was moving at a crawl."" When your dog has fleas, he crawls with them, and if something gives you a creepy, prickling sensation, it makes your skin crawl. Crawl probably comes from the Old Norse krafla, ""to claw one's way,"" which shares a root with crab.</li></ul>"
create,"<ul><li>To create simply means to make or bring into existence. Bakers create cakes, ants create problems at picnics, and you probably created a few imaginary friends when you were little.</li><li>Similar to conceive and spawn and the exact opposite of destroy, create is a word that often implies a little bit of imagination. In fact, it takes a lot of creativity to create something spectacular; that is, unless you're a robot, and then your creations occur automatically. Or Mother Nature, where creation just happens naturally: Birds create nests, the tides create waves, and snowstorms create days off from school.</li></ul>"
creative,"<ul><li>Do you like to make art? Do you like to write? Would you like to design clothes or buildings? Then you are a creative person.</li><li>Creative has to do with new things coming into being: creative is the opposite of destructive. Art class and art schools are good places to be creative. All the artists in a place are known as the ""creative community."" But being creative isn't just about art — to make anything new or come up with any kind of an idea takes creativity and is therefore creative. Whenever you're making something worthwhile, you're being creative.</li></ul>"
crest,"<ul><li>A crest is a showy tuft of feathers on the head of a bird. It's easy to identify a male cardinal by its bright red color and the tufted crest on its head.</li><li>The Latin word crista, which crest comes from, means ""tuft or comb."" An animal's crest can be feathers, fur, skin, or a comb like a rooster's. Something that resembles such a feature can also be called a crest, such as a plume on an old-fashioned helmet. The top or highest part of something is also a crest, like the crest of a hill or the crest of a wave. As a verb, crest means ""to reach the top"" like when you crest a mountain.</li></ul>"
crisis,"<ul><li>A crisis is a difficult or dangerous time in which a solution is needed — and quickly. For example, the crisis caused by a natural disaster might inspire you and your friends to make a donation.</li><li>The noun crisis comes from the Latinized form of the Greek word krisis, meaning ""turning point in a disease."" At such a moment, the person with the disease could get better or worse: it's a critical moment. Think of a celebrity whose recent antics generate headlines like ""Rock Star in Crisis"" — that person needs help that may or may not be sought. At the moment of crisis, things are unstable and maybe even dangerous.</li></ul>"
critical,"<ul><li>The adjective critical has several meanings, among them, ""vital,"" ""verging on emergency,"" ""tending to point out errors,"" and ""careful.""</li><li>If you're an emergency-room doctor with a patient in critical condition (on the highest alert), it's absolutely critical (vital or essential) that you be critical (careful and judicious) in your approach to their care, so that at the critical (decisive) moment, you can save their life. You must also be critical (that is, you must point out all the errors and flaws) of the jobs your colleagues are doing.</li></ul>"
criticize,"<ul><li>To criticize is to find what's wrong with something, like the improbabilities in a movie's plot line, or double standards in your father's rules.</li><li>The verb criticize comes from the noun, critic, and means ""to act like a critic."" A critic is someone who judges, and that doesn't have to mean negative judgment (think of a glowing movie review from a movie critic), but when we use criticize we always mean finding what's wrong, instead of what's good, with something. If your friend is just learning to bake, don't criticize his first batch of burned cookies too harshly; he'll just give up.</li></ul>"
crucial,"<ul><li>The word crucial describes something that is important or essential to success, like the crucial dress rehearsals that ensure everything will run smoothly on your play's opening night.</li><li>Usage experts insist that the word crucial should be used only to describe something that is truly critical for solving a problem or for resolving a situation, such as a crucial vote that determines a final outcome. In this case the crucial vote is decisive: it determines the outcome. But the word has gained popularity as a way to say that something is important. You might hear someone say, for example, that it is crucial to allow employees to vote on the new schedule to make them feel like they’re part of the process. In this case the sense is “important”: nothing decisive is taking place.</li></ul>"
crucially,
crude,"<ul><li>Is it gross? Unsophisticated? Totally tasteless and positively offensive? Then you can describe it as crude.</li><li>Crude is not rude when it’s used to describe unprocessed oil, which it first was associated with in 1865. From the Latin crudo, meaning ""rough, raw,"" crude today can be used to describe anything or anyone that's unrefined and rough around the edges. So don’t be too insulted by the large-nosed portrait that cartoonist made for you. It’s just a quick, crude drawing meant to be funny.</li></ul>"
crush,"<ul><li>When you crush something, you break it into tiny pieces or crumple it. If you crush the cans in your recycling bin, you'll make more room for more.</li><li>A train can crush a car that's stalled on the tracks, and a person can crush an insect between her fingers. A figurative meaning of crush is to subdue or stop, like when a military dictator's forces crush a rebel uprising. You can also use crush as a noun to mean ""an overwhelming number,"" like a crush of bodies on a packed subway car, or to describe infatuation, like your crush on your attractive neighbor, who also can be called your crush.</li></ul>"
cue,"<ul><li>A cue is the long stick used for playing pool. A cue is also a reminder or stimulus to do something.</li><li>In pool, you use the cue to hit the white ball into the red ball, aiming for a pocket. Other cues make things happen too. In acting, a lighting change or another actor's line could be a cue for you to enter the stage. During rehearsal, the actors need to learn their cues to make sure their timing is right. A cue can also be a clue or reminder of something. Anytime someone has good timing, they're on cue.</li></ul>"
culminate,"<ul><li>The verb culminate is used to describe a high point or a climactic stage in a process. For example, the goal of a Major League baseball team is to have their season culminate in a World Series victory.</li><li>The word culminate derives from the Latin word culminatus, the past participle of culminare, which means ""to top or crown."" Use culminate when you are referring to a crowning moment or a final conclusion: “I want my experiments combining strawberry jam with burnt toast to culminate in a Nobel Prize in Chemistry — or at least a lucrative contract with a major food supplier.”</li></ul>"
culmination,"<ul><li>The culmination is the end point or final stage of something you've been working toward or something that's been building up. The culmination of your high school career, for example, should be graduation day — and probably not prom night.</li><li>A culmination isn't just the conclusion. It's the climax of the story, the final crowning achievement, the end result of years of research. “Life is a culmination of the past, an awareness of the present, an indication of a future beyond knowledge, the quality that gives a touch of divinity to matter,” said Charles Lindbergh, the first solo pilot to fly nonstop across the Atlantic — a feat that was surely the culmination of his aviation career.</li></ul>"
cumbersome,"<ul><li>You have to wrestle a bit with the longish word cumbersome; it's cumbersome, or kind of long and clumsy, to tumble out in a sentence. It's hard to use it gracefully.</li><li>A ""cumber"" is something that slows you down, and though the words aren't related, ""lumber"" includes big pieces of heavy wood, which might slow down the person carrying them. Moving lumber is cumbersome, because it's a heavy and awkward job. Getting your laundry down the stairs or putting a Rottweiler in the bathtub can be cumbersome too.</li></ul>"
curb,"<ul><li>The hard thing about learning how to parallel park is trying to get the car close enough to the curb without hitting it. A curb is the edge of the sidewalk beside the road.</li><li>When you're using the word curb as a noun, it's the raised edging beside a street. When curb is a verb, it means to restrain or hold back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a badly acted play. Curb comes from the Latin word for ""curve,"" curvus, which describes the shape of a restraining strap on a horse's head — in the fifteenth century, this band was called a curb.</li></ul>"
current,"<ul><li>If it's in the past, it's not current. If it's out of date, out of style, or out of time, it's not current. If it's up-to-the-minute, right now, and in the present, it is current.</li><li>Origins of the word current all point to the meaning ""present."" Things that are current are happening now; they are part of the present time. News reporting looks at ""current affairs"" because past affairs are no longer news; they are history. Expressions like ""staying current"" or ""keeping up with current events"" show a need or desire to know what's popular, important, or relevant now. As a noun, a current can be a flow of water, electricity, or ideas.</li></ul>"
cushion,"<ul><li>Fabric filled with foam, feathers, or other padding material makes a cushion, which can be used to make something like a chair or sofa more comfortable.</li><li>The noun cushion can also refer to anything that is used to soften an impact or absorb shocks. In modern cars, for example, sometimes in a crash or accident, air bags will deploy and act as cushions for the passengers to prevent them from injuring themselves on hard surfaces like the dashboard or steering wheel. A cushion isn't necessarily a physical one, however, as you may want to keep an emergency fund as a cushion in case of unexpected expenses. As a verb, cushion means to protect from the impact of negative information so if you have bad news, you'll want to cushion the blow as much as possible.</li></ul>"
dam,"<ul><li>A barrier built to block the flow of water is called a dam. If you walk along a stream, you can see where beavers have built a dam out of mud and logs.</li><li>As a verb, dam means to obstruct or blockade as with a dam. If the kids you're babysitting dam up the bathtub drain when you're not paying attention, the water might overflow and cause a waterfall into the living room downstairs. But water isn't the only thing that can be dammed. You shouldn't dam up your emotions — go ahead and scream if you need to.</li></ul>"
dangle,"<ul><li>Dangle means to hang or swing loosely. If you dangle string above a kitten you will both be entertained.</li><li>The verb dangle probably comes from a late 16th century Danish or Swedish word meaning “loose or pendulous,” though we don’t know for sure. You may have a taste for big, showy earrings that dangle. Or, you might even dangle a possibility — ""If you were to dangle the prospect of dessert to a child, then you better follow through!""</li></ul>"
daring,"<ul><li>To be daring is to be bold, adventurous, and a little nervy. It’s a quality possessed by people who tend to take risks. If someone says, “I dare you,” and you always do, you’re a daring person.</li><li>If you're daring, you dare to do things that are risky and even dangerous. A daring mountain climber goes for the top of Mount Everest, and a daring policeman enters the scariest houses to catch a crook. In comics and movies, superheroes are daring. Even quitting your job to start your own business is daring. The seafarers who first traveled across the globe were daring. Daring people are brave, and daring adventures are pretty exciting.</li></ul>"
debate,"<ul><li>Another word for formally discuss is debate. Cheese lovers often debate the merits of gorgonzola, triple creme brie, and gouda. Of course, they need to accompany their arguments with a taste test!</li><li>A debate is a kind of respectful, well reasoned argument over opposing points of view, although tensions can run high and voices can be raised. In fact, the verb evolved from the Old French debatre, meaning “to fight.” Most formal debates, during a political campaign for example, keep the battles to a minimum. But if you find yourself in the midst of a debate between a Red Sox fan and a Yankees fan, things could get ugly!</li></ul>"
decimate,"<ul><li>If something is drastically reduced or killed, especially in number, you can say it was decimated. ""The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico decimated the wildlife along the coast.""</li><li>The verb decimate originally referred to a form of capital punishment for Roman troops. If there was a rebellion, one out of every ten men (thus the dec in decimate) was put to death. So the word's first expanded usage was to mean a ten percent reduction or a ten percent tax. Modern usage gives the word decimate its ""drastically reduced"" meaning, but the verb can also be used to mean ""to wipe out"" or ""to eliminate.""</li></ul>"
decimation,"<ul><li>Decimation is the near-total destruction of a group, like the decimation of the candy bars that your brother was selling for school. Sorry, little brother!</li><li>Decimation implies that nearly all of a population has been destroyed or killed. You might be angry about the decimation of the rainforest in a region of South America or the decimation of the coral in a reef where you'd hoped to snorkel some day. This noun comes from a Late Latin root, decimationem, which means ""removal of a tenth."" In ancient Rome, decimation was a military punishment that involved killing one out of every ten soldiers.</li></ul>"
decorating,
deficient,"<ul><li>Deficient means not enough or not adequate. Maybe you were deficient in caffeine that day. Maybe you were lacking in study time. But no doubt about it: you came up with a deficient number of correct answers on the physics test.</li><li>If your new car fund remains deficient, you don't have enough money to buy a new car. This presents a problem if your current car is deficient in some way — say, it no longer has enough engine power to drive up a hill. You may not feel you have what it takes to get a job, but the reality is you will have to choose between indulging your own deficiencies in this area or the car's.</li></ul>"
deflect,"<ul><li>The verb deflect describes blocking something or changing its course. Hockey goalies deflect the flying puck with their sticks or blockers, making it travel in a different direction, preferably to a teammate's stick.</li><li>In a cartoon, a mouse might ask an approaching cat, ""Hey, what's that up in the sky?"" When the cat looks up, the mouse runs away, successful in his attempt to deflect the cat's attention. When you deflect, you throw someone or something off course, often by using a distraction. Another way to deflect something — such as criticism — is to blame someone else. Eventually the truth, like the cat who quickly sees there's nothing unusual up in the sky, catches up with those who deflect.</li></ul>"
degree,"<ul><li>A unit of measurement, degree describes the level, intensity or seriousness of something. So that hot coffee may not have caused 3rd degree burns, but it still took a good degree of self-control not to scream when you sipped it.</li><li>You could say there are many degrees of appropriate usage for the noun degree. In education, it's what you earn from a college or university after passing all the right courses. When it comes to temperature, you can put your degrees into Celsius or Fahrenheit. And if you're stuck in geometry class, you'll be spending lots of time talking about the 360 degrees in a circle or the 90 degrees in a right angle.</li></ul>"
delicate,"<ul><li>Delicate things, like a flower, a necklace, or someone’s feelings are fragile, easily broken, and often quite beautiful.</li><li>A delicate situation. A delicate balance. A delicate child. A delicate lace design. A delicate taste. Sometimes the word implies intricate beauty and at other times fragility. Delicate can have negative overtones: A delicate situation is a tricky one. A delicate balance describes an agreement that might turn sour any moment. A delicate child may cry easily. But delicate can also refer to things that are very lovely and hard to reproduce: a delicate lace collar on a dress stands out. A delicate flavor, like pomegranate peach mint sauce, makes salad — or vanilla ice cream — much more delicious.</li></ul>"
delight,"<ul><li>When you like someone, you might say, ""She is an absolute delight."" You mean you think she's great: a delight is a source of joy, and to delight is to cause pleasure. Babies are particularly good at expressing delight in new things.</li><li>Delight is often associated with an initial impression—one says, ""She continues to delight us,"" to suggest that the first impression continues. The word delight derives from the Latin delectare ""to charm,"" which also gives us delectable, and the same lighthearted sense of pure, uncomplicated pleasure.</li></ul>"

deluxe,"<ul><li>Something that's extra fancy or of very high quality is deluxe. If you upgrade to a deluxe hotel room, it will be bigger, more luxurious, and probably have a great view.</li><li>You're most likely to find deluxe describing a spa, hotel, car, or house. When any of these things is deluxe, it goes beyond the ordinary to provide a superior, luxurious experience. A deluxe home might have thousands of square feet and an in-ground pool, and a deluxe cruise probably includes a large berth and gourmet food. Deluxe comes from the French de luxe, ""of luxury,"" from the Latin luxe, ""excess or abundance.""</li></ul>"
demand,"<ul><li>Demand means ""an urgent request,"" like your demand that teachers give no homework on the weekend, or the act of making the request — teachers who demand that the work get done, even if it's the weekend.</li><li>Demand comes from the Old French word demander, meaning ""ask, make inquiry."" A demand is a lot stronger than that, however. When you demand something, you want action now. A demand can also mean ""to require"" like cold weather that demands warm coats and boots. Demand is also an economic term, meaning ""the amount of an item that can be sold,"" like the demand for those snow boots: high in winter and nonexistent in summer.</li></ul>"
demise,"<ul><li>Resort to the noun demise when you describe the end, termination, or death of something or someone.</li><li>Demise is mostly used in medical or legal language, or when someone wants to sound either formal or euphemistic. The word entered English from French demettre which means ""to dismiss,"" from the Latin word mittere, meaning ""let go, send."" And you might think, after reading this quote from E. Phillips Oppenheim, that demise sounds somewhat old-fashioned: ""That my demise would have been a relief to you I can, of course, easily believe, but the means — they surely were not worthy of your ingenuity.""</li></ul>"
demography,"<ul><li>Do you know the population growth rate of your city? The education levels of everyone on your block? Then you're a fan of demography, the branch of sociology that studies human behavior by analyzing statistical information.</li><li>The word demography comes from two ancient Greek words, demos, meaning ""the people,"" and graphy, meaning ""writing about or recording something"" — so literally demography means ""writing about the people."" Like many branches of the sciences, demography began in the 19th century, when the general craze for cataloging information about the world really took off (think Darwin.) A common related word is demographics, referring to the raw statistical data that's used for analysis.</li></ul>"
dense,"<ul><li>When woods are dense, the trees grow close together. When fog is dense, you can't see through it. And if someone calls you dense, they think nothing can get into your thick skull.</li><li>Dense comes from the Latin densus which means thick and cloudy. In general, the word means packed tight and gives the sense that something is difficult to get through. Text can be dense in two different ways: when the words are packed closely together on the page, and when the text is filled with big words and complicated thoughts. Either way, reading dense text is just no fun.</li></ul>"
depend,"<ul><li>To depend is to have confidence in something or someone. You can depend on your most loyal friend to show up for your modern dance performance in the park (although you probably can't depend on her liking it).</li><li>Depend can also mean ""determined by or contingent on something else."" For example, if rain is in the forecast, your outdoor dance performance may be cancelled; it depends on the weather. Depend is almost always followed by the word on or upon, with upon being more formal. If you're speaking informally, you may drop the on or upon, as in ""It all depends how you feel."" Your decision to do that will, of course, depend upon your audience.</li></ul>"
dependable,"<ul><li>Dependable means ""reliable, steady, trustworthy."" If people can always count on you, that means you are dependable.</li><li>The adjective dependable can also mean consistent in performance or behavior, like a dependable car that always starts and rarely needs service or a dependable actor who always does a great job, regardless of the role. Dependable can also be used to describe something that is financially sound, like an investment that brings profit with little risk.</li></ul>"
depict,"<ul><li>When you depict something, you draw a picture of it, describe it, or show what it looks like. So grab a crayon, a paint brush, or even an Etch-A-Sketch and start depicting.</li><li>From the Latin depictus, meaning “to portray, paint, sketch, describe,” depict is a way to communicate what you see. To explain to an alien what a banana is, you can either depict it with drawings, describe it in words, or both. But be careful. Writes author Joyce Maynard, ""The painter who feels obligated to depict his subjects as uniformly beautiful or handsome and without flaws will fall short of making art.""</li></ul>"
deplete,"<ul><li>To deplete is to use up or consume a limited resource. Visiting relatives might deplete your refrigerator of food, or a pestering friend might deplete your patience.</li><li>The verb deplete is used like “to drain.” A long, exhausting day can deplete your body of energy and a summer drought can deplete a region’s water supply. If you deplete your body of hydration after a lot of exercise, be sure to replete yourself with a nice glass of water.</li></ul>"
depletion,"<ul><li>When you think about depletion, think about a resource being decreased. Depletion is usually not a good thing; we worry about the depletion of the ozone and the depletion of the soil.</li><li>Have you ever run out of gas or money? Then you know what it's like to be in a state of depletion. Your bank account is in a state of depletion if you've been taking a lot of money out of it. The world's oil reserves are moving closer to depletion as oil runs out. In any type of depletion, something is running low or running out.</li></ul>"
deposit,"<ul><li>You are making a deposit when you put money into your bank account. In that sentence, deposit is a noun, but you could express the same action using deposit as a verb. You deposit money into your bank account.</li><li>The verb deposit can be used to refer to anything that you put down or in place. If you're carrying your keys and groceries from the car, you may deposit those items on the counter. Just be careful you don't end up playing ""where are my keys"" in the morning, if the counter is not your usual place for depositing them. You can also use deposit when nature does the placing. You find a deposit of gold in the mountain rock or there is sediment deposited at the bottom of a river.</li></ul>"
derive,"<ul><li>If you want to talk about something that comes from something else, but you want to sound sophisticated and maybe financial or scientific, use derive, like so: That scent? It's derived from a solution of roses boiled with toothpicks.</li><li>The word derive derives from (see how we did that?) the Latin rivus or stream, as in water. That image of the stream may help you remember the meaning of derive; you may picture tracing tiny streams back to their main source. Derive is a verb, as you can see, but it's often in the news in the noun form derivative: something that is derived from something else, as in ""juice is a derivative of an orange.""</li></ul>"
desiccated,"<ul><li>To be desiccated is to be dried out. If you like desiccated fruit, you like dried fruit — such as raisins or dried apricots.</li><li>Something that's described with the adjective desiccated is extremely dry, or parched. During a drought, the ground becomes cracked and desiccated. Removing moisture and humidity from something is what makes it become desiccated. The Latin root, desiccatus, means ""to make very dry.""</li></ul>"
design,"<ul><li>To design is to conceive, create, sketch out, or invent something. An architect might design a new apartment building, and an inventor might design a new smart phone.</li><li>Charles Eames, famous designer of fancy modern chairs, said ""Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose."" That's a broad definition, but then again, design is a broad field. School kids design book report posters, engineers design bridges, and politicians design arguments against their opponents. If you really want to explore design, take some time to examine the expert layout of a Picasso painting.</li></ul>"
designate,"<ul><li>To designate is to give something a specific status. If you designate your house an opera-free zone, it means that you've officially declared that no opera is allowed to be played there.</li><li>To give a person or thing an official status is to designate it as something, like when you designate a meeting place if members of your group get lost at the amusement park. Sometimes, it can carry responsibility or an assignment, like when your teammates designate you as the captain. It can also show a category, like when you designate certain books to the humor section of the bookstore where you work.</li></ul>"
designation,"<ul><li>When something has a designation, it has a title or a description that helps you identify it. The “organic” designation on the vegetables you buy lets you know that no pesticides were used in growing the plants.</li><li>Designation can refer to a title, official or otherwise. You may earn the designation “class clown” for your goofiness, or ask your friends to refer to you by the designation, ""Madame Super Brain."" Designation is also the act of assigning such a title or position, like the designation of your daughter as heir to your estate. Often, designation refers to giving a formal position. The district board may be responsible for the designation of the next principal at your school.</li></ul>"
despite,"<ul><li>Despite is used as a preposition when something happens even though it might have been prevented by something else. You might go see a movie despite hearing a negative review of it.</li><li>Despite is just one letter away from despise, and they actually share a root: the Latin verb despicere, meaning ""to look down on scornfully."" Despite came to mean ""contempt"" or ""scorn"" in English, though that use as a noun has mostly dropped out of use. The phrase ""in despite of"" gradually got shortened to the preposition despite and lost its scornful quality. If you accomplish something despite the obstacles in your way, there's no need to feel spiteful about it.</li></ul>"
detect,"<ul><li>The verb detect means to discover or observe the existence of something. If you walk into your house and detect the odor of burnt food, you can deduce from the evidence that you will be going out to dinner tonight!</li><li>The verb detect comes from the Latin word detegere, which literally means ""to uncover"" — or more figuratively, to discover. You may detect the presence of a new dog in your house if you note a water bowl, chew toys, and grooming tools. Of course, the large woofing beast that greeted you at the door with a wagging tail might be a big clue as well.</li></ul>"
determine,"<ul><li>If you determine something, you figure it out or settle a question, like when, after checking paws and hands, you determine that it's not the dog that ate your candy stash, but your kid sister.</li><li>Determine comes from the Latin for ""bring to a close,"" and when you determine something, you have closed all the questions you have about it and are quite sure you know the answer. If you become a detective, you'll have to determine who did the crime. After working through a mathematical problem, you determine the value of X. Determine can also mean influence. Your childhood spent in your grandmother's delightful kitchen might have determined your future career as a baker.</li></ul>"
detractor,"<ul><li>A detractor is someone who puts you down. When you're proposing ideas at work, your detractor is the person who finds fault with everything you say.</li><li>Use the noun detractor for someone who is always critical. You might describe your brother as a detractor of the government if he complains incessantly about taxes, voting, the President, and all the members of Congress. If a person takes a dislike to you in particular, he is your own personal detractor. The origin of detractor goes back to the Latin word detrahere, ""take down, pull down, or disparage.""</li></ul>"
detrimental,"<ul><li>Detrimental is a formal way of saying ""harmful."" Anything detrimental hurts, hinders, or puts a damper on something. Detrimental things do damage.</li><li>Have you ever heard ""Smoking may be detrimental to your health"" and wondered what it meant? It means that smoking is bad for your health: it's going to harm you in a bunch of ways. Detrimental is a more official, formal way of talking about things that do harm. A dog who likes digging holes can be detrimental to a garden. If you're writing a paper and want to pick an alternative to harmful that sounds more formal, detrimental is a great choice.</li></ul>"
deviate,"<ul><li>If something turns off course or is diverted, it deviates from the expected or the norm. Deviating from explicit recipe directions is never a good idea, unless you want inedible food or a kitchen fire.</li><li>The verb deviate can refer to divergence from a predicted path or road (""the airplane's route deviated from the flight plan""), but it can also refer to a divergence from normal behavior or expectations. When women demanded the right to vote, their behavior was considered shocking and deviated from the expectations of the time.</li></ul>"
deviation,"<ul><li>Anything that varies from the accepted norm or standard is called a deviation. It is common in math and science, but it can refer to anything that differs from the expected.</li><li>Deviation in nature is an important part of evolution. When something causes a creature’s DNA to change, it creates a deviation, or a changed characteristic. If the deviation makes the organism better able to survive, it passes the change on to its descendants. People are naturally given to change, so there are deviations in critical thought as well as in math and science. Those deviations often account for the creativity that gives rise to new ideas, or theories, or even musical styles.</li></ul>"
devise,"<ul><li>To devise is to figure out a plan. Men twirling long mustaches might devise a plan to tie someone to the railroad tracks.</li><li>To devise a plan is more than just making one; there's a lot of figuring out to do, such as: ""Phoebe devised a bus route that picked up kids in alphabetical order."" There's a method to the madness of devising. The chemistry class devised a plan to make the fire alarm go off. Devise can be positive, too, meaning to find a creative solution: ""The design team devised a plan to make the trailer home look like a medieval castle.""</li></ul>"
devoid,"<ul><li>You're stranded in the ocean, miles from shore, clinging to a sinking boat, and you can't swim? Sorry to say, your situation is devoid of all hope.</li><li>When you fall off a cliff, you fall into the void. Void means ""empty."" Devoid means ""empty of."" Always answer the question ""Of what?"" when you use it: ""My wallet is devoid of cash. My teacher is devoid of pity. My cookie jar is devoid of cookies."" These examples are devoid of anything not totally depressing!</li></ul>"
devoted,"<ul><li>Being devoted to something means being focused on that particular thing almost exclusively. When you are devoted to a cause, you work to achieve its goals. When you are devoted to a person, you place their needs above your own.</li><li>Being devoted doesn't have to refer only to personal relationships. It can focus on any area, activity, or passion. Cookbooks are devoted to presenting recipes, dog breeders are usually devoted to one specific type of dog, and tabloids are devoted to gossiping about celebrities. There's nothing wrong with being devoted to an activity or a person, as long as you don't lose track of everything else in your life. That’s when being devoted crosses over into being obsessed.</li></ul>"
devoted to,
devour,"<ul><li>When you've gone all day without eating anything, you'll probably devour your dinner, especially if it's your very favorite homemade lasagna. Devour means to eat greedily and hungrily.</li><li>The meaning of devour has grown to include the consumption of things other than food. If you sit down to start a book and look up ten hours later having turned the last page, you have devoured that book. If your after school job devours all your free time, chances are your grades are going to drop. The Latin root, devorare, means ""to swallow down.""</li></ul>"
dictate,"<ul><li>When you dictate something, you are giving orders — acting a bit like a dictator.</li><li>Dictate can also be used in a broader sense. Weather often dictates how many layers of clothes you wear, and the school rules dictate how you behave in and out of class. In a very different meaning, dictate means to say something out loud to a person or into a machine so it can be recorded. Up until fairly recently, bosses dictated letters and reports to secretaries who wrote them down.</li></ul>"
differential,"<ul><li>Things that show a difference or act in different ways can be described as differential. You and your sister may get differential benefits from eating a vegetarian diet.</li><li>You're most likely to come across the adjective differential in scholarly or scientific writing — it's really just a more formal way to say ""different"" or ""differing."" Sociological studies or articles often describe differential circumstances or outcomes, like the differential effects on various children of being raised with one parent. The Latin differentia is at the root of differential — it means ""diversity or difference,"" and it comes from differre, ""to set apart.""</li></ul>"
diffuse,"<ul><li>Diffuse means to spread out. Candlelight can diffuse a soft glow throughout a room. A diffuse idea is one that spreads from person to person, and a diffuse speech is scattered and unclear.</li><li>As a verb, diffuse means to spread something out, but also applies to spreading things such as ideas or culture so that they become widely known. When something is diffused, it's mixed in, and when you drop propaganda pamphlets out of airplanes you're diffusing the propaganda. The adjective comes from Latin diffusus, from diffundere ""to pour in different directions,"" from the prefix dis- ""apart"" plus fundere, ""to pour.""</li></ul>"
dilemma,"<ul><li>A dilemma is a tough choice. When you're in a difficult situation and each option looks equally bad, you're in a dilemma.</li><li>Dilemma is from a Greek for ""double proposition."" It was originally a technical term of logic, but we use it now for any time you have a problem with no satisfactory solution. If you're at the mall choosing between red or blue socks, that's not really a dilemma. But if you have to choose whether to save your cat or your dog from a burning building, that's an awful dilemma.</li></ul>"
diligent,"<ul><li>Someone who is diligent works hard and carefully. If you want to write the epic history of your family, you'll have to be very diligent in tracking down and interviewing all of your relatives.</li><li>Diligent comes from the Latin diligere, which means ""to value highly, take delight in,"" but in English it has always meant careful and hard-working. If you're a diligent worker, you don't just bang away at your job; you earnestly try to do everything right. Although being lucky and talented doesn't hurt, it's the diligent person who eventually succeeds.</li></ul>"
diligently,"<ul><li>Doing something diligently means doing it thoroughly and well. It's the opposite of doing it lazily or shoddily.</li><li>If you are tireless, persevering, and do things with great care, then you do things diligently. This is an adverb that goes with hard and careful work. If you have a test coming up, the more diligently you review your materials, the better your grade will be. Workers who do their job diligently tend to get promoted. Some dogs diligently pursue squirrels in the park. When someone uses this word about something you've done, it's a huge compliment.</li></ul>"
dilute,"<ul><li>When you dilute something, you make it thinner, weaker, or more watered down. If you put lots of ice cubes in your soda, the ice will melt and dilute the drink.</li><li>Think about diluting as lessening the quality but increasing the quantity. Unless you're diluting a really strong drink to make it taste better or diluting heavy paint to get a lighter shade — then the quality actually improves. Quipped President John F. Kennedy, “Public speaking is the art of diluting a two-minute idea with a two-hour vocabulary.”</li></ul>"
dim,"<ul><li>Dim has several meanings related to a lack of light, hope, or knowledge. A room that is not well lit is dim, a slow thinker is dim, and when life looks hopeless, your prospects are dim.</li><li>To dim a light is to dull it, like by putting a shade over it. A vague idea without a lot of specifics is also dim, since it's hard to see or understand the idea. Someone who's not very bright is dim or a dimwit. When things are hopeless, they're dim too. For example, if a football team is losing by fifty points, their chances of winning are dim.</li></ul>"

For example, if a football team is losing by fifty points, their chances of winning are dim.</li></ul>"
dimension,"<ul><li>A dimension is the measurement of something in physical space. You might give the painters every dimension of the rooms you want painted, including depth, height, and width.</li><li>In addition to physical objects, dimension can describe something less tangible, such as the magnitude or extent of something. You might be shocked by the dimension of damage from the explosion down the street. Dimension can also be a feature of something, such as an experience, situation, flavor, or thing. Painting your bedroom purple will add a mystical dimension to your dwelling, especially if you add unicorn accents.</li></ul>"
disassemble,"<ul><li>The verb disassemble means to take something apart. It's one thing to disassemble a computer; it's a whole other thing to put it back together again.</li><li>If you take your car to the repair shop to have a squeaky brake fixed, you'll be surprised to see the mechanics quickly disassemble your car, removing even its wheels and doors. You can use the word disassemble whenever something's dismantled or broken into pieces. Originally, disassemble meant ""to disperse,"" or to stop a crowd of people from assembling, but the meaning changed to its current definition in the 1600s.</li></ul>"
disband,"<ul><li>You know how rock bands are always forming and then breaking up? When they break up, they disband. The word disband refers to any group or unit of folks who decide to go their separate ways.</li><li>Long before there were rock bands, groups of friends or warriors would band together for protection or companionship. They would become a band of sorts. The prefix dis comes from the Latin word for ""apart."" So if people come together to form a band — like Robin Hood's Merry Men — then if they disband, they decide to separate and break apart. Groups don't always disband because they want to. Sometimes police officers or government officials disband groups they believe are a nuisance or a threat.</li></ul>"
discard,"<ul><li>When you discard something, you get rid of it. If your closet is overflowing with clothes you haven't worn since 1992, why not discard some of them?</li><li>When the verb discard first entered the English language in the sixteenth century, it referred to card playing and meant “to throw a card away.” Discard is still used to describe getting rid of unlucky cards, but today, you’ll also hear it used in a broader sense — we discard, or throw away, things that are undesirable or no longer useful. You might discard a worn out shoe, for example.</li></ul>"
discernible,"<ul><li>Discernible means noticeable. If your extra hours training are having no discernible influence on your basketball game, it means your game has not changed.</li><li>You can use discernible in two senses. First, you can use it to describe something you physically see: Because the sky was so clear, the ship was discernible from miles off. You can also use it to describe something you sense or understand: When your younger brother told he was sorry he broke your baseball bat, the truth was discernible in his voice.</li></ul>"
discharge,"<ul><li>To discharge is to fire a gun or an employee, or to set someone free from a hospital or jail. You'd probably like being discharged from jail, but not from your job, unless you really hate it.</li><li>As a verb, discharge is “to release,” and as a noun, it refers to the act of or setting free. You'd be discharged from the hospital once the discharge from your wound has stopped. Ew. The writer Ambrose Bierce jokingly defined emotion as ""a prostrating disease caused by a determination of the heart to the head. It is sometimes accompanied by a copious discharge of hydrated chloride of sodium from the eyes.” Wouldn't want to cry in front of that guy!</li></ul>"
discipline,"<ul><li>When you have discipline, you have self-control. When you discipline children, you are either teaching them to be well-behaved, or you are punishing and correcting them.</li><li>The origins of this word offer great clues about its current meanings. The Old French descepline referred to punishment and suffering. The Latin disciplina meant ""teaching, learning."" The Old English version referred to a branch of knowledge or field of study (so if you're really good at word origins, you might want to make etymology your discipline). Developing discipline as a form of training is a military concept that's more than 500 years old.</li></ul>"
discrete,"<ul><li>Discrete means separate or divided. A discrete unit is a separate part of something larger. A room is a discrete space within a house, just as the crankshaft is a discrete part of a car engine.</li><li>If something is discrete, it has its own space. An ice cube comes from an ice tray, but it has its own discrete compartment. A student government might have discrete committees for different projects. Don't confuse discrete with its close cousin discreet, which means “appropriately private.” Billionaire Bruce Wayne, for example, is very discreet about his secret life as Batman. You could say Batman is a discrete, or separate, part of Bruce Wayne’s identity. Anything distinct and separated is discrete.</li></ul>"
disentangle,"<ul><li>When you disentangle something, you free it from a snarl or tangle. If you have long hair and pierced ears, you've probably had to disentangle an earring from a curl of hair.</li><li>Something that becomes tangled or twisted needs someone to disentangle it — you might disentangle your kitten from a length of yarn, or disentangle your jacket from a thorny bush when you're hiking through the woods. You can also disentangle someone figuratively, helping them get out of an uncomfortable or difficult situation. Tangle is at the heart of disentangle, from the fourteenth century word tagilen, ""to involve in a difficult situation.""</li></ul>"
disguise,"<ul><li>A disguise is something you put on so no one recognizes you. It also can be used as a verb. You can disguise yourself with a wig and mustache; that's a great disguise.</li><li>Disguise can be used anytime you're talking about concealing or hiding something. Most of the time we think of a disguise as something you wear, but you can also disguise your feelings. Criminals might disguise their intentions. You can also use the word to describe something that seems to be one thing, but turns out to be another. You missed the plane, but then the plane crashed. That's a blessing in disguise.</li></ul>"
disgust,"<ul><li>Disgust is a strong feeling of dislike. If you can't stand peas, you might wrinkle your nose in disgust when you are served a bowl of pea soup.</li><li>Disgust is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it's a reaction to something you think is gross or terrible, like showing your disgust at a movie by getting up and leaving. As a verb, disgust means ""to offend,"" like when your class's bad behavior at the assembly disgusts all the teachers, or ""to gross out or revolt."" If you pick your nose in public, you will disgust everyone around you.</li></ul>"
disintegrate,"<ul><li>Soak your tooth in a cup of soda for long enough and it will disintegrate, or break apart from decay.</li><li>The word disintegrate comes from a combination of the prefix dis- meaning ""do the opposite of"" and the Latin integrare meaning ""to make whole."" When something disintegrates, it does the opposite of become whole; it falls apart. Objects can either disintegrate over time — like a tooth soaking in a cup of soda, or instantaneously — like a building disintegrating into dust from an explosion.</li></ul>"
dismantle,"<ul><li>To take something apart or down is to dismantle it. If you dismantle a computer to see what it looks like inside, you better know how to put it back together, or you might be looking at the inside of your room for awhile.</li><li>Dismantle is a verb used for both physical things and ideas. You can dismantle a campground by taking down the tents and breaking apart the fire logs, or you can dismantle a government by going against its leadership and bringing down its rule. Often when you dismantle something, you take away its ability to work, as with a nuclear warhead, but you can also take apart decorative or non-working things, as when you dismantle a science-fair display or a city made of blocks.</li></ul>"
dismiss,"<ul><li>At the end of a lesson period, your teacher says, ""class dismissed."" This means that you and the rest of the students are free to go.</li><li>Dismiss means to let go. If a judge dismisses a case, it means he's saying it has no merit, and is throwing it out of court. If you are dismissed from your job, it means you've been fired. And if you've been ignoring your friends' warnings that your boyfriend is cheating, you've been dismissing their concerns. ""Don't dismiss me!"" is something you say when the person you're talking to is not taking you and your comments seriously.</li></ul>"
disorder,"<ul><li>Disorder is a lack of order — in other words, chaos, clutter, and general disarray.</li><li>If everyone in your class is yelling and throwing things, there's no order: there's disorder. If all the library books are out of order and thrown sloppily on the shelf, that's disorder, too. If you mess or mix something up, you're disordering it. Many medical conditions and diseases are also called disorders, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Whenever there's disorder, something is wrong or out of whack.</li></ul>"
dispensable,"<ul><li>Something that's dispensable isn't necessary — you don't really need it. Your vintage typewriter is cool, but it's also dispensable, since you can type and print with your laptop.</li><li>If robots are invented to do most of the jobs in the world, human workers will become dispensable, or unneeded. Likewise, many home chefs might insist that if you have a really good, sharp knife, other tools like peelers and choppers and food processors are completely dispensable. The earliest definition of this word was ""subject to dispensation,"" from the Latin dispensare, ""disburse or distribute,"" although by the 1640s dispensable meant ""that which can be done without.""</li></ul>"
dispersal,"<ul><li>Dispersal is the act of spreading something around. This could be positive (like a dispersal of money) or negative (like a dispersal of a crowd because of a bomb).</li><li>If you know that dispersing is when something spreads out or separates, then you have a headstart to understanding dispersal. Dispersal causes something to be diffused or disseminated, like the dispersal of seeds in a garden.  A strong wind could cause the dispersal of someone’s homework. A tear gas bomb causes the dispersal of tear gas, which in turn will cause the dispersal of a crowd. Anytime something is spreading out or becoming widespread, there's a dispersal at play.</li></ul>"
disperse,"<ul><li>To make a crowd at a party disperse, you could take away the food, turn off the music and ask for volunteers to clean up. Disperse is to spread out people or things, making them move in different directions.</li><li>Imagine yourself standing on a basketball court holding a cup packed tight with marbles. If you turn it over, the marbles will disperse across the floor, moving away from you in all directions. Another word for this is scatter. Don't confuse this word with disburse, which means to distribute money. Remember that false friends disperse when you cease to disburse.</li></ul>"
displace,"<ul><li>When you displace something, you move it to a new position — either in a concrete sense, like moving a chair, or in an abstract sense, like firing someone from a job.</li><li>Displace means to forcefully move or remove something  — or someone — but it can also mean “to take the place of,” again, with some force. If your brother is sitting in your seat, you might say, “Get out of my chair! Don’t make me have to displace you!” Similarly, when a new employee is hired at work, she might displace the person who had the job before.</li></ul>"
disposition,"<ul><li>Someone's disposition is their mood or general attitude about life. If your friend woke up on the wrong side of the bed, tell her that she might need a disposition makeover.</li><li>Disposition means the positive or negative way a person views the world. In contrast, your character is determined by your inner moral values, and your personality reflects what you're like as an individual. An animal with an excellent disposition is friendly towards people. If you are cheerful, you're often said to have a sunny disposition. Disposition can also mean ""getting rid of something,"" so cleaning your room might involve the disposition of empty pizza boxes and soda cans.</li></ul>"
dispute,"<ul><li>If kids can't settle their own argument, they may need someone to mediate their dispute, or conflict. You can often tell this is the case if you hear the loud cry, ""Mom!""</li><li>The noun dispute means any conflict or disagreement. The countries were in the middle of a border dispute; both sides claimed the toxic waste dump belonged to the other. As a verb, dispute can mean to quarrel or argue, but it can also mean to take exception to something. If your boasting friend crows because you lost the trivia game to her by 150 points, you may want to dispute the facts. It was only 145 points.</li></ul>"
dissipate,"<ul><li>To dissipate is to disperse or fade away — as a bad smell will dissipate (usually) if you wait long enough.</li><li>Dissipate can also mean “spend or use wastefully.” If you win the lottery, you might suddenly find yourself with a group of new friends encouraging you to dissipate your money (on them). Note that dissipate can be used with or without an object: ""Once you dissipate your wealth, your new group of friends will dissipate without a trace.""</li></ul>"
dissipated,"<ul><li>If your Great Aunt Maude tells you you've become a dissipated bum, she means you don't think of anything but how much fun you're having. If you got a summer job and stopped playing arcade games all day, she might change her tune.</li><li>The adjective dissipated is used to describe people who've lost their moral center, and instead of following the rules of conventional morals, prefer to be utterly self-indulgent. The word comes from the verb dissipate, which means ""to disperse,"" but as an adjective it's always used for people who've gone wrong in some way. If you really want to lay into someone, use these synonyms and call him a ""dissipated, dissolute, debauched, degenerate jerk.""</li></ul>"
dissuade,"<ul><li>When you dissuade someone, you convince that person not to do something: “When Caroline saw Peter's broken leg, she tried to dissuade him from going on the ski trip.”</li><li>Remember the meaning of dissuade by comparing it to its more common relative persuade. The suade part that both words share has origins in the Latin root suadēre, meaning “to urge.” In the case of persuade, the prefix per- means “thoroughly,” intensifying “to urge” and giving persuade its meaning of “to convince.” Think of dissuade as the opposite of persuade: the prefix dis- reverses the action of the root, giving the meaning of not urging, in other words, convincing someone NOT to do something.</li></ul>"
distant,"<ul><li>Distant describes something that's far away, like another planet, a ship far out at sea, or the cousin who never calls or shows up for family events.</li><li>Time, like miles, can make something distant. People get excited during awards season, but most have at best a distant recollection of who won Oscars two years ago — meaning the memory is remote. If you've ever been accused of seeming distant, how were you acting at the time? Distracted, not showing much interest or patience, bored? Too many experiences like that and once-close friends will become distant, meaning they'll drift apart.</li></ul>"
distinct,"<ul><li>When something is distinct, it is easily identifiable or set apart from others of its kind.  An eighth-grader who is six feet tall has a distinct advantage over the other kids on the basketball court.</li><li>A thing can be distinct if it is easy to see, either because it is different in some way from the things around it or if it is more clear and visible, as in: “The license number of the getaway car was more distinct once I cleaned my glasses.”  The word distinct comes from “to distinguish,” which is when a person or thing is set apart from the pack: “The research that she did was distinct in its attention to detail.”</li></ul>"
distinction,"<ul><li>When you are marked for distinction, it means you are someone who is going to do well in life. You will set yourself apart from others. Distinction means being set apart, often by excellence.</li><li>When things are distinct from one another, they are different. It is the distinctions that make them this way. In your school, an outside observer might at first be unable to see the distinctions among the kids, but with a little time they'll be able to see how kids are identified and associated with their peculiar qualities.</li></ul>"
distinctive,"<ul><li>Her big eyes and plump lips are distinctive features that make her a great model. These are just some of the special features that distinguish her.</li><li>You might recognize the Latin prefix dis in the adjective distinctive. Dis often means ""apart"" or ""away."" Think of this when trying to remember the word distinctive. Someone with distinctive features has features that set them ""apart"" from others. Yes, its stepped-back architecture and distinctive spire are among the Empire State Building's distinctive features, but its most distinctive feature has to be its height: for decades there wasn't another building in New York that came close!</li></ul>"
distinctly,
distinguish,"<ul><li>To distinguish means to tell apart. If you win the lottery, you’re going to need to learn to distinguish between people who really like you and people who like your money.</li><li>To distinguish is to discern, which means to perceive or recognize the way something differs from what’s around it. It takes discerning taste buds to distinguish between Coke and Pepsi. Distinguish also means to separate yourself out from the pack, usually in a good way. You might distinguish yourself at a Comics Convention with your encyclopedic knowledge of Krazy Kat.</li></ul>"
distribute,"<ul><li>To distribute is to disperse widely, hand out, or spread around. While you're still snoozing, the paper boy is busy distributing the newspaper all over the neighborhood.</li><li>This verb was first recorded in the early 15th century and has its roots in the Latin distributus, meaning “to divide.” Think of dividing up the last cookies in the cookie jar and passing them out to all your friends. Distribute can also mean to space out or arrange in a particular order — you'd want to distribute the chairs in even lines across the floor when setting up for a concert, for example.</li></ul>"
distribution,"<ul><li>Distribution means the passing out of something. A teacher is in charge of distribution of corrected essays. A lunch lady manages the distribution of food.</li><li>Distribution can also refer to the way something is distributed. In our country, many are concerned about the distribution of wealth, which is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the richest few. When you put money in a brokerage account, it's called a contribution. Taking it out is a distribution.</li></ul>"
disturb,"<ul><li>To disturb is to bother. If you hang a ""Do not disturb"" sign on the outside of your hotel room door, you want to be left alone.</li><li>Disturb comes from the Latin prefix dis-, meaning ""completely"" and turbare, meaning ""to disorder."" To disturb is, in a sense, to completely disorder. When you disturb something, you interfere with its normal function. Along those lines, it's also a word used to describe the interruption of sleep or relaxation. Your alarm disturbs you from sleep every morning. When something disturbs you, it can also cause you emotional anxiety.  A horror movie might disturb you with its goriness.</li></ul>"
diverse,"<ul><li>A diverse group is made up of people or things that are very different from each other. If your class mixes kids from all over the world, you could call it diverse.</li><li>The adjective diversified has the same meaning, and a near synonym is varied. An earlier spelling of the English adjective was divers, and the final –e was probably added by association with words such as traverse and converse. The word divers is still in use in the sense ""more than one, several, various:"" divers methods and styles.</li></ul>"
diversification,"<ul><li>Diversification is the opposite of sameness. Use diversification to describe the goal achieved by a store that started with deli sandwiches and now offers gourmet coffee, muffins, soups, and salads.</li><li>If a group seeks diversification, it wants to attract people of different ages from various backgrounds. If your financial adviser tells you that your stock portfolio needs diversification, this means you need to have stocks from a variety of companies and different industries. In other words, things should be more diverse. Use that to remember how to pronounce the word: Say diverse, then add if-ick-a-shun.</li></ul>"
diversify,"<ul><li>Diversify means to vary in type. It's often used to discuss risk in financial activities. You might diversify your investments by spreading your wealth among different types of stocks.</li><li>You may have noticed that diversify looks like the word diverse, an adjective that describes showing variety and difference. If you want to diversify your interests, that means you want to mix it up and do more than just play Dungeons and Dragons all the time — you might become active in sports, theater, and the math club. Diversify can also describe expanding into new areas. A company might diversify by sending its sales force into Asia and Latin America.</li></ul>"
diversity,"<ul><li>When there's diversity, there's variety. Often, this word is used for diversity of race, class, or gender.</li><li>To have diversity, you need a mix of whatever you're talking about. If you like science fiction, romantic comedies, cartoons, and action movies, then you like a diversity of types of films. If you like nothing but kung fu films, then you don't like a diversity of films. No matter what kind of diversity you're talking about, there needs to be a real mix, kind of like a huge box of Crayolas.</li></ul>"
divert,"<ul><li>To divert means to shift or turn from one thing to another. A magician might attempt to divert your attention as he shoves the rabbit into the hat.</li><li>The police will divert traffic if there has been an accident that blocks the road, and it's a good idea to divert some of your income into a savings account so you don't spend it all. Are you throwing a surprise party for a friend at his house? Have a neighbor divert him for a little while if he comes home early so that you can finish getting ready. While these uses concern physically guiding something to a different location, divert can also be used to mean ""distract"" or ""entertain."" If your friend can't stop worrying about her grades, you might want to divert her with the latest school gossip.</li></ul>"
divest,"<ul><li>It could be your wine portfolio, your stake in a mining company, or even the extra coats that are taking up space in your closet. Whatever it is, when you divest something, you get rid of it.</li><li>Divest is sort of a fancy way to say “dispose of.” It’s often used in a business context to describe companies or governments that divest some of their holdings by selling them off. It can also be used in the sense of taking something away from someone. For example if your boss becomes insane and power mad, his handlers may divest him of his title, meaning his position is taken away from him.</li></ul>"
doctrine,"<ul><li>A doctrine is a set of beliefs. The word comes from the Latin doctor for “teacher,”  so think of a doctrine is the teachings of a school, religion, or political group.</li><li>The Monroe Doctrine is the policy that President Monroe introduced in 1823 to limit European influence in the Americas. It has been a major part of U.S. foreign policy, but was revamped in 2013 by Secretary of State John Kerry in the Kerry Doctrine. Doctrine and doctor derive from the same Latin word, docere, which means ""to teach"": doctor means ""teacher,"" and doctrina means ""teaching, learning.""</li></ul>"
domestic,"<ul><li>Domestic generally means relating to someone's family, home, or home country. Domestic work is work done in the home — a domestic is someone who works in a home, such as a nanny or a maid.</li><li>Domestic is also used to refer to products that are produced in your country, or policies and affairs that relate to your country. And domestic animals, such as cats and dogs, are used to living with people. Domestic derives from Middle English, from Old French domestique, from Latin domesticus, from domus, ""house.""</li></ul>"
dormant,"<ul><li>That old dog was dormant for so long he was confused for a furry doormat, but a doormat is likely to stay dormant, or inactive, because it is lifeless: that old dog has some life in him yet.</li><li>Volcanoes are described as dormant when they stay cool for a long time, without spewing hot lava and ash. They may have the ability to come to life, but they remain dormant, or inactive. Dormant comes from French dormir, ""to sleep,"" and it refers to living things that are on a break rather than things that have died. Being dormant is being temporarily at rest, although sometimes, as with some cancer cells, things become permanently — and thankfully — dormant.</li></ul>"
dramatically,
drastic,"<ul><li>Something that is drastic is violent, forceful, and extreme. If you are saving for a car and you only have $50, you need to make a drastic change to your money accumulation scheme.</li><li>The word drastic comes from the Greek word for effective, but we use it to mean incredibly effective. If you want a drastic makeover, get rid of all your clothes, change your hair completely, and pick up a new way of speaking. Sometimes drastic action goes too far and so has bad consequences. A bankrupt company might make a drastic decision to fire the management without figuring out how to manage itself in the future.</li></ul>"
drastically,
drive,"<ul><li>To drive is to operate or travel in a motor vehicle. You can drive a car, a bus, or a go-kart.</li><li>Drive is one of those multi-functioning words with a lot of uses. In a very general sense it relates to pushing, or a push in a direction; drive and go go hand in hand. You could drive across country, drive cattle on a cattle drive, drive a golf ball by hitting it off a tee, drive prey into the open, clean your computer’s hard drive, or drive someone crazy. But do you really have the drive to do all that?</li></ul>"
dual,"<ul><li>Dual means double, or having two elements. If you have a dual major, it means you're majoring in two subjects, like astronomy and microbiology.</li><li>The adjective dual comes from the Latin duo, for two, and means having two parts. You can have a dual purpose, following two goals at once. To copilot an airplane, you need a cockpit with dual controls. If you're sometimes nasty and sometimes sugar sweet, people might think you have a dual personality. Don't confuse dual, though, with duel, which is a fight between two people.</li></ul>"
duplicate,"<ul><li>Duplicate describes something that's an exact copy. If you tend to accidentally lock yourself out of your car, it's a good idea to carry a duplicate key with you just in case.</li><li>The word duplicate is useful when you're talking about a copy of something, like a duplicate of your birth certificate that you keep in a file, or a duplicate driver's license that you apply for after losing the original one. The verb duplicate is pronounced differently, with a long a sound, and it means to make a copy of or to multiply times two. The Latin root, duplicatus, means ""to double.""</li></ul>"
durable,"<ul><li>Something that is built to last is durable. Your most durable pair of hiking boots will last you through your trek to the summit of Mount Everest.</li><li>Anything that's long-lasting, sturdy, or doesn't bend under pressure can be described as durable. You could have a durable relationship with your oldest friend, durable tires on your car, and a durable umbrella — they won't let you down or break. The Latin root of durable is durabilis, which means ""lasting or permanent,"" and comes from durare, ""to harden.""</li></ul>"
earn,"<ul><li>When you earn something, you gain it as a result of your actions. You can earn your friend's gratitude by rescuing her pet kitten from a tree.</li><li>Earning has to do with things people get through their own efforts or behavior. A good friend earns your trust. A dishonest coworker might earn a reputation as a liar. This word is also used in financial contexts. If someone asks how much you earned last year, they're asking how much money you made at your job.</li></ul>"
ease,"<ul><li>Ease means to lessen or release, often making something possible in the meantime. When you put someone at their ease, you lessen their discomfort. When you ease into a chair, you gently release yourself into it.</li><li>A life of ease means you do not have to struggle to make money. Your dad might be mad if you pierce your nose, but eventually, with time, his anger will ease and he will ease up on you. Your older siblings' behavior will ease the way for you to do things that frighten your parents without their overreacting.</li></ul>"
eccentric,"<ul><li>You're most likely to encounter the adjective eccentric in a description of an unusual or quirky person — like a scatterbrained aunt who leaves her life savings to her cat.</li><li>From the Greek ekkentros, ""out of the center,"" this word originally had to do with the orbits of planets that were observed to be slightly out of whack. Eventually it came to describe people who were a little kooky, both as an adjective and as a noun, too: an eccentric is an unconventional, odd person. Think of them as following a slightly different orbit from the rest of society.</li></ul>"
edible,"<ul><li>If it’s edible, you can eat it. Many things that you may not want to eat are, in fact, edible. Certain insects are edible, which just means that you can consume them without getting sick (if it doesn't gross you out too much).</li><li>Edible comes from the Latin word edere, which means “to eat.” Anything that people can safely eat is described as edible. Long before there were complex labels on  our packages of food, human predecessors were living in caves and sampling various plants and animals for their survival, all the while learning the hard way whether or not certain things were either edible or poisonous. You are most likely a descendant of the ones who found the edible stuff.</li></ul>"
efface,"<ul><li>If something is erased or rubbed out, it has been effaced. Teachers get annoyed to find that someone has effaced the blackboard — even the part clearly marked, ""Do Not Erase!""</li><li>You can also efface things that are not physical — like effacing feelings, impressions, or memories. When you efface a memory, you wipe it out as well. Some people believe that their good deeds are able to efface their past wrongs. They'll have to rely on others' opinions to see how well that works.</li></ul>"
elaborate,"<ul><li>Use the adjective elaborate when you want to describe how something is very detailed or especially complicated, like a devilish prank planned out weeks in advance.</li><li>The adjective elaborate is used to describe when something is planned with a lot of attention to detail or when something is intricate or detailed itself. The word comes from the Latin elaborare, which means ""to produce by labor"" but it has come to mean a lot of labor, especially work that is very complicated and precise. To imagine this word, think of a painting with lots of flourishes or a story with many sub-plots and characters that all fit together in extensive ways.</li></ul>"
elapse,"<ul><li>When time passes by, you say it elapses. Four years elapse while you are in high school. Nine months elapse while you are in the womb.</li><li>If two weeks have elapsed between your tennis lessons, there has been a two-week lapse between sessions. The word elapse comes from the Latin word elabi which means ""to slip away."" Time is one of those things that really does tend to slip away, unless you're sitting through a lecture on the nature of time. Then, it might feel like years elapse when really it is just a few minutes.</li></ul>"
element,"<ul><li>An element is something basic and important — in chemistry, an element is one of the essential molecules that everything else is made of. If a book's ending carries an ""element of surprise,"" it means surprise is an important part of the story's end.</li><li>One of the earliest meanings of this noun was in reference to any of four substances — earth, air, fire, or water — that were formerly regarded as a basic constituent of the universe. When you're ""in your element,"" it means you're enjoying yourself because what you're doing is basic and important to you. Stand-up comics are in their element when they're performing to a crowd who loves them.</li></ul>"
elevate,"<ul><li>To elevate is to lift up, either literally or figuratively. One way to elevate your mood is to exercise and elevate your heart rate. But if you exercise too hard and sprain your ankle, you might have to elevate it by propping it on a pillow.</li><li>An elevator elevates you: it carries you to a higher floor in a building. Elevate can also mean to raise something to a higher intellectual level, as when an informed speaker elevates the level of debate about an issue. A boss can elevate, or promote, a worker to a better position. For example, a restaurant manager might elevate a superb busboy to the position of waiter. Elevate comes from Latin elevates, which means “to raise” or even ""to lighten.”</li></ul>"
eliminate,"<ul><li>As eliminate means ""get rid of or do away with,"" it has become used to refer to the end of a problem or even an entire species. We need to eliminate sources of pollution in order to maintain a healthy world.</li><li>The original literal meaning of eliminate was ""to thrust over the threshold and out of doors, to kick out,"" but the 18th century saw the word expand to mean ""to exclude,"" and later to ridding the body of waste. The verb then came to refer to getting rid of anything, such as a problem or foul odor. The word took an ominous turn in the 20th century, when we saw man-made pollution eliminate whole species, and war, hate, and famine nearly eliminate whole groups of people.</li></ul>"
elite,"<ul><li>The elite are the group thought to be the best and having the highest status. In the middle ages, only elite men were taught to read and write.</li><li>There are elite schools, elite teams, and elite players, some really the best and some just calling themselves the best. Who can join the basketball elite besides LeBron James and Michael Jordan? That's a matter of opinion. Elite is used with a singular or plural verb, depending on whether these special people are considered together as a group or as individual members of a group.</li></ul>"
elusive,"<ul><li>Things that are elusive are hard to find, pin down, or remember. They slip right out of your grasp.</li><li>Ever try to catch a mouse? It's not easy, because mice are quick and elusive — they're tough to catch. Rabbits are speedy, so they're elusive too. Also, things that are tough to understand or describe are elusive — like the concepts of love and beauty. If you had an idea and then forgot it, the idea is elusive: it slipped away. Anything you can't get hold of, with your hands or with your brain, is elusive.</li></ul>"
emanate,"<ul><li>Emanate means to give off, like the sound of laughter that emanates from your sister's room during her slumber party. If spooky sounds emanate from the closet, don’t open the door!</li><li>The word emanate comes from the Latin emanare, which means “to flow out.” Things that emanate come from somewhere. Heat emanates from a fire, and smoke emanates from a chimney. This word can also be used figuratively: for example, you might say that your upbeat and optimistic best friend emanates positivity.</li></ul>"
embark,"<ul><li>When you embark on something, you are starting it — and it's exciting. You might embark on a new career or embark on a trip to the Galapagos Islands. You wouldn't embark on a trip to the grocery store.</li><li>The verb embark can be used specifically to refer to boarding a ship for a journey. When used for general travel, the verb embark often implies a longer journey: ""She embarked on a trip around the world."" Besides physical journeys, embark can be used to mean to start other kinds of journeys as well. You might embark on a spiritual journey or embark on the path to enlightenment. Pack well.</li></ul>"
embed,"<ul><li>The verb embed means to implant something or someone — like to embed a stone into a garden pathway or to embed a journalist in a military unit.</li><li>When you stick something firmly within a particular environment, you are embedding it. If you are an archeologist, you might spend a lot of your time looking for pottery shards embedded in the earth. If you are a web site designer, you might embed video clips on web pages. And if your newspaper is covering a war overseas, you might consider embedding a journalist in a military troop in order to have a source reporting back from the front lines.</li></ul>"
emergence,"<ul><li>An emergence is when something comes into view — like the emergence of a seedling in a garden or the famous emergence of Punxsutawney Phil on Groundhog Day — which is supposed to show how soon spring will ""emerge.""</li><li>Emergence is a noun that goes back to the Latin root emergere, meaning ""bring to light,"" and it came into English in the 17th century. Just as something comes to light or shows up where there was darkness or nothing before, an emergence happens — like new technologies such as the emergence of e-readers. Pronouncing emergence is the same as pronouncing emergency but without the long e sound at the end.</li></ul>"
emergency,"<ul><li>When there's an emergency, the stakes are high and you may need to act quickly. There's a tornado!  Someone's collapsed! The cat's stuck in a tree! It's an emergency! Call 911!</li><li>You can see the word emerge in emergency, and an emergency suddenly emerges — it happens all of a sudden and can take you by surprise. Governments declare a ""state of emergency"" if there is a disaster that they can't handle, and they need support. If you hear sirens and see flashing lights, there's probably an emergency . . . unless you're in a dance club.</li></ul>"
emergent,"<ul><li>If you have an emergent talent for science, your teacher might bump you up to an advanced science class. Emergent is an adjective that describes something that is emerging, or suddenly coming into existence.</li><li>Emergent means “coming into being.” It's often used in phrases like “emergent technologies.” These are brand-new technologies that we can expect to be widely used in the near future. The Internet, for example, was an emergent technology in the early 1990s. Emergent sometimes implies that what is coming into being is surprising and demands a response. An “emergent disease,” for instance, would send scientists scrambling to find a cure. In this sense emergent is related to emergency.</li></ul>"
employ,"<ul><li>To employ means to use something or hire someone to work. You can employ a saw to cut a board or employ a tutor to teach you math. You can even employ your talents in study and activities.</li><li>The Latin source of employ is the word implicāre, which literally means to enfold or be connected with. This ties in with the verb employ, which is transitive and needs a direct object. (You can't just say ""I will employ — you have to employ something.) The word also suggests using something for a specific purpose: you can employ someone for a job or find something in which to employ your own interests.</li></ul>"
enable,"<ul><li>When you make something possible, you enable it. Your good grades might enable you to get into your first-choice college. And a great teacher enabled you to get such good grades.</li><li>Enable has taken on the meaning of allowing or even helping someone continue to do something they really shouldn't. If your mother writes note after note to get you out of school for no good reason, she is enabling your habit of playing hooky. While you might think she's being cool, a therapist might call her an enabler and give her part of the blame.</li></ul>"
enactment,"<ul><li>The process of making something into a law is enactment. The enactment of new legislation in your town means that you'll now have to keep your dog on a leash in all public parks.</li><li>Enactment comes from the verb enact, which has long been used to mean ""establish as law."" This legal terminology has ""act"" at its center, meaning both ""to do"" and ""written proof of something that's been said, done, or agreed to."" Legitimizing this kind of act as law is where enactment comes in. You can also use this word for the resulting law itself: ""The enactment doesn't affect me — I never let my dog off her leash anyway.""</li></ul>"
encapsulate,"<ul><li>To encapsulate something is to sum it up in shorter form — to summarize something.</li><li>When you see the word encapsulate, think about trying to put your comic book collection inside one tiny capsule — all of them wouldn't fit, so you'd have to pick out just your favorites or the most valuable ones. Encapsulating means condensing something down into its most important parts, so you just get the gist of it. Cliff's Notes encapsulate longer books. If you tell a friend about your summer vacation, you better encapsulate it or you'll be there for hours.</li></ul>"
encounter,"<ul><li>If you run into that cute guy (or girl) from the local deli when you’re at the grocery store and you stop to chat, you’ve just had an encounter, which is a casual meeting, often resulting by chance.</li><li>When you encounter the word encounter, context will tell you if it’s acting as a verb or a noun. The sentence “When Spencer and Susanna encounter a bear on the trail, they stand very still” illustrates the verb form. “The encounter in the subway left her wishing she had stayed at home” shows the noun form. Whether acting as a verb or a noun, the word carries the connotation of “chance meeting."" You don’t plan an encounter; it just happens.</li></ul>"
encourage,"<ul><li>When you encourage someone, you give him or her the courage or confidence to do something, like when you encourage your little brother to play harder by yelling his name from the sidelines of the soccer field.</li><li>The word encourage comes from the Old French word encoragier, meaning ""make strong, hearten."" When you encourage the tomato plants in your garden, you water them to promote their growth and health. Encourage can also mean to inspire with hope, like when you encourage your friends to try out for the school play by complimenting their singing and acting talents.</li></ul>"
end,"<ul><li>The end of something is its final point or farthest edge. After your cat unwinds a ball of yarn, you may find one end of it in your kitchen and the other end upstairs in the bathroom.</li><li>A piece of string has two ends, while stories, races, and years have just one end each. When you buy a length of fabric, the leftover bit is an end, and the final point of almost anything — a play or a marriage — is also an end. When you end something, you make it conclude. In football, an ""end zone"" is the far side of the field, and a ""defensive end"" is a player near the sideline.</li></ul>"
endangered,"<ul><li>An animal that is endangered is close to extinction — meaning there aren't very many of that type of animal left in the world.</li><li>This word is used mostly to describe animal species that are not doing very well: animals usually become endangered because of over hunting or the destruction of their habitat. Environmental groups and animal-lovers try to help endangered species survive. Outside of the animal kingdom, you can say anything that seems to be dying out is endangered, like good manners, phone booths, or the art of letter writing.</li></ul>"
endeavour,"<ul><li>To endeavour is to strive for something. The endeavour itself is the thing you're striving for, the enterprise or undertaking. It's a primarily British spelling of the word.</li><li>The Middle English root of endeavour means to ""put oneself in"" or ""do one's utmost,"" so if you endeavour to do something, you do it with earnestness and a fair amount of effort. Americans usually spell the word endeavor, but NASA named one of its space shuttles the Endeavour. Why the extra ""u""? NASA was honoring the HMS Endeavour, the first ship ever used by the British explorer Captain James Cook.</li></ul>"
endorse,"<ul><li>To endorse is to give support to someone or something. ""I endorse this!"" means ""I think this is a good thing, and so should you.""</li><li>People endorse in many ways. When someone endorses a politician, it means ""You should vote for this person, and I'm putting my reputation on the line to say so."" When someone endorses a product in a commercial, it means ""Go buy this! You'll like it."" To endorse is to give support. You can also endorse a check, which means writing your name or someone else's on the back so that you or the other person can cash or deposit it.</li></ul>"
endow,"<ul><li>To endow is to furnish, but not with furniture. If you've been endowed with something, it means you've been given a gift — most likely a gift that can't be returned or exchanged, like a sense of humor or athletic ability or trust.</li><li>We usually use endow to refer to an ability or a quality, but you can endow someone with money, too. Endow is related to the word dowry, which is a gift that a man — or sometimes a woman — receives from his or her fiancé’s family before the wedding. The practice of giving dowries has fallen out of fashion in most Western countries, but there are still many parts of the world where it's common for the bride's family to provide the groom with an endowment of land and livestock.</li></ul>"
enduring,"<ul><li>Many people have an enduring love for ice cream, that is, they have loved it for a long time and will continue to love it into the future. Enduring means long-lasting.</li><li>Enduring has roots that go back about 1,500 years to the Late Latin period. It is quite an enduring word! The original root meant hard, so your enduring friendship or your enduring interest in sports is solid enough to stand the test of time. Besides meaning long-lasting, enduring sometimes means long-suffering as when someone has an enduring disposition, but this meaning is found in the verb more than in the adjective.</li></ul>"
engulf,"<ul><li>Engulf is a verb that means being completely surrounded, soaked, or covered. Fire, snow, smoke, flood waters, or even violence are a few things that could engulf you.</li><li>Suppose an amusement park had a ride called Into the Whirlpool. Sounds like one for thrill-seekers who aren't afraid of water. Riders should expect to get lost inside, fully absorbed by the experience. The word engulf comes from the Old French word golfe, meaning ""whirlpool,"" and the prefix en-, meaning ""in or into."" Riders of Into the Whirlpool should expect to feel engulfed — surrounded by water and completely covered.</li></ul>"
enhance,"<ul><li>Many people use the expression ""enhance your chance"" to point out ways to increase your chances of winning or earning a contest or prize. When you enhance something, you heighten it or make it better.</li><li>""Hance"" is not a word, but the addition of ""en-"" does something to enhance it and improve its sound. You can enhance the size of something, too, by altering it or raising it, which is what the word original meant (the ""hance"" part came via French from Latin altus, meaning ""high""). When you enhance something you take it to a higher level, like adding salt to French fries to enhance flavor or adding words to enhance your vocabulary.</li></ul>"
enjoy,"<ul><li>To enjoy something is to take delight or pleasure in something: to have fun doing it. Whatever you like or love, you enjoy.</li><li>Saying you enjoy something is a major compliment: it means you like it, and it makes you happy. Some people enjoy sports; others enjoy music. TV, movies, books, video games, sunny days, pets, and exercise are enjoyed by many people. Different people enjoy different things. We can also talk about enjoying as a type of advantage. A tall boxer enjoys an advantage because he has a longer reach than a short boxer.</li></ul>"
enlist,"<ul><li>To enlist is to voluntarily join the military. You may have seen television commercials or posters encouraging people to enlist.</li><li>There are various ways people end up in the military. Sometimes there's a draft, which selects people whether they want to go or not. Sometimes people enlist, which means they sign up on their own. Enlisting also refers to recruiting or hiring people for some purpose or organization. If you are moving, you might try to enlist your friends to help — good luck with that.</li></ul>"
enormous,"<ul><li>When something is very, very, VERY big, it can be called enormous. “Good heavens, that pimple on your cheek is absolutely enormous; it covers half your face!”</li><li>The word enormous contains within it, if you look closely, the root norm, as in normal. So what you’re saying when you call something enormous is that it’s beyond what is normal; you’re trying to convey a sense of exaggerated difference. You may also have heard the word ginormous, which people try to use as enormous with a dramatic flair. But, trust us: ginormous is not a good word; it’s just a blend of two words — gigantic and enormous.</li></ul>"
enrich,"<ul><li>To enrich something is to make it richer, or to improve the quality of it. You play the lottery because it might enrich your bank account; you play ping-pong to enrich your quality of life.</li><li>Regardless of the sense it is used in, the key to enrich is the word rich (you can almost think of it as the verb form of the adjective). So to enrich something is to make it rich, richer, or just plain better. Enrich always needs an object: You can’t visit a wax museum just to enrich, but you can go to enrich your life. Verbs that enrich include improve, enhance, cultivate, better, and develop.</li></ul>"
ensue,"<ul><li>If something happens after something else, it will ensue, meaning it will follow after or be the result. When a sneeze comes out, and he hears the ""Achoo!,"" a ""Bless you"" or ""Gesundheit"" soon will ensue.</li><li>One way to remember the verb ensue is to rhyme it with ""due."" A happening that is due to happen will ensue, ""Throwing a glass of ice water in his face guaranteed that a chase would ensue."" Often what follows is a response to words or actions, so what will ensue is what will happen as a consequence. A struggle might ensue if a thief grabs a purse, and a discussion might ensue if two sides disagree.</li></ul>"
ensuing,"<ul><li>If you go snowboarding in a leotard, prepare for an ensuing cold. Ensuing means ""coming right after, or as a result of something that happened.""</li><li>Ensuing is the adjective form of the verb ensue, which comes from the Old French ensuivre, which means ""following in."" We usually use it to show cause and effect. Blame your entrepreneurial friend who takes bets in the lunchroom for the ensuing crackdown on employee gambling. An ensuing event happens right after its cause. If a dog bites you when you're eight, and twenty years later you start having nightmares about dog bites, those aren't ensuing nightmares. They're surfacing memories.</li></ul>"
ensure,"<ul><li>When you ensure that something will happen, you guarantee it. All that homework will ensure that you have no time for fun this afternoon!</li><li>Ensure comes from the Old French en- ""make"" plus seur ""sure,"" and that is exactly what it means today - ""to make sure or certain, to guarantee."" If you ensure success or someone's safety, you are guaranteeing it. Make sure you can really come through with something before you ensure it!</li></ul>"
entail,"<ul><li>To entail is to involve. A job at a movie theater might entail sweeping popcorn off the floor, probably because watching a movie entails eating popcorn in the dark. It’s a small price to pay!</li><li>The word entail, which comes from Latin, is connected to the idea of preconditions. If you want something, you better figure out what it entails. If it’s only 8 o’clock and you want to see a movie at 9, that will entail waiting for an hour. If you want to stay out of trouble, that will entail calling your parents and letting them know you're going to be late. That’s what being responsible entails!</li></ul>"
enthusiastic,"<ul><li>Enthusiastic appreciation for something is more than just liking it — it's loving it. You're an enthusiastic fan of Italian food if you not only like it, you can't live without it.</li><li>Enthusiastic's Greek origins paint a vivid picture of how an enthusiastic person got that way, as the word literally means ""possessed by a god."" You may recognize the ""god"" part of the word — theos, as in theology — ""the study of God."" If you're enthusiastic about working on your vocabulary words, you don't have to be reminded to do it — you can't wait.</li></ul>"
entirely,
environment,"<ul><li>Think of the environment as everything that is around you. A quiet room with good lighting and no distractions is a good environment for doing homework, or at least that's what your parents and teachers think.</li><li>Environment generally refers to your surroundings. If something is good for the environment, it is beneficial to the complex system of plant and animal life, water and air on Earth. An environment need not be so large, however. The environment of your living room means the tables, chairs and decor that are in the room. Sometimes it refers to the general attitude of a place. Do you thrive in a competitive environment or prefer an atmosphere of cooperation?</li></ul>"
envision,"<ul><li>The verb envision means to imagine or picture. Kids often envision themselves doing exciting things when they grow up, like being movie stars, professional athletes, or astronauts.</li><li>The word envision comes from the Latin en-, which means ""cause to be,"" and visionem, meaning ""a thing seen."" Career paths aren't the only things that can be envisioned. If you envision a cleaner world, you may volunteer to pick up trash on the beach. If you envision a more peaceful world, you might make your brother and sister play in separate rooms to stop them from screaming at each other.</li></ul>"
ephemeral,"<ul><li>Something that is fleeting or short-lived is ephemeral, like a fly that lives for one day or text messages flitting from cellphone to cellphone.</li><li>Ephemeral (ə-FEM-ər-əl) was originally a medical term with the specific meaning ""lasting only one day,"" as a fever or sickness (Hemera means ""day"" in Greek.) The word became more general, coming to mean ""lasting a short time,"" covering the life spans of plants or insects and then eventually anything that is fleeting or transitory. A related word is the plural noun ephemera, meaning ""things that are meant to last for only a short time."" Posters for a rock concert are often ephemera, unless the band is so famous that they get saved and sold on eBay.</li></ul>"
episode,"<ul><li>Think of your favorite TV show. It runs all year long, in weekly installments. Each of those individual programs is an episode, one part of a long series.</li><li>Episode, a term from Greek tragedy, refers to a section of a story. In the 19th century, Charles Dickens published chapters of his novels in weekly magazines, episodes that together made a novel. You can also use the word for events in your own life: ""That was an unpleasant episode,"" when you're remembering a family fight, or, ""Grandpa had a fainting episode."" With the fighting and fainting, you can hope they're episodes, not the whole story.</li></ul>"
epitomize,"<ul><li>If you epitomize something, you’re a perfect example of that thing. If you never get nervous when playing basketball and can always make that last-second shot, your teammates might say you epitomize mental toughness.</li><li>A person can epitomize something — usually an abstract quality, like grace or greed — but epitomize can apply to other things as well. A popular band might epitomize the spirit of the new decade, which means it has all the main characteristics associated with the era's music, like long folksy beards, pretty harmonies, and earnest lyrics. A frustrating situation at work involving careless coworkers might make you say that they epitomize everything that’s wrong with your job.</li></ul>"
equilibrium,"<ul><li>Equilibrium is a state of balance. If you play sports so much that you don't have time for your studies, you need to study more and play less, until sports and studying reach a point of equilibrium. Or become a professional athlete.</li><li>The word equilibrium is commonly used to refer to mental or emotional balance, and a near synonym in this sense is composure. In chemistry, equilibrium is the condition existing when a chemical reaction and its reverse reaction occur at equal rates. This noun is from Latin aequilībrium, from the prefix aequi- ""equal"" plus lībra ""a balance, scale.""</li></ul>"
era,"<ul><li>An era is a period of time distinguished by a particular character. “It was the Eisenhower era, when people were more willing to serve in the military.”</li><li>Era has a couple of great things about it. First, it is used whenever you talk about dinosaurs to describe the various geologic time periods, for instance the Paleozoic Era, or the Jurassic Era. Second, it is a word beloved of crossword puzzle editors, so if you’re looking for a three-letter word for an age, look no further. Third, it sometimes confuses people who are talking about the ERA, or the Equal Rights Amendment, a vestige of the era of political feminism.</li></ul>"
eradicate,"<ul><li>To eradicate something is to get rid of it, to destroy it, and to kiss it goodbye.</li><li>Eradicate is from the Latin word eradicare meaning ""to root out."" When you yank that weed up by the roots, it has been eradicated; it's not coming back. Eradicate often means to kill a bunch of somethings, like what you want the poison to do to the roach family and their extended relatives living in your house, and what we thought we did to bedbugs. You can also eradicate corruption, poverty, or diseases. Although there are all kinds of things to get rid of, we usually want to only eradicate the bad things.</li></ul>"
erect,"<ul><li>Erect means ""build"" or ""upright."" If you erect a house, you build it. If you stand erect, you hold your body as tall as possible.</li><li>Erect comes from the Latin word erectus, meaning “upright, elevated, lofty” or “eager, alert, aroused.” Erect is a verb, as in, it will take you years to erect your replica of the Eiffel Tower using only gum and toothpicks. Erect is also an adjective, as in something that is tall, firm, straight or rigid, like a half-dead plant that becomes more erect when you water it.</li></ul>"
erratic,"<ul><li>The adjective erratic describes things that are unpredictable, unusual, and that deviate from the norm. An erratic quarterback might completely confuse his receivers waiting for a pass.</li><li>Like its linguistic relative, error, the adjective erratic means ""deviating from the norm,"" or ""wrong."" It also implies behavior or qualities that are unpredictable or odd. The word comes from the Latin verb errare, or ""to wander"" off course. In the field of geology, a rock that is erratic is unlike others in its environment because it has been transported by glacial activity. Likewise, someone driving a car that veers out of its lane is said to be driving erratically.</li></ul>"
erroneous,"<ul><li>The adjective erroneous describes something or someone as mistaken and incorrect. Early explorers had the erroneous notion that the oceans were full of dragons.</li><li>When we talk about being on the ""straight and narrow path"" we aim to live a truthful and moral life. The Latin root of erroneous, or ""to be incorrect"" as well as ""to be immoral,"" is errare, which means ""to wander."" It's clear that we make connections between behavior and direction or space. These two ideas have been linked for a very long time!</li></ul>"
escalate,"<ul><li>If an argument between you and your brother progresses from mean looks to a fist fight, you could say that the tension between the two of you escalated. To escalate is intensify or increase quickly.</li><li>When you see this word, picture an escalator that takes you up to the next floor quickly. But remember, there's something you don't like on that higher level because it's usually bad if something escalates. Prices escalate when something becomes scarce, be it a popular toy, a concert ticket, or food during a crisis. And if a war or conflict escalates, it becomes more intense and violent.</li></ul>"
essential,"<ul><li>Essential means very basic or necessary. A good frying pan is one of a short list of kitchen essentials every cook must have. To prevent fires, it's essential to turn off appliances before leaving the house.</li><li>The adjective essential is often followed by to or that: It is essential to wash your hands. It is essential that you dry them after. This adjective is from Middle English essencial, from Late Latin essentialis, from Latin essentia ""the basic nature of a thing, its essence"" plus the Latin suffix -alis ""relating to.""</li></ul>"
essentially,"<ul><li>Notice the tie between essentially and the word ""essence,"" referring to the very core of something. As an adverb, then, essentially refers to something's nature.  In spite of your faults, you're essentially a good person.</li><li>The word essentia came from the Lower Latin, referring to something's inherent qualities.  If you're convinced that there's not much difference between two things, you might say that they are essentially the same.  Nietzsche once made the essentially sexist comment, ""Man wishes woman to be peaceable, but in fact she is essentially warlike, like the cat.”</li></ul>"
established,"<ul><li>Something or someone well established is well known, totally trusted and usually has a proven track record of success.</li><li>Becoming established doesn't happen overnight. You've got to put in the time and effort to prove yourself, make connections and build a good reputation. So it makes sense that this adjective is related to the verb establish, which means to ""create, set up, or prove."" Established is a handy word to know, especially when you're looking for a dentist — you probably won't want to try Dr. Lovedrill until his practice is more established.</li></ul>"
establishment,"<ul><li>Kids were more comfortable in school after the establishment of a no-tolerance bullying policy in the cafeteria. Establishment means setting up or something that has been set up.</li><li>In the 1960s, the youth movement took on what they called ""the establishment,"" by which they meant the way society was set up and organized. Their sentiments could be summed up in a word that is rumored to be one of the longest in the English language, if it actually exists: disestablishmentarianism.</li></ul>"
estimate,"<ul><li>A rough calculation or appraisal is an estimate. When you hit another baseball through the kitchen window, your parents will get an estimate of the repair costs. And you should estimate being grounded for approximately 3 weeks.</li><li>An estimate is kind of like a very educated guess. Making an estimate takes good evaluation skills, and usually estimates are pretty close to the actual outcome. If the garage bill is way higher than the estimate they gave you, for example, you have a right to be angry. But if you forgot to factor in rush hour traffic when you estimated the drive from Boston to New York, that's your own fault.</li></ul>"
estimation,"<ul><li>The noun estimation refers to a judgment of the qualities of something or someone. In your estimation no boy will be good enough for your daughter. He could be the kindest and smartest person on the planet and you'd still find fault.</li><li>The noun estimation has its Latin roots in aestimare, meaning ""to value."" One of the definitions for estimation is an approximate calculation of something's value. If you go to an auction, you can often review a catalog that will have an estimation of the value of each item for sale. Sometimes the items sell for more than the estimation and sometimes less. The auctioneer hopes there are many bids for the pair of stone lions, but if you're bidding, you hope you're the only one who wants them.</li></ul>"
euphoric,"<ul><li>To be euphoric is to be carried away with amazingly good feelings.  The euphoric feeling of having won the lottery ended quickly when you saw your pet ferret chewing up your lottery ticket.</li><li>When someone's euphoric, they're so happy that they might have lost touch with reality for the moment.  This “too good to be true” quality is one reason some drug-induced states get described as euphoric.  In fact, euphoria, which euphoric stems from, originally meant a feeling of wellness caused in the sick by the use of drugs.</li></ul>"
evaluate,"<ul><li>When you evaluate something, you're making a judgment, one that most likely results from some degree of analysis.</li><li>Breaking down the nutritional pros and cons of dessert options is evaluating. Diving into a tub of Ben and Jerry's because you have a craving is not.

The word evaluate was used as a mathematics term before it became part of standard usage. Thus, its wonky connotation of objectivity.</li></ul>"
eventual,"<ul><li>The adjective eventual is used to describe something that is likely to happen in the indefinite future. If you are a teen, you can't wait for your eventual graduation from high school, but later, you'll look back fondly on those same high school days.</li><li>Eventual implies that the result will occur due to circumstances already set in motion or if a given set of circumstances happens. In other words, eventual is not used to randomly predict the future. You may hope to win the lottery in the future, but you can't talk about your eventual lottery win because you have no way to guarantee your numbers will be chosen — unless you've figured out a way to rig the system. If you have, maybe you should think about your eventual jail time.</li></ul>"
eventually,"<ul><li>Eventually refers to an unspecific time when something will be completed, and it usually suggests it won't be done soon.</li><li>Think of eventually being said with a big sigh, as though the speaker knows that it will take a long time before something will be finished. Still, it does allow for the hope that, although it might not be anytime soon, it will be done at last — a promise fulfilled. Not now, maybe, but eventually.</li></ul>"
ever-shifting,
evidence,"<ul><li>Evidence is anything that can be used to prove something — like the evidence presented in a trial, or the trail of bread crumbs that is evidence of the path Hansel took through the woods.</li><li>The word evidence is derived from the Latin ēvidēnt-, meaning ""obvious."" The word evidence shows up frequently in legal documents and dramas, because evidence is necessary proof in linking someone to a crime or crime scene. Evidence is used in many ways to show that something is true, as in ""the chocolate stains around your mouth and the crumbs on the table are evidence that you ate the last of the brownies.""</li></ul>"
evident,"<ul><li>If something is evident, it's visible. If you blush furiously and start shaking every time your crush comes near, your infatuation will be evident to everyone.</li><li>Evident means conspicuously visible, often the mark of an action or a feeling. If a room is in total disarray, with everything pulled out of the drawers, it's evident that someone has been searching for something. If you leave the room in the middle of a tense meeting, your frustration will be evident. Evident can also simply mean visible. If you look closely at a key hole of your car door, small scratches will be evident in the paint.</li></ul>"
evoke,"<ul><li>The verb evoke most commonly means to bring a feeling, memory, or picture into the mind. When you visit your old elementary school, the smells, sounds, and colors there can evoke memories from the past.</li><li>Similarly, a certain reaction can be evoked by words or actions, as in ""His comments evoked anger in the community."" A near synonym is elicit, as in ""No matter how many different ways the detective questioned the suspect, he could not elicit any response. Evoke was borrowed from Latin evocare, from the prefix e- ""out,"" plus vocare ""to call.""</li></ul>"
evolve,"<ul><li>When something evolves, it changes, or develops over time, like your taste in music and clothes, which evolve as you get older.</li><li>Evolve comes from the Latin word evolvere, ""to unroll"" — the perfect image to keep in mind when thinking of this verb. When something is unrolling or unraveling, it is doing so gradually, not all at once. Evolve describes a development that is taking its time to reach its final destination. Think change with a speed limit. Your taste in music evolved from the nursery rhymes you loved as a little kid to whatever you like today. Even places can evolve, like the old-fashioned coffee shops that evolved into Internet cafés as people began to bring their laptops with them.</li></ul>"
exaggerate,"<ul><li>When you exaggerate you stretch the truth. Fishermen tend to exaggerate the size of their fish. And children tend to exaggerate the seriousness of their cuts in order to get cute Band-Aids.</li><li>We all have a tendency to exaggerate. It makes our stories funnier, or more dramatic. After all, when you exaggerate, you're not really lying — you're just overstating things. The word exaggerate can also suggest that a particular characteristic is overdone or almost larger than life. If you describe someone as having an exaggerated limp, he or she might be walking like a gorilla.</li></ul>"
excavate,"<ul><li>To excavate is to remove or find by digging. If you have rocky soil in your garden, you may have to excavate it to remove the rocks and replace them with additional soil.</li><li>Construction crews also excavate when they remove material from the ground. Workers slowly excavate subways tunnels using explosives to break up the rock and earth. Then the workers clear away the materials, hollowing out a tunnel as they go. It often takes a lot of time and effort to excavate. But most people would agree a new subway line is dynamite!</li></ul>"
excavation,"<ul><li>Excavation is the act or process of digging, especially when something specific is being removed from the ground. Archaeologists use excavation to find artifacts and fossils.</li><li>There are many types of excavation, but they all involve digging holes in the earth. Mining for coal, gold, or diamonds all require excavation, and before buildings and houses can be built, there is often some excavation that's done before a foundation can be poured. The Latin source of excavation is excavationem, ""a hollowing out,"" from excavare, ""to hollow out,"" with its roots of ex-, ""out,"" and cavare,  ""to hollow.""</li></ul>"
exceed,"<ul><li>To exceed is to go beyond expectations, or to go too far. If you exceed the speed limit, you might get a speeding ticket.</li><li>Exceed and excess share the Latin root excedere meaning to ""go beyond.""  An excess is too much of something, like the piles of candy after Halloween, and exceed means the action of going too far in a good or bad way. You exceed in school when you get straight A's. When Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde, he experiences ""a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death."" No thanks! It helps to remember that like speed, exceed ends with -eed.</li></ul>"
exceedingly,"<ul><li>Use the adverb exceedingly to mean ""very."" You might brag, for example, that you did exceedingly well on the big math test last week.</li><li>Exceedingly means ""to a very large degree,"" so it's best to save it for things that really need to be emphasized. You might be exceedingly angry at your little sister after she borrowed your favorite sweater and spilled ketchup on it, or exceedingly happy to have gotten into your first choice college. Exceedingly has a Latin root, excedere, ""depart, go beyond, be in excess, or surpass.""</li></ul>"
exceptionally,
excess,"<ul><li>Excess is too much of something, like big-time overindulgence. Eating to excess makes your stomach hurt, and spending to excess means you can't pay your credit card bills.</li><li>Excess comes from the Latin word excessus meaning, ""go out, going beyond the bounds of reason,"" like eating and spending in excess. (Not so reasonable.) Although it spends most of its time as a noun, it can also be an adjective to describe ""more than is required or needed,"" like when excess water spills over the top of the bathtub, or those excess pounds spill over the top of your jeans.</li></ul>"
exclusively,"<ul><li>Something occuring exclusively is only happening or available in one special circumstance, like a song that’s exclusively for sale on one web page, but not anywhere else.</li><li>Something exclusive is only available in one way, like a newspaper with an exclusive interview no one else was able to get. Things happening exclusively are also available in a select way—not for everyone. If a boxing match is shown exclusively on pay-per-view, it’s shown only on pay-per-view. If I work exclusively for one company, I don’t work for any other companies. If a singer sings exclusively at one club, that’s the only place to hear her.</li></ul>"
excrete,
execute,"<ul><li>To execute means to carry out in full or perform. If you execute all the difficult steps of the dance perfectly, you will make your instructor proud.</li><li>Here’s what’s tricky about execute: the first thing you think of is being punished with death for criminal actions. Actually, it's more commonly used in the sense of “to carry out in full.” So don't be alarmed with visions of the hooded guy at the guillotine when someone congratulates you on a plan well executed. Think of the word executive to get a closer grasp of both the meaning and the context.</li></ul>"
exercise,"<ul><li>Exercise is physical activity, like an exercise class, or the act of practicing anything — like people who exercise caution while crossing the street.</li><li>If your dad tells you to exercise restraint in dealing with your brother who just broke your computer, he hasn't suggested that you tie your brother up — here exercise means ""use"" or ""practice."" This might remind you of the writing exercises your teacher gave you: practice in forming letters. In many kinds of exercise, the results come from doing something over and over — just ask anyone who exercises, or works out.</li></ul>"
exert,"<ul><li>Exert basically means to put forth effort to do something. For example, when you exert yourself in a workout, you can really feel the burn in your muscles.</li><li>The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which is the source of our word — means to ""put forth."" That's where exert gets its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard at something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But exert can refer to other ways you ""push"": you exert your influence to convince others to think your way; when one nation exerts its power on another; and gravity exerts its force on us, holding us down on earth.</li></ul>"
exhausted,"<ul><li>Up too late studying? Want nothing more than to get a little bit of sleep? Sounds like you're exhausted — all of your energy has been used up. Exhausted is spent, drained, and depleted.</li><li>Though you might associate the word exhausted with people, it's a word that can be used to talk about anything that's depleted. You might want to continue traveling around Europe, but if your funds are exhausted, it's time to go home. If you're trying to get in touch with the airline so you can make a reservation for your homeward-bound trip, your patience may become exhausted after being placed on hold for hours.</li></ul>"
exhibit,"<ul><li>An exhibit is an item that is shown off for the public, such as a painting on display at a gallery or a historical document shown under glass at a museum.</li><li>The main thing to remember about an exhibit is that it refers to something presented formally and in a public setting. For example, if you put an action figure on a side table in your apartment and your friends come by and notice it, well, it’s just an action figure on a side table. Put that same action figure on a pedestal in a fancy gallery, arrange it just so, and voilà! It’s an exhibit. People may even look it over and discuss its meaning in hushed tones. Students of law — or people who watch a lot of TV — will know that when used in a legal context, the word exhibit can also refer to an item presented as evidence in a legal court.</li></ul>"
expand,"<ul><li>The verb expand means to make something bigger or wider. It might refer to something concrete, as when you blow into a balloon and make it expand, or something more abstract, as when you study to expand your mind.</li><li>Expand is a combination of the Latin words ex-, meaning ""out,"" and pandere, ""to spread."" The idea of spreading out was always there, though the current idea of something actually becoming larger was first recorded in the mid-17th century. Expand is a versatile word that can refer to anything getting bigger, from a nation's growing influence in a neighboring country to a waistline that needs a larger belt.</li></ul>"
expanse,"<ul><li>An expanse is a huge area you can look at all at once. If you climb to the top of a mountain, suggest that your fellow climbers take time to admire the expanse of trees below.</li><li>Expanse looks like the word expand. Both come from the Latin word expandere, meaning ""to spread out, unfold."" But where did expandere come from? Ex- means ""out"" and pandere means ""spread or stretch."" So an expanse is something that seems to unfold before your eyes, or to put it another way, something that stretches out as far as the eye can see.</li></ul>"
expansive,"<ul><li>Expansive is all about being able to grow or get larger. An expansive piece of land is large, an expansive mind is one that is always thinking of the big picture, an expansive vocabulary is one that holds lots of words.</li><li>Warning: don't confuse expansive, ""large,"" with expensive, ""high priced."" They differ by only one letter but mean very different things. A Big Mac may contain what McDonald's advertizes as an expansive all-beef patty, but it isn't expensive food.</li></ul>"
expediency,"<ul><li>Expediency gets you what you want.  While its tone can be neutral, expediency often suggests self-interest, possibly at the expense of doing what's right.</li><li>Expediency comes from the word expedient, which derived from the Latin expedientem, meaning ""beneficial.""  The negative aspect of the word came about in the 18th Century, taking on the aspect of doing something in the most convenient and advantageous manner, even though that way might be against conventional ethics.  As W. Somerset Maugham once wrote, “The most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency.”</li></ul>"
expedient,"<ul><li>The adjective expedient describes something that provides an easy way to achieve a goal or result, but it's not necessarily a moral solution.</li><li>Politically expedient means something you do to advance yourself politically. Use expedient when you want to hint that a particular solution or strategy has certain benefits and advantages but is not completely fair. However, expedient can also be used as a noun to describe something practical for a particular purpose.</li></ul>"
expend,"<ul><li>The verb expend means to use. If you expend all your energy raking the leaves, you may be too tired to play hockey afterwards. Better pace yourself — you'll never get all of the leaves on the ground, after all.</li><li>The verb expend means to spend or pay out. You can expend money, but you can also expend things like good will and time. As a voter, you can vote for or against the city's plan to expend money on a new library building, but the city may be expending voter willingness to support the plan if the building goes over the budget. There is no point in building a library if they can't afford to buy books!</li></ul>"
explicit,"<ul><li>Anything explicit is completely clear and includes details. If you don't want your little brother to become a snake snack, you'll need to give him explicit instructions for feeding your pet boa constrictor safely.</li><li>This adjective describes anything that is clear, detailed, and easy to understand. Explicit orders are easy to carry out, and explicit directions are easy to follow. When someone is explicit, they're not beating around the bush or being confusing. Explicit can also mean ""offensive"" or ""graphic,"" a description that is sometimes included in parental-advisory warnings about ""explicit language"" or ""explicit violence"" in movies.</li></ul>"
explicitly,"<ul><li>When you explain something explicitly, you do it in great detail, leaving no room for misunderstanding. You could intimidate your little brother by explicitly describing what you'll do if he reads your diary.</li><li>Something that's said or done explicitly is clear and direct, like an explicitly told story about terrible poverty in India — it leaves out no disturbing details, even if it upsets the listener. Explicitly can also refer to sexual situations or details, like a movie whose sex scenes are shown explicitly, or graphically. The Latin root is explicare, ""unfold, unravel, explain.""</li></ul>"
exploit,"<ul><li>An exploit is a heroic act or notable deed. The King Arthur legends are full of stories of the exploits of the Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Lancelot and King Arthur himself.</li><li>This noun is from Middle English expleit, ""outcome,"" from Latin explicitus, ""unfolded, set forth."" The verb exploit means to use someone or something, usually selfishly or for profit. Workers who are tired of being exploited by factory owners form unions that allow them to stand together as a powerful force.</li></ul>"
explore,"<ul><li>Explore is a verb that means ""to travel in or through."" You might explore an island, a European city, or the rooms of an unfamiliar house.</li><li>The Latin root of explore is explorare, meaning ""investigate or search out."" When you explore a new place, you want to see interesting things and get to know its people. Whenever you delve into something, or investigate it, you explore it. You can even explore an interest, like when you explore African art, or explore an idea or tendency in order to understand it — you can explore your fear of snakes to try to get over it.</li></ul>"
expose,"<ul><li>To expose means to uncover or allow to be in the open air. If you take off your coat and expose your bare arms to the terrible cold, your tattoos might freeze off. (Note: We don’t actually know if this is physically possible.)</li><li>When you pronounce expose as it’s spelled, it can mean to leave out in the air, to put in peril (when you expose someone to danger), or to uncover. All of those examples are actions. However, when you pronounce it as though there is a French accent on the final ""e,"" ex-poh-ZAY, it means the unmasking or exposure of something hidden (and usually bad or fraudulent), as when you watch an expose on 60 Minutes about the evils of frozen orange juice or some other toxic substance.</li></ul>"
express,"<ul><li>When something goes fast, it goes express — like a train that skips many stops. You also express your feelings and thoughts.</li><li>When you want something sent quickly, send it by express mail. When you give your opinion, you're expressing yourself. Writing music and poems are also examples of expressing yourself. Mathematical formulas express complex ideas. In genetics, a gene might be expressed by making you bald.</li></ul>"
extant,"<ul><li>Use the adjective extant to describe old things that are still around, like your extant diary from third grade or the only extant piece of pottery from certain craftspeople who lived hundreds of years ago.</li><li>Extant is the opposite of extinct: it refers to things that are here — they haven't disappeared or been destroyed. Use extant to describe things that it may be surprising to learn are still around — you wouldn't say jeans you bought last year are extant, but a pair of jeans worn by Marilyn Monroe back in the 1950s? Definitely extant.</li></ul>"
extend,"<ul><li>The verb extend can have several related meanings, including thrust out, continue, broaden, expand, unfold, span, or increase in scope.</li><li>Extend, as a verb, is used in many ways. You extend (hold out) your hand when you offer to shake. You extend (push forward) a deadline when you add a few days to it. Your belly might extend (broaden) after a holiday dinner. A telescope extends (expands) your range of vision. If the list of definitions for extend were infinite, you could extend (add to) that list forever and ever. But your patience might not extend that far.</li></ul>"
extensive,"<ul><li>When something is far-reaching or expansive it is extensive.  When your friend knows every single place and time that his favorite band has played any given song, he has extensive knowledge of that band.</li><li>Use the adjective extensive for something that goes on and on and on.  It works for anything that covers a lot of territory either in physical space, as in ""the gardens at the palace are extensive,"" or conceptually, as in ""her knowledge of the mortgage-backed securities market is extensive.""  If you are a farmer, you would also use extensive to mean that you are able to work a lot of land without too much effort or manual labor.</li></ul>"
extol,"<ul><li>If you have a crush on a guy who likes your best friend, it can be very depressing to listen to him extol your friend's virtues, while you just nod and smile. If you extol something, you praise it very highly.</li><li>The Bible says: ""Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven..."" Nebuchadnezzar II was king of the second Babylonian Empire, the one who sent the Jews into exile. In some translations of the Bible, the word honor is replaced with glorify. Praise, extol, honor, glorify all mean about the same. The Bible often uses five words when one would be enough.</li></ul>"
extraneous,"<ul><li>Extraneous means coming from the outside, like the extraneous noise you hear when you're in a theater and a train passes by. Extraneous can also mean not relevant or essential, like all the extraneous information in your long-winded science report.</li><li>In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary ""outside the ordinary,"" or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus points––ding! ding!––if you knew that terra is Latin for ""earth."") The meaning of extraneous also extends to more abstract things that come from the outside: extraneous details are ones that don't matter.</li></ul>"
extraordinary,"<ul><li>Something extraordinary goes above and beyond what is expected. This can be good or bad. Saving a child from a burning building is an extraordinary act of heroism, but a test score of 11 out of 100 is extraordinary too.</li><li>The extra- in extraordinary means ""outside"" the ordinary. If you had to work for 10 hours on a two-page writing assignment, that means it was an extraordinarily hard assignment. Either that or you were extraordinarily slow. We often use the word extraordinary as a superlative. If your friend bakes you a cake better than any you’ve ever tasted, you could tell her it is “extraordinary.”</li></ul>"
exude,"<ul><li>To exude is to give off small amounts, usually of liquids or gases, through small openings, such as pores. Think of how you exude sweat after a workout.</li><li>The word exude is often used to describe sweating — the original Latin root, sudāre means ""to sweat."" Still, we frequently use the word exude to refer to anything that seems to ooze or pour forth from an object or person. John F. Kennedy was said to exude confidence, while his wife, Jackie, exuded class. But the verb can also have a negative sense, as when we say a skunk exudes a foul smell.</li></ul>"
fabricate,"<ul><li>Do you like to construct mini airplanes from kits? Work on an assembly line? Piece together Ikea furniture? Then you certainly know how to fabricate, or to put together, things.</li><li>While fabricate might mean the physical act of construction, it can also mean constructing a falsehood. Watch out — those well versed in the art of fabrication might have an ulterior motive. In the movies, the bad cops sometimes fabricate evidence to make the good guy look guilty. When you tell the teacher the dog ate your homework, you’ve fabricated a pretty silly excuse. So if you’re going to fabricate the truth, get some better material!</li></ul>"
facet,"<ul><li>A facet is one side or aspect of something. If you’re thinking about quitting your day job to become a circus performer, you should first consider every facet of what your new life would be like.</li><li>Facet, which is related to the word face, can also refer to one of the flat “faces” of a diamond or other gem. This was the word’s original definition, and it was evidently seen as an apt metaphor for one side of a complex idea. When a problem has many parts to consider (or when it’s just a huge mess), you can describe it as multifaceted.</li></ul>"
fair,"<ul><li>When used as a noun, fair refers to a traveling show with games, rides, and farmers showing off their prized pigs, similar to a carnival. As an adjective, it gets a bit trickier.</li><li>The adjective fair, has several different meanings. If someone says, ""That's not fair!” they mean whatever happened wasn't just or done in an unbiased way. If you have fair skin, you have a pale complexion. If the weather is fair, it's a gorgeous day out. If the rides at the fair were fair, then they were just so-so. And watch out if the umpire shouts ""fair ball!"" during the baseball game — that means it was hit within the foul lines.</li></ul>"
faithful,"<ul><li>Faithful describes someone who is reliable and consistent. If you're a faithful volunteer at the animal shelter, you show up every Saturday and work hard to help the animals.</li><li>A faithful friend is loyal and steadfast — it's no wonder that many people consider their dogs to be their most faithful companions. Though faithful usually describes a person, you can also use it to talk about a particularly reliable object, like your faithful hiking boots. There's another sense of faithful that means ""remaining true to,"" like faithful believers who pray and attend religious services regularly.</li></ul>"
far-reaching,
fascinating,"<ul><li>Something fascinating really captures your interest: you can't take your eyes off it or can't wait to learn more about it.</li><li>To a sports fan, a basketball game may be fascinating, including the smallest details, like who got the most assists and what kind of defense was played. Music fans find concerts fascinating. Many people think politics is fascinating — they can't get enough TV and magazine stories about the latest political events. Whatever you think is fascinating, it must really hold your attention: you always want to see and know more.</li></ul>"
fashion,"<ul><li>The word fashion has to do with customs and trends. Popular clothes are in fashion. And someone who keeps up with the latest styles is a follower of fashion.</li><li>The most common use of fashion is to describe the hippest, trendiest clothes and music — we say popular things are in fashion. But this word can also refer to a way something is done, as in ""We train dogs in a certain fashion."" To fashion something means to built it, as in ""We fashioned a shelter out of rocks and mud."" But that kind of fashioning probably isn't in fashion these days.</li></ul>"
fashion,"<ul><li>The word fashion has to do with customs and trends. Popular clothes are in fashion. And someone who keeps up with the latest styles is a follower of fashion.</li><li>The most common use of fashion is to describe the hippest, trendiest clothes and music — we say popular things are in fashion. But this word can also refer to a way something is done, as in ""We train dogs in a certain fashion."" To fashion something means to built it, as in ""We fashioned a shelter out of rocks and mud."" But that kind of fashioning probably isn't in fashion these days.</li></ul>"
fashionable,"<ul><li>Something that's fashionable is in style. Your cousin might insist that wearing wide-brimmed fishing hats is very fashionable right now.</li><li>Things that are very trendy or popular are fashionable, whether they're a brand of jeans or a particular baked good that everyone seems to be eating. A person who follows these trends can also be described as fashionable: 
""Did you see John walk by wearing those yellow boots and eating a huge doughnut? He's so fashionable."" The noun fashion is at the root of fashionable, with its Old French origin, façon, ""face, appearance, design, or beauty.""</li></ul>"
feasible,"<ul><li>If something is feasible, then you can do it without too much difficulty. When someone asks ""Is it feasible?"" the person is asking if you'll be able to get something done.</li><li>Feasible things are possible. If you have enough time, money, or energy to do something, it's feasible. Something might be feasible at one time and then not feasible at another time. Because of technological advances and competition with the Russians, going to the moon was feasible for the United States in the sixties. Often, people disagree about what's feasible, especially in politics, where how feasible a project is counts for a lot.</li></ul>"
feast,"<ul><li>A feast is a huge, delicious meal that's served at a party or celebration. You might have a feast to celebrate the last day of school every year.</li><li>You can use the word feast in several different ways. It's good for describing the meal you eat at a party, or as a verb meaning ""to eat in celebration."" You might feast for several days during your family reunion. You can also use feast figuratively to mean a delight, as when you say, ""Your garden is a feast for the eyes, Grandma."" The Latin root, festa, means ""holidays or feasts,"" from festus, ""festive, joyful, or merry.""</li></ul>"
ferry,"<ul><li>A ferry is a boat that carries people, cars, and cargo back and forth across a body of water. The Staten Island Ferry ferries commuters from Manhattan to Staten Island every ten minutes during rush hour.</li><li>To ferry means to transport by ferry, or to transport in other ferry-like ways, i.e., multiple short trips. If you have an ice-skating birthday party, your dad might ferry a few van loads of kids back to your house afterward, for pizza and cake.</li></ul>"
fertile,"<ul><li>The word fertile means ""able to reproduce,"" but like so many words, that's just the beginning. The fact that she gave birth to eight kids was proof that she was fertile; her fertile imagination explained their unusual names.</li><li>The distance between fertile's literal meaning (able to make babies) and its figurative ones (productive, prolific, full of potential) is small. A child's mind is a fertile place; an idea can grow there very easily. Rabbits are famously fertile creatures; they can spawn several generations in a matter of months. And ""fertile ground"" can be arable land or a situation that provides the perfect opportunity. The Latin root, fertilis, means ""bearing in abundance, fruitful, or productive,"" from ferre, ""to bear.""</li></ul>"
figure out,"<ul><li>To figure out is to investigate or think something through in order to understand it. You might figure out through a little online sleuthing that your kindergarten teacher moved to Alaska and became a salmon fisherman.</li><li>You can figure out the answer to a tricky math problem using a calculator, and you can figure out how old you were when you visited Disney World by looking at photographs and consulting your parents. This informal phrase comes in handy whether you're finding the solution for a big problem or simply puzzling out something small, like when you figure out which kind of treat your dog likes best.</li></ul>"
finding,"<ul><li>A finding is a discovery, especially by scholars or scientists. Finding is the act of researching or analyzing something. If the dog digs up the hamster grave in the backyard, better not to share his finding with the neighbors.</li><li>Findings are facts that have been found, especially by academics studying something. A dietary study could have the finding that more people are avoiding gluten. An economic study could have the finding that more people are working out of their home. An environmental study could have the finding that a type of toxin is increasing. A dog’s finding would be a little less academic. The word is usually plural, because it usually refers to more than one thing found.</li></ul>"
first and foremost,
flake,"<ul><li>A flake is a tiny piece of something. A flake could be a tasty morsel like a croissant flake, or a not so tasty morsel — like a dandruff flake. Ewww.</li><li>In some places, you can see flakes of mica, a shiny glimmering mineral, lining the banks of a pond or paths through the woods. There are also croissant flakes, dandruff flakes, and of course snow flakes, individual snow crystals. When something flakes, it comes off in tiny flecks: ""The paint had started to flake off the kitchen wall."" If someone calls you a flake, they basically mean you're a weirdo.</li></ul>"
flattery,"<ul><li>Flattery is excessive praise. If you're hoping to borrow your brother's car, be careful not to overdo it when you compliment his haircut, new shoes, and singing voice — he knows flattery when he sees it.</li><li>As opposed to real praise, flattery is insincere and almost always has an ulterior motive. The Old English root word of flatter is flater, which originally meant ""to stroke with the hand or caress."" When you stroke someone's ego to get what you want, you're using flattery. If the person you are wildly complimenting tells you that flattery will get you nowhere, you know it's time to back off.</li></ul>"
flee,"<ul><li>If you bolt, scram, skedaddle, or get the heck of out Dodge, you flee. You run away fast. Don’t confuse flee with ""flea."" They sound alike, but the second kind is an insect whose bites make you itch.</li><li>We get the word flee from Old English fleon. When you flee, you get away as quickly as you can. You might even take flight to escape — usually from a dangerous place or situation. In a moment of panic after stealing a cookie from the cookie jar, you might decide to flee the scene of the crime.</li></ul>"
flexible,"<ul><li>Something that is flexible is easily bent without breaking. The flexible drinking straw was invented in the 1930s by a man who saw his daughter struggling to drink a milkshake with a straight paper straw.</li><li>The word flexible can refer to bendable physical objects or to intangibles like a person's mind, which can be changed. It can even refer to work environments that can adapt schedules and benefits to fit a worker's individual needs. Being physically flexible usually means good health, with no pain in movement. In all, it's great to be flexible, to be able to bend without breaking and bounce back, ready to keep going.</li></ul>"
float,"<ul><li>Float is what you do when you're lying on the water. Hopefully you know how to swim, so you can float suspended on the surface of the water, rather than sinking straight to the bottom.</li><li>We typically think of the verb float as something you do on the surface of an ocean or pool, but it's possible to float in mid-air too. You just need to be attached to a parachute so you don't come crashing down to the ground. You can also ""float on air"" in a more figurative sense. For example, if the person you're in love with suddenly gives you flowers, you could float around for hours feeling like your feet aren't touching the ground.</li></ul>"
flourish,"<ul><li>A flourish is an extra touch — a trumpet's ""ta-ta-da!"" announcing a king's entrance, a fancy carving atop an otherwise utilitarian pillar, a wave of a flag or a cheerleader's pompom.</li><li>Flourish can also mean ""growth"": ""With the right teacher, a child will flourish."" To understand how the two meanings of flourish connect, remember that the word ""flower"" (spelled flour-) is hiding inside it. Flowers are used for decoration and ornamentation, but they also grow. Get it? Good for you! Imagine a cheerleader shouting out your name, flourishing her pom-poms.</li></ul>"
flourishing,"<ul><li>When something is flourishing, it's healthy or successful. Your flourishing lemonade stand is especially busy on hot summer afternoons.</li><li>A flourishing rose bush has glossy green leaves and bright blossoms, and a city's flourishing music scene means you can see live bands every weekend and hear many different types of music. This adjective is used today for anything that's thriving or prospering, but originally it meant ""full of flowers,"" from the Latin root flos, ""a flower.""</li></ul>"
flow,"<ul><li>The word flow has many shades of meaning but most involve the steady movement of something. Water can flow in a river, electricity can flow through a wire, and talk might also flow as you sit and chat with friends.</li><li>The verb flow often describes the movement of fluids, such as water or even blood, but it can also describe other things that move in a constant stream. When you get that high-paying job, money might flow into your bank account. Until then, offers for help might flow in when you need to pay your credit card bill. Flow has a noun form as well. You might watch the flow of traffic on the street.</li></ul>"
fluctuate,"<ul><li>Something that fluctuates varies or changes — it's the opposite of steady. Like the ups and downs of the stock market or the relationship status of a Hollywood starlet.</li><li>Fluctuate is a verb that describes movement, sometimes irregular, but often rising and falling in a wave-like pattern. The tides fluctuate according to the weather and season, for example. Your emotions fluctuate depending on what happens throughout the day, and so does your weight. In fact, you usually weigh less in the morning, before you've eaten. You're also taller, since your spine compresses as you walk around. So your height fluctuates, too.</li></ul>"
fluctuation,"<ul><li>The noun fluctuation refers to the deviations along the path from one point to another. We see frequent fluctuations in the stock market, as prices go up or down, and also in the weather, which is always changing.</li><li>The original form of the word fluctuation appeared as a mid-15th-century French word derived from the Latin fluctuationem, meaning ""vacillation."" The verb stem fluctuāre meant ""to undulate,"" referring to waves, giving rise to the idea of change and movement that is at the heart of the word. It might help to remember that fluctuation has the same root as the word fluent, and to think of it as something flowing, with frequent change along the way.</li></ul>"
focal,
focus,"<ul><li>Focus is something that camera lenses and sleepy students are always being asked to do. For cameras, it means finding a point where the subject is clear or ""in focus."" For students, it means paying attention.</li><li>Focus is all about finding a center — of a parabolic curve, of a lens, of a meditative state. In Latin, focus meant 'domestic hearth,' which just goes to show that not much has changed — since kitchens remain the focus of the modern home. Focus can be used as a verb, as in ""I need to focus on my work, so I can play video games later;"" and as a noun, as in ""What is the focus of this essay? I can't tell, since the writer seems to be all over the place.""</li></ul>"
follow,"<ul><li>Do you know when orange is the new black? When pleats are in style? Then you must follow fashion — you observe it closely. Follow can also mean you trail along behind someone. You might follow your brother to school.</li><li>If you follow something, such as line of argument, that means you understand it. If you follow through on something, such as a diet, that means you stick to it. Follow can also describe a sequence of events. Your election as class president might follow a scandal involving your opponent. Follow can also mean something is a logical consequence of something else. It follows that having read these examples you now understand the various meanings of follow. You follow me?</li></ul>"
for instance,
forage,"<ul><li>To forage is to wander around looking for food. When it’s cold and snowy outside, birds may forage for food in your backyard, digging around for whatever they can find.</li><li>The verb forage often describes animals searching for food, but it can also be applied to people. In those circumstances it retains the slightly desperate sense of coming up with whatever is available. For example, if you want to cook dinner but have no time to go to the grocery store, you might forage your refrigerator and cabinets to find good substitutes for ingredients in your recipe.</li></ul>"
forage,"<ul><li>To forage is to wander around looking for food.

In those circumstances it retains the slightly desperate sense of coming up with whatever is available. For example, if you want to cook dinner but have no time to go to the grocery store, you might forage your refrigerator and cabinets to find good substitutes for ingredients in your recipe.</li></ul>"
foremost,"<ul><li>Foremost is an adjective that means holding the highest position or rank. When naming advisors, presidents usually search for the foremost experts on various subjects.</li><li>If you are the foremost in your profession, you're the expert people will seek out for an opinion. If your foremost concern in a project is money, all other factors are secondary. You can also use this word as an adverb meaning ""before anything else."" The film, Gone With the Wind, is set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, but first and foremost, it is a love story.</li></ul>"
formidable,"<ul><li>People who are formidable inspire fear and respect thanks to their size, or special ability, or unusual  qualities. If you're a wildly popular celebrity, you probably don't go anywhere without a formidable bodyguard.</li><li>What's interesting about formidable is that we often tend to use it about things that are simultaneously scary and impressive. A formidable opponent is almost by definition a worthy one; a formidable challenge is almost by definition one worth rising to. Not surprisingly, this word is derived from the Latin formidare, ""to fear.""</li></ul>"
formulate,"<ul><li>To formulate is to come up with a plan. If you are locked out of your house, you'll need to formulate a plan to get back inside — preferably one that doesn't involve kicking in the door.</li><li>You can also use the verb formulate to mean ""put into words."" If too many people are showing up at your work in inappropriate clothes, your company may formulate a dress code policy. They may, for example, decree that shoes must be worn at all times. The verb can also mean ""to develop a formula for something."" If the dog ate the chicken you were going to use in your dinner, you may need to formulate a new recipe for chicken-less pot pie.</li></ul>"
foster,"<ul><li>To foster is to nurture something. A teacher could foster creativity by providing crayons to every student. You can also foster a child, which means the child lives in your home for a time.</li><li>You may have seen photos of a cat taking care of a baby rabbit, or a pig nursing a litter of puppies: those are little foster families. Foster can be a verb (to foster someone or something) or an adjective used to describe a foster family, child, or parent. The word is from the Old English fostrian meaning ""to supply with food, nourish, support,"" which sounds like what those mama hogs were doing. Unlike adopt, foster has a time limit.</li></ul>"
foul,"<ul><li>Foul is most commonly used as an adjective to describe a bad smell. As a verb, foul usually means “make dirty or messy.” You might foul your room to the point where it smells a bit foul.</li><li>In general, foul can be used as an adjective meaning ""bad."" Foul luck is bad luck; a foul day is a bad day. As a verb, foul can mean ""break the rules."" It’s used this way in sports, like when you commit a foul on the basketball court. The phrase ""foul play"" can be used in the context of sports or more generally, to indicate unfair or violent behavior. Avoid confusing foul with fowl, which refers to birds, especially chickens.</li></ul>"
fragment,"<ul><li>A fragment is a small piece that’s come off a larger whole, and to fragment is to break. If your teacher writes ""frag"" on your paper, you've got an incomplete sentence.</li><li>Fragment, meaning ""a tiny, brittle shard,"" first appeared as a noun and later as a verb. That afternoon you hacked away at the fireplace in your parents’ living room in search of secret treasure as a child? Those dusty chunks of brick you scattered all over their shag carpet were fragments of a once-intact wall, and a happier time before you were grounded. Not only did you cause physical damage that day, but you also fragmented their trust in you.</li></ul>"
fragmentation,"<ul><li>Fragmentation describes a separating of something into pieces. The way a family can be affected by divorce, its members living in separate houses, is one kind of fragmentation.</li><li>People often have an image of an exploding bomb when they think about fragmentation, and that sense of something breaking into tiny particles is a useful way to think of the word, no matter how it's used. A burst water balloon experiences fragmentation, and so does a city disrupted by violence. The Latin root word, fragmentum, literally means ""a piece broken off,"" or a fragment.</li></ul>"
fragmentize,
frankly,"<ul><li>To say something frankly is to be completely honest and straightforward. It's unusual when a politician answers reporters' questions frankly.</li><li>When someone's frank, they are plainspoken and truthful, and when you communicate frankly, your words have this quality. Telling people frankly that you need their help, or expressing criticism frankly but kindly can be difficult at times, but it's something to strive for. Frank and frankly have a Medieval Latin root, francus, ""free, or at liberty.""</li></ul>"
freestanding,"<ul><li>Freestanding things are unattached or separate from any other structure or support. A freestanding garage isn't connected to a house — it's a separate building.</li><li>Some houses, like row houses or townhouses, are connected to the house next door, sharing a common wall. Freestanding houses, on the other hand, are completely detached, with space between each. You can also use the adjective freestanding more figuratively, to describe something that isn't reliant or connected: ""It's a freestanding literary club — it's completely separate from and independent of the school.""</li></ul>"
friction,"<ul><li>When one thing rubs and grates against another, it causes friction. That can include two clashing personalities or simply a match striking the matchbox and causing a spark.</li><li>A form of resistance, friction is caused by a chafing movement between two or more objects. In the 18th century, friction meant specifically a “resistance to motion,” but a few decades later grew to also describe disagreement or conflict. The friction between the brakes and your tires helps stop your car when you're going too fast. Not speeding in the first place can help avoid friction between you and the traffic police.</li></ul>"
frigid,"<ul><li>Like the North Pole on the coldest day of winter, frigid is an adjective that means extremely chilly. It applies to both temperatures and personalities.</li><li>Frigid comes to us from the Latin frigidus, meaning “cold, chill, cool” or “indifferent.” That explains why it's used to describe both arctic weather and someone's particularly unfriendly demeanor. So the inside of your ice box is certainly frigid, but so is a stern boss who refuses to smile or say hi when you hop in the same elevator. His glare is so emotionally frosty that it freezes you in your tracks.</li></ul>"
function,"<ul><li>In the old ""Schoolhouse Rock"" song, ""Conjunction junction, what's your function?,"" the word function means, ""What does a conjunction do?"" The famous design dictum ""form follows function"" tells us that an object's design should reflect what it does.</li><li>Function is one of those words that gets used a lot and means lots of different things. It means what something does, but also what a person does, whether something or someone is doing what they should, and crazily enough, a big party. ""Your function is to bring the senator coffee at the political function. He cannot function without it.""</li></ul>"
fundamental,"<ul><li>When asked what the fundamental, or essential, principles of life are, a teenager might reply, ""Breathe. Be a good friend. Eat chocolate. Get gas money.""</li><li>Fundamental has its roots in the Latin word fundamentum, which means ""foundation."" So if something is fundamental, it is a key point or underlying issue — the foundation, if you will — that the thing is built upon.  Teachers argue that math fundamentals include memorizing the times tables and understanding long division. Many people would also argue that math fundamentals should include knowing how to use a calculator and knowing where the calculator's extra batteries are kept.</li></ul>"
fund,"<ul><li>A fund is a supply of money to be used for a specific purpose. You can start a fund for almost anything, such as your child’s education, a new car, or the establishment of the world’s largest origami collection.</li><li>Fund can be used as a verb meaning “provide funds for something.” If you’re unable to save up the money to start your origami collection, you might ask a friend to fund it. (We predict she’ll say no.) An organization that raises money for a particular, often charitable, purpose can also be called a fund. We doubt an origami collection warrants its own fund, but there's no harm in trying.</li></ul>"
furthermore,"<ul><li>Just when you think your friend has finished her long list of complaints, she begins a new sentence with, “Furthermore…” a word that signals she has even more to complain about.</li><li>Furthermore is a useful word when you have an additional point to make in an argument or explanation. It is often used at the beginning of a sentence and followed by a comma. You might tell your parents why you think you should go on a Hawaiian vacation and then add, “Furthermore, volcanic ash is excellent for the complexion.” For variety, you can also use words like moreover  or additionally in the same way.</li></ul>"
gap,"<ul><li>A gap is the space between two things. It can be physical (like ""the gap between your two front teeth"") or philosophical (like ""the generation gap"" between you and your parents).</li><li>Gap is a small word that packs a lot; it can be used in a straightforward manner: in England, the signs in the subway station say, ""Mind the gap"" — in hopes that passengers will not wander into the space between the train and the platform. The American retailer, ""The Gap,"" is said to have taken its name from the generation gap. The clothes were designed for teenagers and young adults, and therefore nothing your middle-aged parents would be caught dead in. Times change.</li></ul>"
gear,"<ul><li>The noun gear refers to several things. First, it’s the equipment we need for a sport or event. A gear is also a wheel with teeth that interlocks with another gear to transmit motion in a machine.</li><li>The background of gear as ""equipment"" dates back to around 1200 and comes from the Old Norse gervi, ""apparel."" The word gear in machinery became common in the early 19th century, although there is evidence that the word came to mean ""toothed wheel"" as early as 1520. Gear entered English slang around 1951, meaning something stylish. This use was popularized in the 1960s, under the influence of British pop music.</li></ul>"
generate,"<ul><li>Generate means produce or create. A good stock pick might generate cash, and a good idea might generate the basis for an Oscar-winning film.</li><li>Generate and the closely related word generation both come from the Latin word genus, which means ""stock or race."" Its root, in turn, is the Proto-Indo-European gen-, ""to produce, give birth, or beget."" Let's say you have two siblings. In that case, your parents' marriage has generated three children. In a hydroelectric power plant, water generates power. And you can get a paper route or babysit if you're looking to generate a little income.</li></ul>"
genuine,"<ul><li>Genuine things are true or authentic. When you're talking about people, being genuine has to do with being sincere.</li><li>This word has to do with things and people that are true. A genuine blonde is a real blonde — no hair dye involved. A genuine friend is a real friend you can trust when the chips are down. Genuine feelings are real feelings — not fake feelings put on as a show. A genuine hundred dollar bill is the real McCoy, not a counterfeit bill. When something is the real thing, it's genuine.</li></ul>"
genuinely,"<ul><li>The adverb genuinely describes something done in a way that's real and true. If your friend is genuinely thrilled about your plan to backpack across China next summer, she means it.</li><li>When you say something genuinely, you're honest. If you're genuinely worried about your friend getting hurt on her motorcycle, you'll beg her to wear a helmet. One theory about the origin of genuinely is that it comes from the Latin word for ""knee,"" genu, referencing a custom of a father acknowledging his paternity by holding his baby on his knee.</li></ul>"
gesture,"<ul><li>The thing to remember about gesture, whether you're using it as a verb or a noun, is that not only is it a movement of the hands or body, but it's also a movement that has some meaning, intention, or emotion behind it.</li><li>When you use gesture, you are entering into a whole history of human communication, because there is no language that exists entirely without gesture (a fun fact to bring up at parties). People can't communicate without gesture. It's so connected to intention that there is a phrase ""empty gesture,"" used to mean an action or movement that is without genuine feeling.</li></ul>"
get accustomed to,
giant,"<ul><li>A giant is someone that's unusually enormous. You can also use the word giant to describe something or someone that is really big. That giant green guy over there? That's the jolly green giant. Ho ho ho.</li><li>A star basketball player might be described as a giant, or a stunningly tall redwood tree, or even a very large business. These giants come from the giants of mythology, huge creatures that are featured in fairy and folk tales and inspired by the giants of Greek myth, who were a separate race of strong, aggressive gods. The Greek root is Gigas, with the plural form Gigantes.</li></ul>"
give rise to,
given,"<ul><li>A given is some detail or fact that is known to be true. Your mother might say, ""It's a given that I'll always love you, no matter how annoying you are.""</li><li>Something's a given if it's an established situation that you're sure of. It's a given that a first class airplane ticket will cost a lot more than a seat in coach, and it's also a given that the earth orbits the sun. It can also be an adjective: ""After considering the given facts, mark an answer on the multiple-choice test."" Given comes from the verb give, which has an Old English root of giefan, ""to bestow, allot, or commit.""</li></ul>"
govern,"<ul><li>To govern is to rule, lead, oversee, or otherwise control. Each U.S. state has its own governor, whose job it is to govern the affairs of that state.</li><li>While it's true that governors govern — that is, they head the executive branch of their state government — there are lots of other ways to use the verb govern. Almost anything that controls or has a lot of influence over something else can be said to govern. The rules of tennis, for example, govern the way that game is played. In mechanics, a device that controls other devices is called a governor. My dog's basic needs govern the way my household is run: his schedule is our schedule.</li></ul>"
grasp,"<ul><li>To grasp is to get a hold of something, literally or figuratively. Grasp the grammar textbook with both hands and then read it to grasp the rules of the English language.</li><li>It makes sense that the word grasp means understanding a concept since you are ""getting a hold of an idea"" just as you would grasp something tangible to hold. Grasp is good for when you're talking about comprehending the scale of something, or the full picture of a multi-faceted problem or idea. You might know that there is going to be a heat wave, but you may not grasp the idea of its relationship to global warming.</li></ul>"
groom,"<ul><li>To groom means to take care of the appearance, whether it's plucking eyebrows or combing hair. When you spend over an hour grooming in the bathroom, combing your mustache and buffing your nails, you drive everyone else who needs to use the bathroom crazy.</li><li>You can groom something besides a person. Resorts groom their golf courses and ski runs. If you own a horse, you groom it every day. Animals groom each other by picking off insects and licking at fur. You can also use groom in regards to the mind. If you are being groomed for a certain spot or position, you are being prepared to take over its activities and responsibilities. Let's hope that you will someday be groomed for a spot on an executive board. And last but not least, the man getting married at a wedding is the groom.</li></ul>"
groundless,"<ul><li>Something that's groundless isn't valid or justified, like your groundless fear that you failed your math quiz, even though you studied and knew all the material.</li><li>Grounds are ""factors forming the justification for a belief,"" and when you don't have any such grounds, your belief is groundless. In other words, anything groundless has no reason or cause to back it up. A groundless claim is one that has no proof, and a groundless suspicion is empty: ""We questioned that nice lady next door and made her cry, thanks to your groundless accusation that she stole our cat.""</li></ul>"
grounds,
groundwork,
grudging,"<ul><li>If you do something in a grudging manner (or grudgingly), you do it with reluctance. Doing homework, paying taxes, and saying sorry are all commonly done in a grudging manner.</li><li>""Grudging apology"" and ""grudging acceptance"" are probably the two most common uses of this word, which perhaps says something about our lack of grace as a species. The word derives from the medieval French word groucher, meaning ""to murmur or mumble."" A related word is grudge, meaning a long-lasting sense of ill will dating to a previous incident.</li></ul>"
guarantee,"<ul><li>To guarantee is to promise or to a make binding agreement. If a baseball player guarantees his team will win the World Series, he better not lead the league in strikeouts.</li><li>Guarantee is a word that is both a noun and a verb: the noun means ""a binding agreement"" and the verb is the act of making that agreement. This word seems to have come from garante, the Spanish word for ""protect"" and it's related to the Old French word warrant, which means ""to authorize."" Today, we often come across guarantee in advertisements, and you might wonder how they might guarantee to make your social life better if your teeth are whiter!</li></ul>"
hairline,
hallmark,"<ul><li>A hallmark is a distinctive characteristic of something or someone. That can mean a literal symbol on the bottom of a piece of pottery, or just a rock star's signature hair style.</li><li>Though some products have real hallmarks on them, indicating their creator or origin, this word is usually used in a less literal way to describe a unique attribute, a special style, or typical feature. A basketball player could say that coming to practice early is a hallmark of her success. A business could say their success is a hallmark of their commitment to customers. And you could definitely say Elvis' hip swivel was a hallmark of his performances.</li></ul>"
halt,"<ul><li>Whether it's used as a noun or a verb, the word halt means stop. You can remember this by remembering that when you step on the brake to halt your car (verb), it comes to a halt (noun).</li><li>English draws on both Romance and Germanic languages, and halt is one that comes from the Old High German haltmachen, which means ""to hold."" The word suggests a stoppage in the midst of action, and a Chinese proverb states, “We are not so much concerned if you are slow as when you come to a halt.” Consider, also, that a less-used definition of the word is that of ""lame"" or disabled, which still ties in with the idea of stopping.</li></ul>"
hamper,"<ul><li>Anything that hampers slows progress or makes it difficult to do something. You might think that the presence of your parents hampers your ability to look cool.</li><li>The verb hamper is for those times when normal progress is slow but not shut down completely. Hamper often describes travel during bad weather, like icy conditions that could hamper holiday travel. Hamper means ""slow going."" You may have heard of noun form of hamper, a container for holding dirty laundry: If your hamper is full, the need to do laundry could hamper your plans of going out and having fun.</li></ul>"
handy,"<ul><li>Someone who's handy is skilled and clever, especially when it comes to making or fixing things. If you're handy in the kitchen, you're a good cook.</li><li>A carpenter tends to be handy with a saw or a hammer, and if you're good at sewing, you're handy with a needle and thread. Another meaning of handy is ""useful"" or ""convenient."" Your laptop is handy because you use it for all kinds of things, and your smartphone is handy because you always keep it in your pocket — it's right there when you need it.</li></ul>"
haphazard,"<ul><li>Anything haphazard is random, disorganized, slipshod, or hit-or-miss. A tent erected haphazardly might look more like a big nylon bag of dirty laundry than a place to sleep.</li><li>Ever heard the expression ""I'll hazard a guess?"" In it, the word hazard means ""chance,"" as in ""take a chance.""  Think of the hap in haphazard as short for ""happen."" Combine hap- and -hazard and you get something that happens (or appears to have happened) by chance. If you approach a math problem with haphazard reasoning, you're likely to get it wrong.</li></ul>"
harness,"<ul><li>A harness is a set of straps that are put on a horse so it can be hitched to a wagon or a carriage. The harness distributes the effort across larger sections of the horse's body.</li><li>Other animals and people can also wear harnesses. Your dog might have a harness for walking, with the leash attaching to the harness and not the collar, keeping the dog from choking itself when it pulls. People wear harnesses for safety, when climbing trees or bungee jumping, for example. As a verb, harness means to control or direct as if with a harness for a specific purpose, the way solar power harnesses the power of the sun.</li></ul>"
harsh,"<ul><li>Harsh means severe or strict, particularly when referring to punishment. It would be a harsh punishment if you got grounded for two weeks just for coming home a little late for dinner.</li><li>There are many shades of meaning for the word harsh depending on its context, but all imply that something is more unpleasant than it needs to be. Harsh lighting hurts your eyes. A harsh disciplinarian gives out punishments that are too severe. Whereas constructive criticism is usually helpful, a harsh critique will only make you upset. The harsh reality of the world today is that millions of people are starving while others have too much.</li></ul>"
hasten,"<ul><li>The verb hasten means to move at a high speed. If you hasten to your room, no one will know that you came in late.</li><li>Hasten comes from the word haste, which means ""excessive speed or urgency."" The words hurry and hasten are synonyms. Hasten can also mean ""to make happen quickly,"" like when you open a window in the kitchen when you are cooking to hasten the room's cooling down. Hasten also means ""to be quick,"" like when you hasten to tell everyone that the rumor going around about you isn't true.</li></ul>"
hasty,"<ul><li>Hasty means speedy and brash. If you try to make a hasty exit after breaking up with someone, you’ll seem like a jerk.</li><li>Hasty, meaning “speedy, quick,” first came onto the scene in the mid 14th century. Later, it found itself paired with pudding to form hasty pudding, a dessert that only takes a short amount of time to make. Note that hasty, unlike fast, has negative connotations. If someone accuses you of having completed an assignment in a hasty fashion, it means your work appears careless.</li></ul>"
haul,"<ul><li>To haul is to move or take something, usually big and heavy, and put it somewhere else. If you've ever moved to a new house, then you know that having to haul all your stuff there can really take the joy out of moving into a new place.</li><li>You'll want to reserve haul for situations in which carrying something takes a lot of effort and ain't a lot of fun. You don't haul a sack of feathers, for example. You haul a bag of boulders, or a box of books. Haul is usually a verb, but you can also use it as a noun, when you're talking about lot of something that you caught or won. We went digging for clams—look at our haul! After winning at blackjack, take your haul and hit the road. Don't risk losing it all on roulette.</li></ul>"
havoc,"<ul><li>Havoc is a noun that means devastation or total mayhem. Havoc often wreaked by hurricanes, angry mobs, plundering Vikings, and wild parties that get out of control.</li><li>If we trace havoc way back, we arrive at a crossroads. Some people believe that the word comes from the Old French havot, meaning “plundering, devastation,” while others argue that it was passed down to us from the Latin habere, meaning “to have, possess.” Either way you look at it, the meaning remains the same: widespread disorder or destruction.</li></ul>"
hazard,"<ul><li>If something is a hazard, it is a potential source of danger. Balloons are fun, but they're a hazard for little kids who might put them in their mouths.</li><li>If you play miniature golf, you have to watch for hazards on the course — obstacles like the sand trap beside the dinosaur or the water hazard just past the windmill. As a verb, hazard means to take a risk, especially for the chance of a good return. You might hazard your chances at the roulette table or hazard a guess — that is, risk making a guess when you aren't certain.</li></ul>"
heed,"<ul><li>Heed is an old word, meaning ""to listen to and follow."" It can also be used as a noun: ""Take heed of my instructions,"" said the wizard, ""for the magic potion will work only by the light of the full moon.""</li><li>The most common use of heed is with warnings, as in ""You'd better heed my advice, or you'll be in serious trouble!"" The word derives from Old English hēdan and is related to the Dutch hoeden and German hüten — from Germanic cultures where fairy tales with mysterious warnings and magical consequences abound.</li></ul>"
heighten,"<ul><li>When you heighten something, you increase it or make it more intense. If you want to heighten awareness about homelessness, you might write an article for your local newspaper.</li><li>Extreme weather can act to heighten people's concern about climate change, and publicity for a good cause can heighten awareness of the ways college students can volunteer their time. A movie director might heighten the tension in a scene by using scary music and dramatic lighting. In all of these cases, something is intensified or increased. The oldest, fifteenth-century meaning of heighten, however, was ""to exalt, honor, or raise to a high position.""</li></ul>"
heir,"<ul><li>If your grandfather leaves his candy factory to you in his will, it means you're the heir to the family candy business, and after your grandfather dies, you will inherit the factory.</li><li>When you're named in a will or are legally entitled to inherit something, you're an heir. You can be the heir to someone's money, business, or title; in a monarchy, the king or queen's oldest son is usually the heir to the throne. The word heir isn't pronounced like ""hair,"" but instead has a silent h and sounds like ""air.""</li></ul>"
hence,"<ul><li>Hence means ""for this reason,"" or ""therefore."" One Hollywood starlet is a huge fan of tiny dogs, hence the Pomeranian puppy peeking out of her purse.</li><li>Hence not only means ""therefore."" It can also mean forward from this time. Nine months hence, a baby that has just been conceived will enter the world kicking and screaming. These days, you're more likely to hear the word hence in a movie set a hundred years ago than in casual conversation because it has a very old-fashioned ring to it.</li></ul>"
heritage,"<ul><li>Heritage can refer to practices or characteristics that are passed down through the years, from one generation to the next. Researching your family tree would help you gain a sense of your personal heritage.</li><li>Heritage is often used to discuss a cultural aspect or tradition that has been passed down through generations. For example, one might speak of an area’s ""rich musical heritage.” Heritage can also refer to a person's ethnic or cultural background. In a legal sense, heritage is property that you inherit, like a silver teapot your great aunt Sally left to you.</li></ul>"
heterogeneous,"<ul><li>Heterogeneous can be used to describe the diversity of nearly anything — populations, classrooms, collections. A heterogeneous array of immigrants passed through Ellis Island to help create the American ""melting pot.""</li><li>An easy way to remember the meaning of this word is that homo is the same and hetero is different. So, a homogeneous group of puppies might consist of apricot-colored poodles, while a heterogeneous group might consist of a hodgepodge of different pups ranging from dachshunds to dalmatians. Anytime you are confronted with a group whose members are not all similar to one another, you have an opportunity to trot out heterogeneous.</li></ul>"
hide,"<ul><li>You can hide your feelings or you can hide your mom’s birthday present. You can even hide yourself if you need to avoid someone. Whatever it is, when you hide something, you put it out of sight.</li><li>Hide can mean that you keep something secret, like the way you really feel about your dad’s meatloaf. You can also hide something physical. If you spill juice on your white sofa, you can hide the stain with a pillow. Sometimes people hide also — that means the person stays out of sight. A bankrobber will hide from the police, or you might hide from your mom to avoid doing the dishes.</li></ul>"
hinder,"<ul><li>The verb hinder means to block or put something in the way of, so if you’re in a high-speed car chase with the police, they might put up a blockade to hinder your progress.</li><li>The word hinder came from the Old English hindrian, which means to  ""injure or damage."" That's a little more extreme than what it means today, because, now it just means to get in the way of something or someone. People might not like you too much if you make it a practice to hinder their progress or get in the way of things they want, even if it's a small hindrance like blocking someone from getting to the cookie jar.</li></ul>"
hint,"<ul><li>A hint is a slight indication or clue. Your mother might hint at the fact that she doesn’t like your shoes, while your grandmother will just come right out and say that they’re ugly.</li><li>If you’re a journalist following a lead, you’ll prefer that your source give you all the facts, rather than just a hint. A hint can be an indirect suggestion and it is also a very small amount — maybe you take just a hint of sugar in your coffee. As a verb, hint is an intimation or subtle suggestion. It’s also something you drop, like when you hint that you want a particular video game for your birthday.</li></ul>"
hire,"<ul><li>When you hire someone, you invite them to work for you or the company you represent. If you manage your local ice cream shop, it might be part of your job to hire extra ice cream scoopers for the busy summer season.</li><li>Your boss at the animal shelter might hire you immediately if she's desperate for help — or if you impress her as a true animal lover. Once she does, she can call you ""a new hire,"" or a recently hired employee. It's less common in the U.S. than in Britain, but you can also say you hire a car when you rent or lease one. Hire comes from the Old English hyr, which means both ""wages"" and ""interest.""</li></ul>"
hitherto,"<ul><li>Use the adverb hitherto when you're describing a state or circumstance that existed up until now. If you find a hitherto undiscovered hidden tunnel in your cellar, you're the first to discover it.</li><li>When some particular situation has existed so far, up until the moment that you're speaking of, you can use the word hitherto to talk about it. You could say that you're taking a hot air balloon ride that you were hitherto too scared to contemplate, or that a very shy girl in your philosophy class who was hitherto totally silent finally spoke up today and asked a very intelligent question.</li></ul>"
hobby,"<ul><li>A hobby is an activity that you do in your spare time for fun. Your hobby may be putting together model train sets and driving your mom crazy from all the noise.</li><li>In the 13th century the word hobby referred to a small horse or a pony. It later came to describe a toy horse — a hobbyhorse. It’s from the hobbyhorse that the word’s modern sense of “favorite pastime” evolved. A hobby is something that you do for fun — not money — and you typically do it fairly regularly. Collecting stamps, growing roses, reading — any of these can be hobbies.</li></ul>"
hold,"<ul><li>If you grasp something in your hands, you hold it. Be careful when you hold the puppy — he's so wriggly, and you wouldn't want to drop him!</li><li>Hold also means to keep from exhaling. If you forget to hold your breath when you go underwater, you're sure to come up sputtering. The noun hold means the cargo area on a ship or airplane. When you check your bag, it's stored in the hold of the plane during the flight. If you packed your book and your snacks in it, it might make more sense to hold onto it instead.</li></ul>"
hollow,"<ul><li>If something is hollow, it is empty on the inside. A chocolate Easter bunny looks like so much chocolate until you realize that it is hollow and quickly eaten.</li><li>The idea of emptiness is apparent in the other uses for hollow too. A valley between mountains is called a hollow and if you're really thin, you may have hollow cheeks. Things like words and promises are hollow if the person uttering them does not intend to keep them. And a hollow victory is not very satisfying, as it means that you have reached your goal, but lost something more important along the way.</li></ul>"
homogeneous,"<ul><li>If a group of things are homogeneous, they're all the same or similar, like a room full of identically dressed Elvis impersonators.</li><li>The adjective homogeneous comes from the Greek homogenes, meaning “of the same kind.” You can break down the root of the word further into two parts: homos, meaning “same,” and genos, meaning “kind, gender, race, stock.” It sounds very scientific, but if you look around the table at home and everyone is eating a bowl of oatmeal, you could safely describe your family’s breakfast tastes as homogeneous.</li></ul>"
host of,
however,"<ul><li>However means ""even so"" or, ""on the other hand,"" and you use it to introduce a complication or contradiction. You might tell your friend, ""I love your cooking. However, I already have plans for dinner tonight.""</li><li>The adverb however has a few different meanings. It often shows contrast. You might be training to become a lawyer, however your secret dream is to dance. However also means ""in whatever way."" You might say to your father, ""However you have to do it, convince Mom to buy me that car!"" It also means ""to whatever degree."" However certain you are in your gut that Mr. Plum is the murderer, you need to wait for evidence before accusing him.</li></ul>"
hub,"<ul><li>A hub is the center of a wheel or the center of some kind of activity. If all of an airline's flights go through Atlanta, you'd say the southern city is their hub.</li><li>You know how a lot of activity is called a hubbub? That makes sense when you consider that a hub, in a wheel or otherwise, is the center of whatever's going on. Southern California has long been a hub of the computer industry, and Detroit used to be the hub of the auto industry. Busy airports like the ones in Chicago and Atlanta are called hubs. Any hub is important, because it's right in the middle of all the action.</li></ul>"
huge,"<ul><li>Use the adjective huge to describe something that’s really, really big. When your friend throws a huge birthday party and invites everyone she knows, you can finally talk to that cute neighbor you have a huge crush on.</li><li>Huge is a relative word — there’s no specific degree or size something has to reach before you can say it’s huge. You can eat a huge piece of cake, or go see huge elephants in the zoo. Cake and elephants are both concrete things, but huge can also describe things that aren’t actual objects. For example, you can make a huge difference by volunteering at an animal shelter.</li></ul>"
hurdle,"<ul><li>A hurdle is a barrier or other obstacle that a runner has to jump over during a race. If you trip on a hurdle, you probably won't win the race.</li><li>When they're doing certain types of races, both human and horse athletes have to leap across hurdles (sometimes other animals do this too, like dogs and even rabbits). To do this is also to hurdle. There are physical hurdles, and then there are their figurative counterparts — those difficulties or hurdles that prevent you from progressing in your life.</li></ul>"
hypothetical,"<ul><li>Everyone who has ever taken a science class knows the word ""hypothesis,"" which means an idea, or a guess, that you are going to test through an experiment. A hypothetical is related to that. It means something based on an informed guess.</li><li>Hypotheticals are fun. How would you do in a hypothetical arm-wrestling competition against your Grandma? There are people in the Pentagon whose jobs are to consider all kinds of hypotheticals––what if Luxembourg armed itself with nuclear weapons? What if France developed the ability to pelt Switzerland with cannons firing cheeses?</li></ul>"
ice sheet,
identical,"<ul><li>When you're looking for exact replicas, don't waste your time on
snowflakes or fingerprints; no two are identical, or exactly
the same.</li><li>Great mind may think alike, but they'll never be identical. Twins, on the other hand, very well may be — if they've come from the same split embryo that is. It makes sense then, that the word identical has linguistic roots in the Latin word idem, meaning ""the same.""</li></ul>"
idiosyncrasy,"<ul><li>If a person has an idiosyncrasy, he or she has a little quirk, or a funny behavior, that makes him or her different. If you only say goodbye in French, never in English, that would be an idiosyncrasy.</li><li>Idio seems like it means stupid, but really it is Latin for ""one's own,"" as an idiosyncrasy is one's own particular, usually odd, behavior. Putting salt in your hot chocolate or needing the light on to sleep or tapping your head while you think are all idiosyncrasies. A machine such as a DVD player has an idiosyncrasy if you have to do something weird to it to make it work like having to bang it on the back left-hand side to stop it from skipping.</li></ul>"
ignite,"<ul><li>Ignite is a verb that means to start heat or a flame. Trying to ignite a match inside a dark fireworks factory is a really bad idea — one that can get you blown sky high.</li><li>The literal definition of ignite is to cause something to catch fire or burn. Dousing a house in gasoline and putting a lit match to the front door will surely cause the home to ignite. In its more figurative sense, ignite means to inspire intense feelings. A passionate kiss can ignite a fiery romance and a controversial speech can ignite fierce anger.</li></ul>"
illuminate,"<ul><li>To illuminate is to light up — with physical light or with an idea. A spotlight might illuminate an actor on stage, and a good chemistry teacher might illuminate students with a lesson on the atomic structure of hydrogen.</li><li>Originally, the verb illuminate referred to decorating handwritten manuscripts with bright lettering or pictures. Monks illuminated manuscripts with colors like gold, silver, bright red, and blue. Nowadays you can illuminate anything in the dark — either literally or figuratively. If you are afraid of the dark, illuminate your bedroom. In the dark when it comes to organic chemistry? Get an illuminating tutor.</li></ul>"
illusion,"<ul><li>An illusion is something that isn't real. It may look real, but it's actually fake — just a crafty construction or fantasy. Like the old rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick practiced by magicians around the globe.</li><li>An illusion is an act of deception. Some optical illusions are pretty cool to watch, but an illusion can also point to an erroneous belief or false perception of reality, which is where you start getting into hallucination territory — seeing things that aren't there. You can give the illusion that you’re fascinated by your professor’s lecture by chewing on your pencil, furrowing your brow, and making sure to nod enthusiastically every so often.</li></ul>"
imitate,"<ul><li>When you imitate someone, you copy them. Youth marketers capitalize on kids' desire to imitate––tweens imitate teens, teens imitate young adults, and marketers supply the product lines to make it easy.</li><li>Humans learn by imitating others. Babies carefully watch their caregivers' lips, learning to imitate the movements they make to create language sounds. Writers often begin their careers imitating the style of older writers they admire.</li></ul>"
immediately,"<ul><li>If you want it NOW, you want it immediately. Immediately means this minute, this moment, right away!</li><li>Immediately is an adverb that usually applies to time, but can also mean next to, or nearby, as in, ""The kids immediately to your right has red hair."" It can also be used to talk about close, even direct, connections, as in, ""Are you immediately involved in the push to get rid of the schools superintendent?"" Despite the different uses, the meaning is similar. When you see immediately, think close, sudden, and now!</li></ul>"
immense,"<ul><li>Immense means very large in size, amount, or degree. You might describe the ocean as immense, or your homework load, or the slice of cake your brother took, leaving you a tiny sliver.</li><li>This word has an immense number of near synonyms: huge, great, enormous, vast, gigantic, colossal, mammoth, copious, tremendous are a few of the more common ones. If you're having immense difficulty deciding which word to use, just plain ""very big"" might do.</li></ul>"
immensely,"<ul><li>Immensely is an adverb that means vastly, or very, or hugely. An immensely good time is a really, really good time.</li><li>If you know that immense means huge, then you probably already have a sense of what immensely means. It's a word for describing the enormous degree of something. A New York Times bestseller is an immensely popular book. Any offensive lineman is an immensely large human being. The earth is immensely old. A mouse can't be described as doing anything immensely, but an elephant does things immensely all the time.</li></ul>"
immigration,"<ul><li>Immigration is the process of moving to a new country to stay. New York's Ellis Island was considered a gateway for European immigration to the United States during the early 1900's. Nowadays, people immigrate through airports instead of islands.</li><li>The word migration is in immigration, which is something we think of birds doing when they fly South for the winter. It's not an accident — if American birds had little passports, they'd have to go through immigration when they got to Mexico. When humans immigrate, they have to follow the rules of the new country or else they risk getting in trouble. Immigration is the act of going to a new country, while emigration refers to the process of leaving one.</li></ul>"
immobile,"<ul><li>Something immobile can't move or be moved — it's locked or stuck in place.</li><li>If you know that mobile things move around, then you're halfway to understanding what immobile means: this refers to anything that can't move. A mountain is immobile; no one's moving that. Sometimes people who are very large — like offensive lineman — are described as immobile, because they are big and hard to move. When something is immobile, it's not going anywhere.</li></ul>"
immobility,"<ul><li>Immobility is the state of not being able to move around. If you fall out of a tree and break your arms and legs, then you will have to put up with months of immobility while your bones heal.</li><li>Immobility could mean the condition of not being able to move, like that poor mouse stuck in a glue trap whose immobility will lead to its starvation. Immobility can also just mean the state of not moving. If you are entranced by a beautiful sunset, you might stand with quiet immobility while watching the sky.</li></ul>"
immoral,"<ul><li>Use the adjective immoral to describe a person, group, or situation that intentionally goes against accepted ideas of what is right, like a government that attacks its own people, or a friend who steals your favorite spatula.</li><li>Morals are the principles we follow that help us know the difference between right and wrong. When someone is immoral, they make decisions that purposely violate a moral agreement. Immoral is sometimes confused with amoral, which describes someone who has no morals and doesn’t know what right or wrong means. Someone immoral, though, knows the difference and does bad stuff anyway, like that so-called friend who takes your utensils.</li></ul>"
impermeable,"<ul><li>If you have a waterproof raincoat, you could say that your coat is impermeable to the rain. Something that is impermeable does not allow water or liquid to pass through it.</li><li>Made up of the prefix im-, meaning “not,” and the adjective permeable, meaning “allowing to pass through,” impermeable is used in much the same way as impervious or impenetrable. However, more so than these words, impermeable is especially associated with liquids and is often used in a scientific or technical context. Some gadgets, like waterproof watches and underwater cameras, are designed to be impermeable.</li></ul>"
impetus,"<ul><li>An impetus is the force behind something, whether it's a boulder rolling down a hill or a person making a decision.</li><li>Very little would get done if there were no such thing as an impetus: an impetus is some kind of force that gets something or somebody moving. If you push a car that's out of gas, you're the impetus that's getting it moving. An impetus doesn't have to be physical. Advertisers hope their commercials will be an impetus to buy the product.</li></ul>"
implausible,"<ul><li>Something that's implausible is farfetched or unlikely. If it's 3 pm and you still have to study for three exams and write an essay before midnight, it’s implausible that you’ll also have time to watch a movie.</li><li>The adjective implausible breaks down into im, meaning “not,” and plausible, meaning ""likely."" So it simply means ""not likely."" Implausible ideas or stories usually get high marks for creativity, but they're just too crazy to be believable. But as philosopher René Descartes noted, “One cannot conceive anything so strange and so implausible that it has not already been said by one philosopher or another.”</li></ul>"
implement,"<ul><li>Apply the noun implement when you want to use a fancy word for ""tool."" A knife and fork are implements for handling food.</li><li>The noun implement is a very useful word for just about anything you want to describe as a tool or a thing that helps you do something. An implement can be as simple as chimpanzees using a stick to eat ants with or a bulldozer that moves huge amounts of earth in building. The word relates to something that ""fills up"" a house, as in all sorts of things that allow a house to work properly.</li></ul>"

The word relates to something that ""fills up"" a house, as in all sorts of things that allow a house to work properly.</li></ul>"
imply,"<ul><li>Imply means to express, suggest, or show something without stating it directly: A friend’s gruff manner would imply that she’s in a foul mood.</li><li>The verb imply comes from a Latin word meaning “enfold or entangle” but has come to mean “to hint at.” You might imply something that you don’t want to outright say if you’re feeling coy. If you don’t call someone back after she leaves eight messages, you imply that you don’t want to chat. When you make a subtle suggestion, you imply.</li></ul>"
imposing,"<ul><li>Imposing is an adjective reserved for those things that are impressive in the sense that they are large or serious, as in the US Capitol Building or even, say, a professional wrestler.</li><li>When you look at the word imposing you see the word pose, which is useful in remembering what it means. A person who is imposing might strike a pose because they feel they have a lot to show. In fact, imposing is derived from the French verb imposer, which means ""to inflict."" Its French roots may inspire you to envision the enormous and expensive wigs worn by members of the French court. The larger the wig, the more imposing it was. And all the more reason to strike a pose!</li></ul>"
imprecise,"<ul><li>If you’re being imprecise, you’re not being exact. If you try to draw a perfect circle with your eyes closed, your drawing will probably be imprecise.</li><li>One field where imprecise measurements can turn out to be troublesome is cooking. If you add an imprecise amount of flour into pizza dough, you will either get a crumbly, floury mess that won't stick together, or a big, gooey glob of dough that you can't roll out into a flat crust. Either way, your pizza will not turn out very well, and you might want to remeasure or order from the local pizza place!</li></ul>"
improbable,"<ul><li>Your parents might tell you it's improbable that they'll buy you a car when you turn 16. Since improbable means something is unlikely but not impossible, your optimism allows you to keep hoping.</li><li>The adjective improbable also means statistically unlikely to happen. You might be afraid to fly, but the odds of a plane crash are so low that such an event is improbable. Improbable also means something that is so outrageous that you'd never admit you believed in it. You know the existence of the Loch Ness Monster is improbable, but that doesn't stop you from looking for it when you travel to Scotland.</li></ul>"
in fact,
in great demand,
in respect to,
tandem,"<ul><li>Tandem describes an arrangement where people or animals are in formation, one behind the other. Couples attached at the hip sometimes like to ride tandem bicycles, which allow two people to pedal the same bike. How cute.</li><li>In 1785, tandem first came into existence as a noun meaning “carriage pulled by horses harnessed one behind the other.” About a hundred years later, people started to use tandem to refer to bicycles with two seats. This type of bicycle has two sets of pedals and two seats, but only one set of wheels. To transform tandem into an adverb, just stick in in front of it. ""In tandem"" can just mean ""together"" — like two departments working in tandem on a project.</li></ul>"
in the long run,"<ul><li>In the long run means ""eventually."" If you think your job will be good experience in the long run, you believe that after a long time passes, you'll be glad you had it.</li><li>When someone uses the phrase in the long run, she's imagining a very long period of time going by. If your new windows will save you money in the long run, it means that although they cost a lot right now, you'll spend less heating your house over the years and will eventually save money. When you look into the future, especially if you're making a decision, you're imagining what will happen in the long run.</li></ul>"
inaccessible,"<ul><li>Can't get to something you want? It must be inaccessible. If it were accessible, you wouldn't have any trouble finding it.</li><li>This word makes a lot of sense when you think about the word access, which is the ability to get at, use, or have something. Inaccessible things are out of reach. There are a lot of ways this word is used. A building without a ramp is often called inaccessible because people who use wheelchairs can't get in. People can be inaccessible too. If your doctor has office hours only one hour a day every two months, she's really inaccessible.</li></ul>"
inadvertently,"<ul><li>Inadvertently is an adverb that means ""without knowledge or intent,"" like when you inadvertently take someone else's coat from the coatroom because it looks just like yours.</li><li>When you do something inadvertently, you don't mean to do it — you might inadvertently step in a puddle, leave something important at home, or hurt your friend's feelings. Some things that happen inadvertently aren't mistakes, though: They happen by chance. For example,  if you just happen to park your car at the exact place that blocks a bus from hitting a pedestrian, you've inadvertently saved a life.</li></ul>"
inaugurate,"<ul><li>To inaugurate means to start something, to give it a kick off. The opening day pep rally inaugurates the high school football season.</li><li>Inaugurate comes from the Latin word augur, which means taking signs from birds, or telling the future. The Romans would always look for good omens to mark the beginning of something — a war, or a new emperor’s reign — so inaugurate became linked to new beginnings. While inaugurate has long been used in formal contexts, such as the swearing-in ceremony that inaugurates a President's term in office, the word is now also used casually. You might inaugurate your marathon training with a long run.</li></ul>"
inauspicious,"<ul><li>Reaching into your hat to pull out a rabbit and instead removing a sock can seem like an inauspicious start to your magic show. Inauspicious describes something that seems unpromising or unlikely to be successful.</li><li>If it's unlucky, badly timed, or it seems to point to an unhappy outcome, it's inauspicious. A dark, stormy sky on the day of a wedding can be seen as inauspicious, and so can an awkward job interview. The opposite of inauspicious is auspicious, which means lucky or promising. Both words come from the Latin auspicium, which has to do with predicting the future by observing the flight of birds.</li></ul>"
incentive,"<ul><li>If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she might offer to treat you to ice cream after as an incentive. An incentive is something that stimulates you to take action or work harder.</li><li>This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum, from incentivus, ""stimulating."" In Latin, incentivus meant ""setting the tune,"" from incinere, ""to sing."" The related English verb is incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early 1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon.</li></ul>"
inception,"<ul><li>The inception is the beginning. Since its inception, Wikipedia has been created by its users.</li><li>Inception sounds like conception, but their meanings are distinct.  Conception usually refers to the moment of becoming pregnant. Inception refers more to the beginning, to entering upon an undertaking. Inception implies the start of a specific thing like a campaign or a company. Subsequent events take place after the inception. At the moment of conception, most women are at the inception of motherhood.</li></ul>"
incidentally,"<ul><li>Incidentally is a word you use when you've got more to say on a topic or want to transition into a new subject. Think of the word incidentally as a more formal way to say ""by the way.""</li><li>Incidentally can also mean ""by chance"" if you want to remark on a coincidence. Sometimes, things just happen by chance, like you and your friend showing up at the same place incidentally. Incidentally, the word ends in lly so don't forget to throw that extra l in there!</li></ul>"
inclement,"<ul><li>Inclement usually refers to severe or harsh weather that is cold and wet. When packing for a trip to the Caribbean bring tank tops and shorts, but don't forget a raincoat in case of inclement weather.</li><li>This adjective can also refer to a person or action that is harsh and unmerciful. Inclement is from a Latin root formed from the prefix in- ""not"" plus clemens ""clement."" This English adjective clement can mean either mild or merciful; the more commonly used noun clemency can mean mildness or mercy.</li></ul>"
inconceivable,"<ul><li>If something is inconceivable, it doesn’t seem possible, it’s hard to imagine, or it can’t be true. It might seem inconceivable that a society would choose to pay bankers more than teachers, but it’s true.</li><li>When an idea or event is inconceivable, it's so outlandish, amazing, or horrible that it’s hard to believe. The horrible acts committed by the Nazis during the Holocaust are inconceivable on many levels, yet we know they occurred. Some things are inconceivable because they really wouldn't happen — for example, it's inconceivable that you would actually eat your hat.</li></ul>"
inconclusive,"<ul><li>If something's inconclusive, that means it doesn't lead to a conclusion or a resolution. Inconclusive often describes scientific results. If your data about a flu outbreak is inconclusive, then your results don't prove anything.</li><li>A good way to remember the meaning of inconclusive is to look at the root word conclusive, which means ""definitive, decisive, and convincing."" When you add in- — which means ""not"" — to the front of conclusive, you get a word that means ""not definitive.""  When something's inconclusive, it doesn't resolve your questions and leaves room for debate. If you're a detective, the last thing you want to hear is that your evidence is inconclusive.</li></ul>"
incorporate,"<ul><li>To incorporate is to include or integrate a part into the whole. Incorporate is a more active version of the word ""include""; if you incorporate, you are adding something to the mix.</li><li>In the business world, to incorporate is a legal process. In other usages, the word incorporate really just means to include something or work something into whatever was already existing. You could incorporate your new roommate's furniture into the decor of your apartment, but you may not find a way to incorporate her cat's litter box.</li></ul>"
incursion,"<ul><li>When an army crosses a border into another country for battle, they are making an incursion into enemy territory. An incursion is an invasion as well as an attack.</li><li>Incursion can also be used to describe other things that rush in like an army such as an invasive species into a new region or floodwaters entering your home. When an airplane heads onto a runway it is not supposed to land on, risking airport safety, it is known as a runway incursion. And an incursion of cold air could make September feel like December.</li></ul>"
indicate,"<ul><li>To indicate means to point something out or to present evidence. If you feel sick during a car trip, you can indicate this to the driver by groaning loudly or announcing ""I'm going to be sick!""</li><li>Scientists rely on data from experiments to indicate whether their theories are correct. Indicate can also describe a symptom or signal of something else. For example, a stock market recovery could indicate growing public confidence — or foolishness, depending on which expert you ask. The verb indicate comes from the noun indication, which in turn comes from the Latin word indicare, meaning ""something that points out or shows.""</li></ul>"
indication,"<ul><li>An indication is a sign––it indicates, or suggests, some conclusion. The way you blush furiously when a certain someone talks to you is an indication that you have a crush on them.</li><li>An indication is like a clue, or a suggestion, but it's not proof. If someone is weaving all over the place when they walk, that could be an indication that they’re drunk. But then again, it could indicate an inner-ear infection that has ruined their balance. The verb, indicate, literally means to point out, by using your index finger. But indications don’t require actual fingers pointing to a cause.</li></ul>"
indigenous,"<ul><li>Use indigenous to describe a plant, animal or person that is native or original to an area. Though Switzerland is known for its chocolates, chocolate, which comes from the cocoa plant, is indigenous to South America.</li><li>Indigenous, aboriginal, and native all mean the same thing. Aboriginal, however, is commonly used in connection with Australia, and native with North America. The most neutral of the three terms, indigenous comes from the Latin word, indigena meaning ""a native."" An indigenous ceremony or religion is one traditionally used by a certain group of people.</li></ul>"
indiscriminately,"<ul><li>Indiscriminately means in a random or careless way. If your teacher graded indiscriminately, she'd assign As and Ds haphazardly, without even considering her students' work.</li><li>This adverb is great for describing action that's taken in a completely unsystematic way. One child puts away his toys carefully, sorting blocks into one basket and stuffed animals into another. His sister, on the other hand, indiscriminately tosses all her toys into one large box. When you discriminate, you recognize the difference between things; act indiscriminately, and you pay no attention to these distinctions. An alternate meaning is ""without judgment.""</li></ul>"
indispensable,"<ul><li>Indispensable is a strong adjective for something that you couldn't do without. If you have asthma and you're packing for summer vacation, your inhaler is indispensable, unless you enjoy gasping on the beach.</li><li>Something that is dispensable is something you could get rid of, like that box of yogurt-covered zucchini snacks that's been in the pantry for a year. So if something is indispensable you couldn't possibly go without it, like salt, or for some people, coffee. Chocolate is indispensable for chocolate chip cookies, as is furniture for the adult hide-and-go-seek league.</li></ul>"
indistinct,"<ul><li>Is it hard to tell what someone is saying? Can you not see something clearly? Anything hard to make out is indistinct.</li><li>Indistinct things are fuzzy, unclear, and hard to see or understand. A whisper can be indistinct. A clear, confident speaker is not indistinct. People like to say what a cloud is shaped like, but clouds are generally pretty indistinct — that's why different people will see different shapes in the same cloud. When we're writing, speaking, or drawing, we should try to be distinct, not indistinct — because we want to be understood.</li></ul>"
induce,"<ul><li>To induce is to move or lead someone to action. A promise of a lollipop can induce a toddler to do just about anything, even sit down and be polite to Aunt Edna. Older kids need something more substantial.</li><li>Some people believe that if you offer someone a large enough sum of money, you could induce them to do almost anything. But a movie heroine might say to the villain, ""Nothing could induce me to marry you. Not all the money in the world. Not if you were the last man on Earth!"" Induce also means to stimulate the occurrence of something, such as medications used to induce vomiting, or to induce a pregnant woman to go into labor.</li></ul>"
inducement,"<ul><li>The act of persuading someone to do something is called inducement. If you're training a dog, you might use food as an inducement to make the dog do what you want.  This works with some humans too.</li><li>The original meaning of the noun inducement came from the Latin verb inducere, meaning ""to lead or persuade.""  Roman philosopher Seneca said, “There is no evil that does not promise inducements. Avarice promises money; luxury, a varied assortment of pleasures; ambition, a purple robe and applause. Vices tempt you by the rewards they offer.”  So you can be seduced to bad behavior by some inducements or encouraged to good behavior by others.  Would you like a treat?</li></ul>"
ineffectively,
inert,"<ul><li>Something that's unable to move or moving without much energy can be described as inert. Wind up in a body cast and you’ll find yourself not only itchy, but totally inert.</li><li>When motion is restricted or sluggish, or when something or someone appears lifeless, the adjective to use is inert. A dog who's playing dead is inert, as is a really boring movie. Or for those of you paying attention in chemistry class, you may have heard of inert gases — those elements that won't react with other elements or form chemical compounds.</li></ul>"
inevitable,"<ul><li>If something is inevitable, it will definitely happen, like death or tax season.</li><li>Inevitable comes from the Latin word inevitabilis, which means unavoidable.  If you say something is inevitable, you give the sense that no matter what scheme you come up with to get around it, it's going to happen sooner or later. You can use all the skin products you want, but wrinkles are inevitable.</li></ul>"
inference,"<ul><li>An inference is an idea or conclusion that's drawn from evidence and reasoning. An inference is an educated guess.</li><li>We learn about some things by experiencing them first-hand, but we gain other knowledge by inference — the process of inferring things based on what is already known. When you make an inference, you're reading between the lines or just looking carefully at the facts and coming to conclusions. You can also make faulty inferences. If you hear a person's weight is 250 pounds, you might make the inference that they're overweight. But what if they're seven feet tall?</li></ul>"
infirm,"<ul><li>To be infirm is to be physically weak. If your great grandmother can't get around without a walker or a wheelchair, you might describe her as infirm.</li><li>The adjective infirm is most often used to talk about elderly people whose bodies don't work as well as they used to — there's an implication of old age in the word. You could also describe an infirm person as decrepit or feeble. Sometimes a person's morals or character are described as infirm, which means you can't count on them to do the right thing. The Latin root, infirmus means ""weak or feeble,"" or alternately, ""superstitious or inconstant.""</li></ul>"
inflate,"<ul><li>Using your own breath or an air pump, you can inflate a balloon — or anything else you need to pump air into. When you inflate something you fill it with air (or any other gas) to make it expand.</li><li>From the Latin verb inflāre, ""to blow into,"" the word inflate appeared in English in the early 16th century. Although we usually think of the word inflate as referring to blowing air or gas into a balloon or a tire, anything that grows larger, from food prices to an egoist's self-image, can be inflated. When an item becomes scarce, its price is likely to be inflated.</li></ul>"
inflict,"<ul><li>When you force an undesirable or harmful event on someone, you inflict it on them. You might prefer that someone inflict some physical pain on you rather than inflict you with the boredom of another trip to the annual flower show.</li><li>The verb inflict comes from the Latin word inflictus, meaning “to strike or dash against.” If you cause anything bad to happen to a person, animal, or even an object, you inflict that badness on them. For example, someone can inflict injuries or suffering on other people or inflict damage on property. We can inflict pollution or over-development on our environment. It's always a negative thing — you wouldn't say you inflict happiness or love on others.</li></ul>"
infrastructure,"<ul><li>The infrastructure is the basic foundation or underlying framework of an organization or system. In your house, the infrastructure is the system of beams, weight-bearing walls and the foundation that keeps it standing.</li><li>Infrastructure often refers to the equipment and structures required by the military or by a country or region. Roads, bridges, and school buildings are part of our nation's infrastructure, and are necessary for the continued growth of our communities. This word was formed as a compound in English, using the prefix infra- ""below, underneath.""</li></ul>"
ingenious,"<ul><li>Something ingenious shows creativity and inventiveness. If someone compares you to Einstein, they're implying that you, too, are ingenious.</li><li>Ingenious comes from the Latin words for inborn talent. It started off meaning someone who was talented or incredibly smart, but has come to mean ""inventive"" or ""clever."" If you could calculate how long a given water supply would last during a drought in your head, people might call you a math genius. But if you can come up with a solution to solve all water shortage issues during a drought, you will be praised as ingenious. Ingenious can also describe an object, like an ingenious device.</li></ul>"
ingenuity,"<ul><li>Ingenuity is the ability to think creatively about a situation or to solve problems in a clever way. If you want to build a boat out of toothpicks and yarn, you’ll need a lot of ingenuity.</li><li>The Latin word for “mind, intellect” is a root of ingenuity, and it takes a bright and fast-thinking intellect to use ingenuity in a situation. Athletes show ingenuity all the time, finding exciting ways to outwit their opponents and to achieve victory. Master criminals rely on their ingenuity in order to evade the law when they are chased. Ingenuity is all about imagination, and an imaginative mind knows that every obstacle can be overcome with a little ingenuity.</li></ul>"
inherent,"<ul><li>Use the adjective inherent for qualities that are considered permanent or cannot be separated from an essential character.</li><li>We use the adjective inherent to describe attributes that are part of the essential nature of something. It's different from you being tall, rather than being a description, it has to be a quality and this quality is unchangeable. So, for example, if you have never been able to eat spinach, you have an inherent dislike of it.</li></ul>"
inherently,"<ul><li>The adverb inherently means in a natural or innate manner. Some people enjoy your inherently cheerful nature, but it drives other people crazy because they find you annoyingly perky.</li><li>Inherently is the adverbial form of the adjective inherent. They both come from the Latin word inhaerere, meaning ""adhere to,"" with the root haerere meaning ""to stick."" Synonyms for inherently include intrinsically and essentially. If you do something inherently, it is so well ingrained in you that it's become part of who you are. If you are inherently late to every meeting, you should probably set your watch 15 minutes early.</li></ul>"
inhibit,"<ul><li>When you inhibit something, you block it or hold it back. If you put plants in a dark room, you inhibit their growth. A teacher who mocks their students for giving wrong answers inhibits their willingness to speak up in class.</li><li>When you look at the word inhibit, think hinder. Though it sounds like it might be a bad thing to inhibit something else, there is no judgment built into the word. A drug that inhibits the growth of cancer cells would generally be considered a very good thing. While you may wish cancer cells to be inhibited, you probably don't wish it upon your friend's sense of humor or your country's economic growth.</li></ul>"
inhospitable,"<ul><li>Inhospitable places aren't easy or comfortable to live in, and inhospitable people can be downright unfriendly — even hostile. A hotel is particularly inhospitable if it's got uncomfortable beds and grouchy desk clerks.</li><li>Northern Minnesota is inhospitable in January, and many parts of India are inhospitable in the summertime — they are harsh, difficult places for most people. You're inhospitable to a visitor in your home if you don't offer a drink or ask if they want to sit, or in other ways try to make them comfortable. To be hospitable is to be friendly or pleasant, and when you add the ""not"" prefix in-, you get inhospitable.</li></ul>"
initial,"<ul><li>The first letter of your name is your initial. The first thing you say to someone is your initial greeting. Initial is something that occurs first or at the beginning.</li><li>If someone asks you to initial a form, they're asking you to sign by writing your initials on it. If your name is Inna Instant, you would write I.I., and you'd probably write it really quick! The first draft of a paper might be called your initial pass at getting your ideas down. If you say that these are your initial ideas, it implies that you will be coming up with more.</li></ul>"

If you say that these are your initial ideas, it implies that you will be coming up with more.</li></ul>"
initially,"<ul><li>The word initially can be used to describe an action that happened first. You might initially want fish for dinner, but then end up getting the pasta special that looks so good.</li><li>The adverb initially can describe something that happened at the beginning. Initially you might have thought the apartment was too small, but then you decided to take it because of the rooftop garden. You initially wanted to go to college far from home, but decided to stay closer to be near your family. The bride-to-be initially wanted an outdoor wedding, but decided against it because of the area's unpredictable weather.</li></ul>"
initiate,"<ul><li>If you want to end the feud between your siblings, you might need to initiate peace talks — and come up with a fair way to decide who gets the top bunk. As a verb, initiate means to start. As a noun, initiate refers to someone who has been inducted into a group.</li><li>Initiate is tricky because you pronounce the last bit one way as a verb (i-ni-she-ate) and another when it's a noun (i-ni-she-at). If you're an initiate, you've been introduced to a field of study, an activity, a club, etc. As a verb, to initiate is to begin, pioneer, or broach a topic. You might say, ""Let's initiate the swearing-in ceremony so our new initiates can join the Rule-Breakers' Club and still get home without missing their curfews.""</li></ul>"
innovation,"<ul><li>An innovation is the introduction of something new. If you run a magazine about new technology, then you're constantly looking out for the next innovation.</li><li>Innovation comes from Latin innovare for renew, whose root is novus or new. It can be used for either the act of introducing something new, as in a company that rewards creativity and innovation, or something that is newly introduced, like an innovation in microchip design. It was once used politically in the sense of revolution, but now you're most likely to hear it in relation to technology, or new ways of doing something.</li></ul>"
innovative,"<ul><li>Something innovative is new and original. If you love to experiment and find new ways to do things, you are an innovative person.</li><li>Innovative, like nova, novel, and novice, comes from the Latin novus, which means new. Something innovative renews or alters the way something has been done. You can use innovative to describe the thing or the person that made it. If your English teacher objects to your experimental writing style, tell him, ""I'm an innovative writer making innovative sentences!"" Antonyms are unoriginal and hackneyed.</li></ul>"
inordinate,"<ul><li>Something that's excessive or that goes way beyond normal limits is inordinate — like an overly obsessive love for chocolate or a fantasy football junkie who spends an inordinate amount of time checking his team.</li><li>The adjective inordinate is the exact opposite of ""reasonable"" and ""moderate."" In fact, when you call something inordinate, you're saying it's downright exorbitant and out of proportion. It's often used to describe abnormal amounts of time spent doing something — playing video games at work or canoodling with your girlfriend at school, for example. But as Oscar Wilde once said, “An inordinate passion for pleasure is the secret of remaining young.”</li></ul>"
insight into,
insistent,"<ul><li>Insistent means ""unwilling to let go or back down."" If a salesperson is insistent, you may find it hard to walk away without buying something.</li><li>Insistent shares a root with the verb insist: the Latin word insistere, which means ""persist, dwell upon, stand upon."" If you are insistent, you won't take ""no"" for an answer, dwelling on your ideas, standing up for your position. Insistent can also mean ""demanding attention,"" like the insistent ringing of the telephone at a busy office or the insistent cries of a hungry baby.</li></ul>"
install,"<ul><li>Use the verb install to mean ""set up"" or ""put in place."" You can install new software on your computer, or even install new officers to your honor society.</li><li>The word install traces back to the Latin word installare, from in-, meaning “into,” and stallum, meaning “place” or “stall.” Install has to do with putting someone or something in a chosen place. For example, you might install a solar panel on your roof, install your best friend in a cushy job at your company, or install yourself at the best table in your favorite restaurant.</li></ul>"
instant,"<ul><li>An instant is a very short time. In combinations like instant coffee and instant replay it means available right away without a wait.</li><li>Instant and moment mean the same thing if you are talking about a particular time in the past like you remember the instant or moment you realized that you had won the lottery. However, the two words are very different when talking about time in the future. ""I'll be there in an instant"" means you're coming as quickly as possible, whereas if you say ""I'll be there in a moment,"" someone is going to have to wait a bit for you.</li></ul>"
instantaneous,"<ul><li>Something instantaneous is happening right now, without delay. In today's society, the technology we carry in our pockets means people often expect an instantaneous or immediate response to emails and text messages.</li><li>Instantaneous comes from the Latin instant- meaning ""being at hand."" When something is instantaneous, it's right at hand when you need it. You can produce an instantaneous reply to someone or see an instantaneous change happen. If something happens very suddenly, you can describe it as instantaneous.</li></ul>"
instigate,"<ul><li>When you instigate something, you start it, but the word carries conflict with it. If you are suspended for wearing a political t-shirt, the incident might instigate days of protest by students and faculty.</li><li>Instigate comes from the Latin word instigare ""to incite."" People who are instigators often begin trouble but then back off and let others break the rules. If you instigate a food fight in the cafeteria, you might throw the first spoonful of mashed potatoes, but then you stop and let all the other students carry on the chaos. When something is instigated, the outcome tends to be unknown. The plan you instigate might not lead to the desired result.</li></ul>"
institute,"<ul><li>An institute is an organization or association designed to study or promote something. If you're interested in politics, you might want to do an internship at one of Washington D.C.'s many political research institutes.</li><li>While you may have heard of an institute, whether it’s the National Institute for Art Advancement or the National Cancer Institute, you may not know institute in its verb form. To institute something means to establish or advance it. You might institute the hiring of Spanish-speakers at your company, or, if workers complain about being overworked, you might institute a new policy on taking breaks.</li></ul>"
instructive,"<ul><li>Instructive means ""useful and informative."" Say you're visiting Paris and looking for the Eiffel Tower when a friendly Parisian native helpfully stops to draw you a map. ""Merci,"" you say. ""This map is very instructive.""</li><li>In English, anything that informs or enlightens is instructive, but in the Finnish language there's something called the instructive case, which is a whole separate way of saying ""by the means of."" An example would be a sentence like ""I traveled here by horse,"" which you would say differently than any other kind of sentence you might utter. You would also be speaking Finnish, so the information would only be instructive to Finns.</li></ul>"
insufficient,"<ul><li>If something is insufficient, it isn't enough. A high school diploma is very helpful for getting a job, but by itself, it's probably insufficient to land you a job as an astronaut.</li><li>Something adequate is sufficient, and something inadequate is insufficient (in- meaning ""not""). If you have $100 in the bank and you try to use a debit card for a $102 purchase, even though you’re close to having enough, your funds are insufficient to cover the sale. Anything that falls short of a required amount or expected measure is insufficient, whether it's the amount of air in a bike tire or the votes needed to win an election.</li></ul>"
intact,"<ul><li>If something is intact it's still in one piece. If you'd like your sand castle to remain intact, I suggest you build it away from the water.</li><li>The Latin word intactus means “untouched,” but today something is intact if it's whole, if it hasn't fallen apart. After a long day at work, you might feel lucky to be intact. Your letter to the post office states that you would prefer your packages to arrive intact from now on.</li></ul>"
intangible,"<ul><li>You can't touch this word — it is intangible. You can grasp the meaning of the word in your head, but you can't close your hands around it; you'll just put fingerprints on your monitor.</li><li>The Latin verb tangere means ""to touch,"" and the 16th-century English word tangible comes from it. Something intangible can't be touched physically, but most of the time it is understandable or even felt in the heart. Sadness can't be picked up and thrown in the garbage can because it is intangible, but you can throw away the tissues wet with tears. Laughing is intangible too, but you can hold onto movies, pets, and friends that make you laugh.</li></ul>"
integral,"<ul><li>Something that is integral is very important or necessary. If you are an integral part of the team, it means that the team cannot function without you.</li><li>An integral part is necessary to complete the whole. In this sense, the word essential is a near synonym. In mathematics, there are integrals of functions and equations. Integral is from Middle English, from Medieval Latin integralis ""making up a whole,"" from Latin  integer ""untouched, entire.""</li></ul>"
intense,"<ul><li>Intense means strong or extreme. If you accidentally spill a cup of hot coffee on yourself, you’ll probably feel intense heat, intense pain, and — if anyone happened to be watching — intense embarrassment.</li><li>When using intense, we often refer to a specific feeling or emotion, as in the case of “intense dread” or “intense happiness.” Intense can also be used to describe exciting experiences as well as people with strong or insistent personalities. For example, if your intense friend insists on taking you bungee jumping, you’re guaranteed to have an intense experience.  Intense comes from a Latin word meaning “stretched,” implying that something has been stretched to its maximum limit.</li></ul>"
intentionally,
intercourse,
intermediate,"<ul><li>Use the adjective intermediate when you find yourself in that in-between stage, like after you complete an introductory class but before you are ready for the advanced stuff.</li><li>The word intermediate comes from the Latin intermediatus, tracing back to intermedius, which combines inter-, meaning “between” and medius, meaning “middle.” So you can see that intermediate describes something or someone in the middle, between two distinct phases, like an intermediate swimmer who has mastered the basic strokes but isn't yet ready to join the racing team.</li></ul>"
intermingle,"<ul><li>Things that intermingle get mixed up with each other. Tall grasses and daisies might intermingle in your parents' backyard, but your parents may choose not to intermingle with their neighbors.</li><li>When kids from diverse backgrounds intermingle in school, they learn more about people who are different from themselves, and when several different flavors intermingle successfully in a recipe, the taste is complex and delicious. Intermingle intermingles the prefix inter-, ""among or between"" and mingle, from the Middle English myngen, ""to mix,"" from a Proto-Germanic root meaning ""to knead together.""</li></ul>"
intimate,"<ul><li>Intimate means being close. A small restaurant is called intimate because you're sitting close to the other people, and your best friends are considered your intimate friends.</li><li>This adjective can mean very friendly, or very personal or private. The original spelling was intime, from French, from Latin intimus ""innermost,"" from intus ""within."" The related verb intimate means to hint or suggest. Intimate is also a noun meaning a close friend or associate. You might intimate to your intimates that you want to leave a boring party.</li></ul>"
intricate,"<ul><li>Intricate things are complex and have many elements: they're not simple. Think of the intricate wiring of a computer's motherboard, or the intricate plot of a movie that you have a hard time following.</li><li>Anything intricate is complicated. Chess is a very intricate game that you could study your entire life and still not know everything about. On the other hand, a game like Connect Four is not very intricate. The more details and parts something has, the more intricate it is. A two-part plan isn't very intricate. A 2000-step plan is intricate; it's harder to wrap your head around.</li></ul>"
intrigue,"<ul><li>An intrigue is a secret plot. If you ever become the monarch of a small island kingdom, keep watch for signs of any intrigue against you.</li><li>Intrigue comes from the Latin verb intricare,  to entangle, and is related to intricate. It can be a noun, meaning underhanded plot, or a verb for the act of plotting. Agents of two opposing powers intrigue against each other. In the late nineteenth century it also came to mean the feeling of curiosity or interest. If someone's ideas intrigue you, you want to know more about them.</li></ul>"
intriguing,"<ul><li>Intriguing things or people arouse curiosity and have an indescribable draw. If you find the night sky intriguing and enjoy pondering the limitlessness of the universe, you should consider becoming an astronomer.</li><li>When this adjective was first recorded in the 1600’s, anything intriguing had something to do with  “tricking, deceiving, or cheating.” It wasn't until much later that intriguing lost its sinister sense and became simply a word to describe something with alluring mystery. Synonyms for intriguing run the gamut from captivating and delightful to riveting and titillating.</li></ul>"
intrinsic,"<ul><li>The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.</li><li>Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic, for things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.</li></ul>"
intrusive,"<ul><li>Something intrusive is getting in your face or invading your space. Nosey questions, a poke in the ribs, and a hovering mother are all intrusive.</li><li>Things that are intrusive are a real pain in the neck: they intrude on you. If someone asks you a million questions, especially personal questions, that's intrusive behavior. When photographers hound celebrities, they're being intrusive. If a rock is sticking out and getting in people's way, then it's intrusive. All meanings of intrusive involve something being where it doesn't belong.</li></ul>"
invade,"<ul><li>When you Invade, you aggressively take over or occupy a place. If a country's leader wants to gain more land, the military might invade a neighboring country.</li><li>Not everything that invades is militaristic. Some things that invade are cultural, such as the phenomena of young, stylish people moving into a neighborhood that had never been thought of as cool before. In an instant, new restaurants and shops catering to the newcomers open and soon the area is overrun with people wearing, say, skinny jeans and complicated eyewear. Natives to the area lament, ""This place has been invaded by hipsters.""</li></ul>"
invaluable,"<ul><li>If you're robbed, much of what is stolen can be replaced. All you need is the cash value of what was lost. But some things––family photos, heirloom jewelry––are invaluable, meaning extremely valuable, or priceless.</li><li>At first glance, you would think that invaluable means ""not valuable."" But to understand its meaning, you'd have to know that it was formed from the prefix in- ""not"" plus the verb value, plus the suffix –able ""able to be."" So something invaluable has such great value that its value can't be calculated.</li></ul>"
invariably,"<ul><li>Invariably describes things that don't change and never vary — they're predictable. Many people invariably start each morning with a hot cup of coffee.</li><li>This adverb is useful when discussing things that happen all the time or don't change. In football, teams that win the Super Bowl invariably have a good defense. In schools, many students invariably struggle with writing. Invariably, the weather is hard to predict. In a lot of cases, invariably means always or almost always. You can count on things that are invariable.</li></ul>"
invent,"<ul><li>To invent is to create for the first time or make up. If you tell your friends that you invented the electric guitar, you are inventing a pretty unbelievable story about your past.</li><li>When you think of the word invent, think of Thomas Alva Edison who invented the long-lasting light bulb, the motion picture camera, the phonograph, and the stock ticker. That's a lot of inventions! You couldn't invent a better story of American ingenuity, could you?</li></ul>"
inviolable,"<ul><li>Wedding vows and vault combinations that can’t be broken are considered inviolable. (Of course, divorce lawyers and bank robbers consider this a challenge.)</li><li>The word can refer to a physical structure (a fortress, for instance) or something more conceptual (human rights or morals, perhaps). Inviolable has changed little from its Latin origin of inviolabilis, which combines the prefix in- (meaning ""not"") with the verb violare (""to violate""). Inviolable turns up in religious settings too, usually in reference to texts or rites. In that context, it means ""sacred."" No surprise: the antonym of inviolable is violable (""accessible or penetrable"").</li></ul>"
invoke,"<ul><li>To invoke is to call up something such as a law, a higher power, or even a ghost. In court, you might invoke the Fifth Amendment (the right not to say something that will make you look bad) if you don't want to talk.</li><li>You can invoke all kinds of people or ideas, alive or dead: ""She invokes the spirit of good writing when she proofreads her work."" In a time of need, you might invoke a higher power. You could invoke Martin Luther King when talking about equal rights. You might even invoke the spirit of your dead cat at a séance. Just make sure you don't evoke (to bring on a strong emotional reaction) your dead cat; that would just be weird.</li></ul>"
irrecoverable,
isolated,"<ul><li>Isolated means far away from everyone or everything else. The hermit who lives on a remote island is isolated from the rest of the world, with nothing but coconuts and fish to keep him company.</li><li>The word isolated comes from the Latin word insula, which means island. You don't have to be on a remote island to feel isolated, though. Even people who live in big cities can feel a sense of isolation if they don't have many friends and spend a lot of time alone. In addition to remote or set apart, isolated can mean a single event, or incident. The high school students assured their principal that the cafeteria food fight was an isolated incident, promising that it would never, ever happen again.</li></ul>"
jettison,"<ul><li>Jettison means to push to the side or toss away. If a boat is leaking or an airplane is running out of fuel, you can buy more time by jettisoning cargo, or throwing it overboard.</li><li>The word jettison — dating, in its nautical meaning, from the 15th century in English — is commonly used figuratively as well as literally. You can jettison a friendship or an attitude. During the month that the Winter Olympics are aired on TV, figure-skating fans across the country jettison homework and other responsibilities in order to watch.</li></ul>"
jointly,"<ul><li>When more than one person or group works on something together, they do it jointly. A jointly researched and written term paper should have both the authors' names on the first page.</li><li>If you and your best friend buy a car together, you do it jointly, and if your whole family chips in to fund your cousin's trip to India, you contribute jointly. You might hear that your favorite radio program is jointly supported by a few local businesses, or read in a poetry magazine that it's jointly edited by two people. Earlier, the preferred word was joinly, though jointly comes from joint and its sense of connection.</li></ul>"
jolt,"<ul><li>To jolt someone is to disturb them or make them jump. A jolt is sudden and jarring.</li><li>Jolting disturbs or surprises people. If you surprise someone and they jump up a little, you jolted them. Alarm clocks jolt people out of sleep. A sudden crack of thunder could provide a jolt. The unexpected barking of a dog could jolt you. Jolting is quick and not very pleasant. A jolt jars and stuns you. Some jolts are more serious: crashing your car jolts the people in the car violently.</li></ul>"
judge,"<ul><li>To judge is to form your own opinion. The critics didn't think much of the movie, but you decided to judge for yourself. Now you can't get your money back.</li><li>A person who judges, especially for a living, is known as a judge. To this day, you believe the judges cheated you out of the gold medal for figure skating because they didn't like your outfit. If you're wearing handcuffs and a police officer says, “Tell it to the judge,” that's the one in the black robes, not the one that holds up scorecards. Hopefully, this judge will like your outfit.</li></ul>"
junction,"<ul><li>The noun junction refers to a meeting or a joining of some kind. If you live at the junction of Main and State streets, then your house is where those two streets meet.</li><li>Junction often refers to the point where streets or railway lines come together, but it can describe other things that are joined, especially things that are in motion or transmit other things. For example, your body has nerve junctions — the places where your nerves come together. You may go swimming at the junction of two rivers. Junction can also refer to something that connects things, like a junction you use to connect electrical cords.</li></ul>"
juncture,"<ul><li>A juncture is a crucial point in time when a decision must be made. At this juncture, a president might say, the government must decide whether to go ahead with war or to try to solve things diplomatically.</li><li>A juncture is a joint or connection between two things. Originally used in the physical sense, it has broadened in meaning to refer to an often urgent decision-making crossroads. At some point you and your partner will reach a critical juncture and have to decide whether to get serious or break up. It can also simply mean ""point in time."" She had never learned how to drive and, at this juncture, she knew she never would.</li></ul>"
justified,"<ul><li>In typesetting, the term justified refers to how words line up with the margins of a page or column. Whether you choose to make the text left, right, or fully justified depends on the purpose of the text.</li><li>If you're typing a letter, you may want the date and your address to be right justified. The last character on each line would touch the right margin. The salutation (the part that says, ""Dear Sir or Madam"") would be left justified, with the D touching the left margin. The body of the letter could be left justified, with the right margin uneven, or fully justified, with both the right and left aligned.</li></ul>"
justify,"<ul><li>To justify is to make excuses for one's actions, like the dieter who has to justify the few tiny pieces of chocolate she's sneaked in between salads.</li><li>Anyone who has ever made excuses for his or her actions knows the meaning of justify, like the bank robber who justifies his latest heist by claiming he needs the bank's money to support his charitable foundation. He might think he's got a good reason for holding up the bank, but he's going to have a hard time convincing the bank's owner of his reason, or justification. To justify a line of text is to space it so that it lines up with the margin.</li></ul>"
justly,
keep tune to,
key,"<ul><li>A key is a piece of metal that fits inside a lock and turns to open it. You might have a key ring with a house key, a car key, and maybe several more keys.</li><li>A key is typically cut from metal, although many hotels use plastic keys for their guest rooms. If you are told that your attendance is key, you know you have to go. Another meaning of key is a button or lever you press with your fingers, like a piano key or a typewriter key. A key is also an explanation, like the answer key for a test or the key to success. And when you sing in key, you have the correct pitch.</li></ul>"
lading,
landscape,"<ul><li>To landscape is to enhance a space with plants. If you landscape your yard with flowering plants and trees — and you have a green thumb — you'll end up with a beautiful garden.</li><li>If you paint nature scenes, like mountains, lakes, or fields, your art is called landscape painting. If you don't paint that well, however, and the perspective on your landscapes is always a little bit off, you can try landscape photography instead. Any expanse of natural scenery that can be seen from one viewpoint is also called a landscape. The artistic meaning of landscape is the earliest, dating from the 1600s.</li></ul>"
lap,"<ul><li>Your lap is the top of your thighs when you sit down, where your cat might sit. Lap can also refer to a trip around a racetrack, or to the act of overtaking a competitor by a lap.</li><li>Lap is associated with a number of idioms. If something ""falls into your lap,"" you have gotten something without making much effort. For example, maybe you discovered a rare fossil in your yard while looking for your lost baseball. If you sold that fossil for a lot of money, you may find yourself now ""sitting in the lap of luxury."" That’s a wonderful place to be!</li></ul>"
large,"<ul><li>Large means the size of an item, such as clothing, that falls between medium and extra-large. If you realize your size has changed from medium to large, it might be time to cut back on the cupcakes.</li><li>Something that is above average in size or number can be described with the adjective large. Your large collection of bottle caps, which covers the walls of three rooms in your house, is a perfect example. Large also describes something that covers a broad spectrum or scope. You might love being an American studies major because your classes cover a large range of topics.</li></ul>"
largely,"<ul><li>Use the adverb largely to mean ""mostly."" You might say that you're largely pleased with the way your favorite baseball team played this season if they won more games than they lost.</li><li>If a group art project was largely completed at your house, that means you primarily worked on it there, and when a once-popular novelist is largely forgotten, she's generally fallen out of favor with today's readers. Largely is a useful alternative to ""mostly,"" ""mainly,"" or ""chiefly,"" and it comes from the adjective large, in Old French ""broad, wide, or generous,"" from a Latin root, largus, ""abundant, plentiful, bountiful, or liberal.""</li></ul>"
lateral,"<ul><li>When something is extending to the side or moving to the side, it’s lateral. ""All of the lateral movement in tennis hurt her knees and she had to quit playing.""</li><li>The adjective lateral comes from the Latin word lateralis, which means “belonging to the side” and the modern meaning is basically the same. In anatomy, views of the body from the left, as well as from the right  are referred to as lateral. You can make a lateral career move, if the compensation and level of responsibility stay about the same (instead of moving up, you are moving to the side). A lateral pass in football is one that goes to the side or behind the passer, instead of directly towards the goal.</li></ul>"
launch,"<ul><li>To launch something is to propel it or get it going, usually from a standing position. You can launch a rocket, a career, a product or even a watermelon. Either way, you're getting it off the ground.</li><li>Launch often means to start something, but to start it in a big way: ""The launch of the shuttle was also the launch of a new era in space travel."" Time was, when a singer finished making her record, the company would simply ""release it."" Eventually, though, that wasn't enough. Now a record needs ""a launch"" — a full-scale media blitz to get people excited enough to buy it.</li></ul>"
lax,"<ul><li>Those parents who let their kids eat all their Halloween candy the night of October 31st? Their parenting style might be described as lax. A paperclip chain used as a bike lock? That's an example of lax security.</li><li>While contemplating the word lax, you may note that it's the same as the first syllable in laxative. This is not a coincidence: lax entered English as a noun describing a substance taken or administered to relax the bowels. Interestingly, the modern definition of lax is closer to the Latin source word, laxus — an adjective meaning ""loose."" Now, lax can refer to any phenomenon that is insufficiently stringent or so slack as to be basically ineffectual. For example, ""The entire class performed incredibly well on the test, largely due to the sleepy professor's lax supervision.""</li></ul>"
legitimacy,"<ul><li>The noun legitimacy means authenticity. If you found an old copy of the Gettysburg Address in your grandmother's attic, you'd have to question its legitimacy when you realized it was written on the back of a car advertisement.</li><li>Legitimacy comes from the Latin verb legitimare, which means lawful. Legitimacy, then, refers to something that is legal because it meets the specific requirements of the law. The legitimacy of various countries' presidential elections is often discussed, with monitors keeping track of the voting procedures to make sure they follow all the necessary rules.</li></ul>"
legitimately,
leisure,"<ul><li>Leisure is time off, spare time, sweet sweet freedom from the demands of work. It's like playtime for grown-ups.</li><li>Leisure is time away from commitments like work or school.  Leisure activities might include windsailing, golfing, crocheting a portrait of Betsy Ross, staring at one's navel, whatever. It's the freedom to do what the heck you want. It's not time for punching the clock or writing a paper on the role of matchsticks in the Industrial Revolution; it's kick-your-shoes-off time. If you read a book at your leisure, there's no rush. Leisure is more rare for some than others. ""The billionaire was a woman of leisure,"" but leisure time is a luxury for most.</li></ul>"
leisurely,"<ul><li>Leisurely is a word that describes something that is unhurried and easygoing, like the leisurely bike ride you may take home when you know have a lot of work waiting for you there.</li><li>Whether it's an adjective or adverb, leisurely is in no rush to finish; instead it strolls down the lane slowly in its relaxed, laid-back way, and it probably stops to smell the flowers as it goes. If you work at a leisurely pace, you probably don't have a supervisor breathing down your neck to see how much work you’re doing at every second of the day. Leisurely is often found on the same page as pleasure.</li></ul>"
lethal,"<ul><li>Lethal refers to anything dangerous enough to cause death. The cobra's venom is so lethal that if you get bitten and can't find the antidote, it's lights out forever.</li><li>Poisonous spiders, guns, knives, and radiation — all of these things can be lethal because they have the ability to kill. Even some substances that on their own aren't dangerous can become lethal in large quantities. Eating a peanut butter sandwich won't hurt most people, but it can be lethal to those with a nut allergy. Words like deadly and fatal mean the same as lethal.</li></ul>"
liberal,"<ul><li>A liberal is someone on the left wing of politics — the opposite of a conservative. Also, a liberal attitude toward anything means more tolerance for change.</li><li>There are many meanings for liberal, but they mostly have to do with freedom and openness to change. A teacher with a liberal policy toward attendance is going to be forgiving of missed days. A bank with a liberal attitude toward your money would probably be bad: some things are awful if they're loose and free. But no one will give you a hard time if you use a liberal amount of catsup on your fries.</li></ul>"
liken,"<ul><li>When you liken one thing to another, you compare them and point out what they have in common. You might liken your long walk to school to your ancestors' voyage across the ocean to the New World.</li><li>When you equate two things, or emphasize their similarities, you liken them. You could liken your experience at the dentist to torture, or liken your dad's skill at baking pies to that of Rembrandt painting a portrait. Your grandmother might liken her romance with your grandfather to a fairy tale, and you could then liken the day you spent listening to her stories to watching a long, dull movie.</li></ul>"
likewise,"<ul><li>Likewise means ""similarly.""  Your attempt to bypass security with a fake ID was unsuccessful, and your guise as a pizza deliverer was likewise ineffective.</li><li>Likewise is an adverb with three different senses. One is ""similarly."" You were unimpressed with your brother's poetry, and likewise unimpressed with his taste in music. Likewise can also mean ""in addition,"" and ""equally."" Your new t-shirts sold well at the beach boutique, and likewise they sold well on line. If you want to tell someone you feel the way he does, say, ""I feel likewise.""</li></ul>"
linger,"<ul><li>When someone lingers, he or she takes an unexpectedly long time to depart, as Romeo lingers when bidding Juliet farewell (or as annoying houseguests almost always tend to do).</li><li>In addition to its primary meaning of ""taking a long time to depart,"" linger has the additional meaning of ""persisting while gradually weakening."" In this sense, linger can refer to feelings or sensations that slowly fade away, like the smell of perfume that lingers in an elevator after the passengers have exited.</li></ul>"
link,"<ul><li>Before it was the universal word for traveling around the Internet, link was just a connection or a device that connects things, like the links in a chain.</li><li>Much of what humans do in their day-to-day life involves looking for links — or relationships between people and things. When there is a link, that means two things are connected — such as ""the link between smoking and lung cancer."" Some people even create links, like butchers who make sausage links and website developers who hyperlink the sites you visit to ensure that you spend far too much time clicking around the Web.</li></ul>"
listening,
little short miraculous,
livelihood,"<ul><li>Your livelihood is the job you work at to earn the income that supports you.</li><li>The word livelihood started out as the Old English līflād, or ""course of life,"" and around the 13th century changed to livelode, which meant ""a means of keeping one alive."" As ""-lode"" morphed into ""-hood,"" which meant ""state, condition,"" the meaning of the word also changed to mean support for a person's life. That naturally came to mean your job, which provides the monetary support to keep you going.</li></ul>"
locale,"<ul><li>A locale is the specific place where something happens. If you dream of a trip to some tropical locale, Hawaii, Belize, and Costa Rica might all be on your wish list.</li><li>When you choose a locale for a big sci-fi convention, you need to make sure there's enough room for all the participants. And when you decide on a locale for an intimate party, you might stick to a cozy spot like your own living room. Locale comes from the French local, and it was originally spelled the same way. The e was eventually added to encourage correct pronunciation, with the emphasis on the last syllable.</li></ul>"
locate,"<ul><li>If you wanted to decide where to locate your car wash, you might locate a spot on a map with lots of traffic, a parking lot, and a ready source of water. Locate means to find or place.</li><li>If your mother can never locate her keys, it means she loses them all of the time and has to look all around the house before going out. If you move to a new place, usually for a job, you relocate. But if you decide to find a job that is located in your town, you call that staying local, which, like locate, derives from the Latin locus meaning ""place.""</li></ul>"
lucrative,"<ul><li>Use lucrative to refer to a business or investment that makes money. While your parents might want you to pursue a lucrative career, you're committed to your plan of becoming a professional mime.</li><li>This adjective is from the Latin word lucrum, meaning ""profit."" In Latin, lucrum also meant ""greed,"" a negative sense preserved in the English phrase filthy lucre, or ""shameful profit or gain."" But the word lucrative doesn't carry a similar sense of shame — if your lawn-mowing job proves lucrative over the summer, you might be able to buy yourself a used car.</li></ul>"
luxuriant,"<ul><li>You can use the adjective luxuriant to describe something really luxurious or full and lush. If you walk through a dense forest after it rains, it's really luxuriant with green plants overgrowing the paths.</li><li>Natural, growing things are luxuriant when they're fertile and full of life. People and places that show a fullness of life and wealth are also luxuriant. If you enter a room full of deep, plush couches and expensive decorations you're in a luxuriant space. And anything really enjoyable to the senses — whether costly or not — can be luxuriant, like a really rich and creamy piece of warm vanilla cake with a large hot chocolate: that's luxuriant.</li></ul>"
magnify,"<ul><li>To magnify is to make something bigger, whether in size or in significance.</li><li>A magnifying glass makes things look bigger and when anything is magnified, it gets larger in some way. If your hunger is magnified, you've gotten hungrier. Wearing a heavy coat on a hot day will magnify the heat: you're feeling hotter and hotter. Also, non-physical things get magnified. The press could magnify a story by discussing it over and over, making it a bigger story than it was originally. All types of magnifying make things bigger.</li></ul>"
magnitude,"<ul><li>Earthquakes have great magnitude in that they are powerful. Their power is rated by their level of magnitude, or how much energy they release relative to other earthquakes.</li><li>In math, magnitude compares numbers by powers of 10. If your weekly allowance was $10, but your brother's was $100, his allowance would be one order of magnitude higher than yours. If your sister's was $10,000, hers would be three orders of magnitude higher. A difference of that magnitude is just not fair!</li></ul>"
maintain,"<ul><li>Maintain means to keep the same––keep steady, keep up, or keep going. Sure, you can ride your bike super fast on a flat surface, but it can be hard to maintain that speed, or keep the same speed, going up a hill.</li><li>When you maintain a strict study schedule, you stick to it. When you maintain your car in good working order, you take good care of it. If you maintain records of your business activity, it means you make notes of your sales and expenses. If a teacher maintains order in the classroom, she never lets disruptions get out of hand. If you maintain your family, you keep them in food, shelter and clothing. If you maintain that eating animals is cruel, you keep that position.</li></ul>"
majestic,"<ul><li>Majestic things display great dignity, befit a great ruler, or are simply far superior to everyday stuff. Compared with a peasant's hut, for instance, a king's palace is quite majestic.</li><li>The adjective majestic has origins in the Latin word majestatem, meaning ""greatness, dignity, honor, or excellence."" It's often used to describe things connected with kings and queens (whom, you'll remember, we often address as ""Your Majesty""). We also like to refer to the great creatures and places of the natural world as majestic: Mt. Fuji in Japan for example, or a bald eagle flying over the Grand Canyon.</li></ul>"
make their way,
malleable,"<ul><li>A malleable metal is able to be pounded or pressed into various shapes, and a malleable personality is capable of being changed or trained. It's easier to learn when you're young and malleable.</li><li>Just as there are substances that are malleable, including clay and some metals, there are also ductile metals that can be hammered out into wire or thread; gold, silver, and platinum are examples. The adjective malleable dates back to Middle English, from Old French, from Medieval Latin malleābilis, from malleāre, ""to hammer.""</li></ul>"
manage,"<ul><li>To manage is to skillfully handle something. If you can barely manage to keep your goldfish alive, you should probably think twice about adopting those Golden Retriever puppies.</li><li>The verb manage also means to supervise or oversee either things or people at work. You might manage six people at the donut shop, even though you've only worked there for four months. If you carefully manage your donut shop earnings, you should be able to buy that new car next year. Manage also means to cope with or come to terms with. It might seem scary to go to college in another state, but I know you'll manage.</li></ul>"
mandatory,"<ul><li>In the US, attending school through the twelfth grade, driving on the right side of the road, and obtaining a social security number are all mandatory. The phrase ""mandatory requirement"" is redundant.</li><li>A mandatory action is something that is required, obligatory, or compulsory. Like letting your Great Aunt Edna pinch your cheeks or passing gym to get your diploma. Mandatory is often used in opposition to optional. If you want to compete with the swim team at school, weeknight practices are mandatory, meaning you have to go, though the Saturday dawn swim practice remains optional, meaning it's up to you.</li></ul>"
manifest,"<ul><li>Choose the verb manifest when someone shows something for everyone to notice. You might manifest your dislike of school food by stirring it around into a big pile of slop on your tray.</li><li>Coming from the Latin manifestus, ""caught in the act,"" manifest can be used as an adjective or a noun as well as a verb. As an adjective, manifest is a formal way to say that something is apparent to the senses and is synonymous with evident, apparent, or clear. If you have strong feelings about something, they will be manifest on your face. A ship or plane's manifest is the list of cargo or passengers on a particular trip.</li></ul>"
manipulate,"<ul><li>To manipulate something means to handle it skillfully, like the way a sculptor manipulates clay or a really good politician works a crowd.</li><li>The verb manipulate evolved from manipulation, which back in the 1700s referred to a method of digging ore. So manipulating something originally only meant moving or arranging it by hand or mechanically. It wasn't until 1864 that people started using the word manipulate to describe someone exerting mental or emotional influence on others.</li></ul>"
marked,"<ul><li>Marked is an adjective meaning “clear” or “noticeable.” Filling your living room with pictures of pandas will show your marked  appreciation for all things panda.</li><li>The adjective marked can have several senses. In addition to meaning “very noticeable,” it can be used in relation to the noun mark, as in “to show a mark.” You may have also heard the expression a “marked man.” Marked in this sense means to have been chosen for punishment or a bad ending. Trip your opponent in this year’s field day sack race, and you will likely find yourself a marked man at the next contest.</li></ul>"
markedly,"<ul><li>If something happens in a significant way or to a great degree, you can say it occurs markedly. If the price of milk rises markedly, you'll notice it the next time you're grocery shopping.</li><li>When the acting on your favorite bad TV show improves markedly, you might guess that all the actors took acting lessons over the summer. And if the speed limit in your city is markedly lowered, you'll feel a lot safer riding your bike around town. The adverb markedly comes from marked and its sense of ""having a mark,"" from the Old English mearc, ""sign or mark.""</li></ul>"
marvelously,
mask,"<ul><li>A mask is a disguise that covers just your face. Your Halloween costume might include a scary monster mask and a furry suit with a tail, or maybe you just wear that for fun.</li><li>You can wear a mask to conceal your identity, to dress up as a character for a party or holiday, to scare someone, or to make someone laugh. Robbers sometimes wear masks so they can't be identified, and an actor might wear a mask while playing the role of a rabbit in a play. Other masks are useful, including masks that protect patients from germs and masks that keep skiers' faces warm.</li></ul>"
massive,"<ul><li>Massive means enormous. Obviously, Mt. Everest is massive, but a massive budget cut isn't necessarily big in physical mass; it's something that is imposing in scale or power. A massive budget cut can do a lot of damage.</li><li>Unless someone is referring to your intellect, massive is not a word you want used in a description of your attributes. Massive is a nice one to trot out when huge, gigantic, and enormous sound too over-the-top.  Politicians use it often. Massive could also be the best way to describe the wave you surfed on your Hawaiian vacation or the size of the fish you nearly caught on that trip with your friends.</li></ul>"
mastery,"<ul><li>Mastery refers to having great skill at something or total dominance over something. If you are fluent in French, you have a mastery of the language. If you win every game of chess, you show a mastery of the game.</li><li>Mastery is from master, who is someone knowledgeable about a subject, like a master painter. Masters are also people with power — butlers sometimes call their employer master. Mastery refers to a similar power or ability. Beethoven showed mastery in composing. Shakespeare displayed mastery in writing. Apple has had mastery over the field of computers and smartphones. Often, both senses are mixed: if someone has mastery over a field skill-wise, they probably have mastery in terms of dominance too.</li></ul>"
materialize,"<ul><li>When you materialize, you show up suddenly after being missing, unborn, or unseen. Think of Harry Potter removing his invisibility cloak. He materializes.</li><li>Living things aren't the only things that materialize. Car keys and reading glasses materialize when you've been searching for them for a while and then they are suddenly there on the table. If you're lucky an unexpected business deal will materialize. Like material, the word is related to the Latin word meaning ""matter."" Matter, is, of course, all the stuff of this earth, anything and everything that takes form. So to materialize is to take form.</li></ul>"
matter,"<ul><li>Matter is everywhere: anything that has mass and takes up space is matter. Air? Donuts? People? Buildings? Melted butter? All of these, and much, much more, are matter.</li><li>Other kinds of matter don't have a physical form, like a concern, problem, or even something that people think about, like a worrisome money matter, a personal matter, or a movie with a particular subject matter. Matter can also be a verb, meaning ""to be important,"" as in: ""Good health matters to me.""</li></ul>"
mature,"<ul><li>Someone who is mature acts grown up, like an adult. However, when one sister says to another, ""That's so mature,""  she's usually using the word sarcastically, because her sister has done something very immature, like sticking out her tongue.</li><li>The adjective mature doesn't only describe advancing age, although the residents of a senior citizens' home could definitely be considered mature. Anything that is fully developed, like an aged cheese or bottle of wine, can also be called mature. The word can also refer to something that is only appropriate for people who are considered legal adults, like the movie that is for ""mature audiences only.""</li></ul>"
maximum,"<ul><li>Both a noun and an adjective, maximum takes it to the max: it means the most, the fastest, the biggest.</li><li>""The most you can have is the maximum"": that's the noun. In ""the maximum amount is the most you can have,"" it's used as an adjective. You might be familiar with the shortened version of the word: the ""max."" If you take something ""to the max,"" you're doing as much of it as possible. You take it to the limit. You take it to the maximum.</li></ul>"
mean,"<ul><li>If you got a fortune cookie with the message ""Your future will contain many bananas,"" you might ask, ""What on earth does that mean?"" In other words, you wonder what the intention or meaning of the fortune might be.</li><li>Mean is one of those ordinary, everyday words with lots of different meanings. The adjective mean can describe someone who's stingy or ungenerous, but it also means ""unkind or unfair,"" which is what a little kid intends to convey when she yells at her mother, ""You're mean!"" In the sentence, ""She lived in a mean little house,"" mean has yet another meaning, this time being ""shabby or poor.""</li></ul>"
mechanism,"<ul><li>Use the word mechanism to describe a process that has been set up to accomplish a particular goal. If you’ve set up a method for dealing with your sister when she annoys you, then you have a mechanism in place for establishing peace with your sister.</li><li>The word mechanism came into the English language in the seventeenth century by way of the Latin word mechanismus, which traces back to the Greek word mekhane, meaning “device"" or ""means.” Mechanism still carries with it the meaning of “device” and can be used to describe a machine, but nowadays you are more likely to hear it used to describe a process for getting something done, such as ""a mechanism for generating revenue"" or ""a crisis-resolution mechanism.""</li></ul>"
mere subsistence,
merely,"<ul><li>Merely means ""only."" If you say ""I was merely trying to help,"" your efforts were probably not appreciated and you're likely to be stalking off with your nose in the air.</li><li>Merely comes from the Latin merus, (""undiluted""). But ""undiluted"" is positive — as in, ""that's the undiluted truth"" — in a way that merely is not. When you use merely, it always has a negative, disapproving tinge to it: You might say, ""She was merely a minor player in that drama,"" but if you said, ""She was merely the star of the show,"" you would mean it ironically, since being the star is the most important role.</li></ul>"
merge,"<ul><li>The verb merge means to seamlessly join something. For example, when you merge onto the highway, you need to smoothly join the traffic, forgetting everything you learned riding the bumper cars at the fair.</li><li>If two or more things become one, they merge. If your favorite deli, The Cheese Stop, merges with a sandwich shop called Chez Lui, the two restaurants might also merge their names, becoming Chez Cheese. You can also use merge when things only appear to blend. You know it's time to go to sleep when the words in your book begin to merge together.</li></ul>"
merit,"<ul><li>Merit means ""worthiness or excellence."" If you receive a certificate of merit in school, you are being recognized for doing a good job. As a verb, merit means ""deserve."" Your certificate might merit a prominent place on your bulletin board!</li><li>You will often hear the phrases ""merit-based promotion"" and ""merit-based pay,"" which come up when employees are pushing against a system in which time on the job — and not job performance — determines when workers are promoted and how much they are paid. Using the word merit suggests impartiality and objectivity — such as when you swear off a prejudiced approach to something and vow to ""judge it on its merits.""</li></ul>"
meticulously,"<ul><li>If you clean your house meticulously, you take plenty of time and scour every single nook and cranny, maybe even behind the oven and under the doormat.</li><li>Meticulous means extremely careful and thorough, so if you do something meticulously, you are painstaking about doing it perfectly. Someone who would never leave her house with an un-ironed t-shirt or a thread hanging loose is someone who dresses meticulously. If your town historian documents every event, from births to remodeled living rooms, then she does her job meticulously, maybe a little too meticulously.</li></ul>"
microbe,"<ul><li>Microbe is a somewhat outdated way for scientists to talk about the tiny bugs that cause diseases. When you get the flu, you can blame a microbe.</li><li>In the nineteenth century, the idea that germs caused illness was brand new, and doctors referred to both germs and microbes interchangeably. The word microorganism is more scientifically precise, and in fact microbe is a shortened form of that long, Greek-rooted word. Mikro means ""small,"" and in microbe it's combined with bios, or ""life.""</li></ul>"
milestone,"<ul><li>A milestone is a significant event in your life. Often a milestone marks the start of a new chapter. For example, the day you graduated from high school was a milestone in your life.</li><li>Milestone literally refers to a roadside marker that lists the distance to a particular location. These days, the word is more often used figuratively to refer to significant events in life, like graduating from college or getting married. It acts sort of like the road sign: it's often a moment when you reflect on where you stand in life. A milestone can also be a nonpersonal event that results in a big change, such as a milestone victory or a company's sales milestone.</li></ul>"
milky way,
mimic,"<ul><li>A mimic is someone who is good at imitating others. A gifted mimic might be able to imitate one president after another just by minimally changing facial expression and manner of speaking.</li><li>Mimic, related to mime (""an entertainer who performs using gestures not speech""), can be traced back to the Greek mimeisthai, ""to imitate."" Usually when you mimic someone, you imitate them in order to make fun of them. Performers mimic famous people to get laughs, but ordinary people mimic others when they are angry at them. Who hasn't mimicked parents or a boss who has said no one too many times?!</li></ul>"
miniature,"<ul><li>Things that are miniature are teeny tiny versions of something else. Think miniature poodle. Unless you don't like small dogs. Then think miniature footballs. Aww, cute.</li><li>When something is a miniature, it is like it has been shrunk down in size. It's not just small, it's a small replica of something else. If you made a dollhouse that was a scale representation of your own house, it would be a miniature of your home. It would also be a little weird.</li></ul>"
minuscule,"<ul><li>When something is teeny tiny, it is minuscule. If your mother calls your miniskirt minuscule, it probably means she wants you to change into something a bit less revealing.</li><li>In minuscule, you see the word, minus, which means lesser. The word minuscule has its roots in the Latin expression minuscula littera, a phrase used to describe the smaller letters in text. In the late 1800s, the use of the word expanded to mean very small in general — so the definition of minuscule became less minuscule.</li></ul>"
minute,"<ul><li>Craftsmen can paint whole villages or detailed portraits of people on a grain of rice using minute, or tiny, paintbrushes. Often the works of art are so minute that you can only see them with a magnifying glass.</li><li>Minutus is the Latin word for ""small,"" and it gave rise to both the adjective minute (my-NOOT), or incredibly small, and the noun minute (MIN-it), or 60 seconds of time. Though they are pronounced differently, both words refer to small measurements. An object can be minute, like a flea compared with its dog, and less concrete things can be minute, like your minute chance of winning the lottery. A minute freckle on the side of your nose is a minute detail of your whole face.</li></ul>"
minutely,"<ul><li>Do something minutely and you'll do it in an attentive or meticulous, careful way. If you minutely edit your English paper, you'll be sure to catch every last mistake.</li><li>A detective might investigate a crime minutely, examining every possible clue in an intent way. Minutely can also modify an adjective, as in a minutely detailed news report or a minutely precise dollhouse version of Buckingham Palace. At the root of minutely is the Latin minutus, ""little, small, or minute.""</li></ul>"
mirror,"<ul><li>A mirror is a glass surface backed with a metallic coating that reflects images that are in front of it. When you gaze at yourself in a mirror, your own face gazes right back at you.</li><li>""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?"" asks the evil queen in ""Snow White,"" as she admires her reflection. Ordinary mirrors can't answer this question, but they can show you how you look in your new hat or whether you have spinach between your teeth. And the verb mirror means ""reflect,"" as when the surface of a lake mirrors the sky.</li></ul>"
misconception,"<ul><li>A misconception is a conclusion that's wrong because it's based on faulty thinking or facts that are wrong. Your accusation about your brother's role in that unfortunate event at your party may be based on a misconception.</li><li>First appearing in the 1660s, the noun misconception comes from the prefix mis-, meaning ""bad, wrong,"" and the word conception, meaning ""act of conceiving."" A misconception usually results from incorrect thinking or a flawed understanding. Because they don't know the facts, many people have a misconception about how diseases such as AIDS are transmitted. It's a common misconception that Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, when, in fact, he didn't.</li></ul>"
misleading,
misunderstanding,"<ul><li>A misunderstanding is what happens when you don't comprehend something correctly. It's also another name for a disagreement, like the misunderstanding you and your sister had about whose turn it was to do the dishes.</li><li>The result of not clearly understanding someone or something is a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding between teammates can lead to dropped passes and lost points, and a misunderstanding of the pool rules can get you benched for doing a cannonball in the shallow end. You can also call a minor argument a misunderstanding.</li></ul>"
mock,"<ul><li>Imitation may be the most sincere form of flattery, but to mock is to make fun of or mimic someone with contempt, ridicule or derision. ""Louise’s favorite pastime was to mock her brother’s inability to sing on key.""</li><li>The verb mock — as in the use that inspired the name of the mockingbird — can be simple imitation but, more often, to mock someone is to show disdain through mimicry or parody.  As an adjective, mock indicates a fake or a simulation: ""The design team made the most fabulous mock Eiffel Tower for our staging of An American in Paris."" ""His mock gratitude was, at times, unbearable.""</li></ul>"
moderate,"<ul><li>A moderate voter is someone who is politically speaking, in the center. In other words, they are not quite left or right, but somewhere in the middle.</li><li>Moderate comes from the Latin for ""medium sized,"" and as a noun and an adjective it means ""middle, medium."" If you get moderate rainfall, it's not too much and not too little. Goldilocks was known for her moderate tastes. As a verb, it means ""to temper,"" or ""to reduce from the extreme."" If you moderate your speed while driving, you slow down a bit. If you moderate a discussion, you help two or more people have a reasonable conversation.</li></ul>"
mode,"<ul><li>You can describe the specific style of doing something as your mode.  If you're in vacation mode, for example, it might mean you say everything in a super-relaxed voice and spend all of your classes daydreaming.</li><li>From the Latin modus or ""manner,"" it has been popular since the 1400s.  Since the 1600s, people have been using it as another word for ""fashionable.""  The French term ""a la mode"" literally means ""in the fashion,"" or ""fashionable,"" but is more commonly used to describe as specific way of serving dessert (ice cream on the side).</li></ul>"
modest,"<ul><li>A person is modest if he or she is very successful but does not call attention to this.</li><li>Modest generally means ""big enough but not huge"" — like a modest house or a modest income. An ambitious person will not be satisfied with modest progress. Around the turn of the 17th century, modest referred to proper or decent dress and behavior especially in women. Although this is considered dated today, modest is still used for people who are shy about showing their body. If you are modest, you might wear your t-shirt when you swim.</li></ul>"
modestly,"<ul><li>To do something modestly is to do it in a humble way, without showing off. After her play's successful opening night, a playwright might choose to sit modestly in the audience rather than going on stage to bow.</li><li>When you act in an unpretentious way, you act modestly, and when you do something in the simplest way possible, you also do it modestly. The adjective modest can mean both ""humble"" and ""small."" Modesty and modest come from the Latin modestia, ""sense of honor,"" or ""correctness of conduct,"" from the root word modus, ""measure or manner.""</li></ul>"
modification,"<ul><li>A modification is a change or alteration, usually to make something work better.</li><li>If you want to change something — in other words, modify it — you need to make a modification. Lots of things require modification, because they get older or just because they can be improved. A car needs modification — in the form of snow tires — to be ready for the winter. Computer programs need modification all the time, because of new products or viruses. When you think of the word modification, think ""change.""</li></ul>"
modify,"<ul><li>To modify is to change or transform, but only slightly. If you miss your free-throws half the time, your coach will probably try to improve your shooting average by modifying your technique.</li><li>Modify may mean to alter something, but it's not a total makeover. When you modify or make modifications, you're making subtle changes. These tweaks are usually needed to make improvements or make the thing being modified less extreme. So you can modify your voice if your tone is too harsh, or modify your wardrobe with a few new pairs of cool shoes.</li></ul>"
momentous,"<ul><li>Momentous describes an important event or moment in time. It is used for a time of great consequence or for a major accomplishment, and is almost always reserved for good things.</li><li>When a moment is so great you know you'll never forget it, you have just experienced something momentous. It can be personal — perhaps the day you were named prom queen; or something historic — like the day Elizabeth was named Queen of England. Momentous and momentary share the root word moment but momentary describes just one fleeting moment in time. A momentary occurrence can certainly be momentous, but it's not always the case.</li></ul>"
monitor,"<ul><li>A monitor is a device or a person who watches or checks to see that all is going well. If you're babysitting, you might use a baby monitor so you can hear if the baby cries in its sleep.</li><li>Monitor can be used as a noun or a verb, both of which are concerned with watching over someone or something. A heart monitor displays the rhythm of your heart. A hall monitor is a person who checks to see that students aren't wandering the halls. If you are monitoring your grades, you are keeping track of them to see if they go up or down. And some parents buy a program that will monitor your Internet use, though you might think that this is an invasion of privacy.</li></ul>"
monopolize,"<ul><li>If you monopolize something, you won't let anyone else get their hands on it. When you were little, your mom might have said, ""Don't monopolize the swing. Let your sister have a turn.""</li><li>When a company monopolizes something, it has an unfair amount of control over a particular product or service, hurting other companies and giving consumers fewer choices. A business might monopolize the media in an entire state, for example, by owning the local newspapers, TV stations, and news websites. Monopolize comes from monopoly, which isn't just a great board game, but actually means ""exclusive control of a commodity or trade.""</li></ul>"
monopoly,"<ul><li>A monopoly is the exclusive ownership or control of something. If your sister claims a monopoly over the television during the Tom Cruise movie marathon, you would be wise not to touch that remote.</li><li>In economics, a monopoly specifically means the domination of a market by one owner or seller. Think of the board game Monopoly. You’re trying to own all the properties so that you have a monopoly over the board and the other players have to pay you basically anywhere they land. You might recognize the prefix mono, meaning “one."" Add it to the Greek word polein which means “sell,” and there you have it — one seller.</li></ul>"
monotone,"<ul><li>Monotone is a droning, unchanging tone. Nothing can put you to sleep quite as effectively as a teacher talking in a monotone.</li><li>The Greek word for ""one tone"" is monotonia, which is the root for both monotone and the closely-related word monotonous, which means ""dull and tedious."" A continuous sound, especially someone's voice, that doesn't rise and fall in pitch, is a monotone. When someone speaks in a monotone, his voice is flat and boring — plus listeners don't know how the speaker is feeling when everything sounds the same.</li></ul>"
monotonous,"<ul><li>When something goes on and on and on and on and on, the same way, for a long time, that's monotonous. Monotonous things are boring and repetitive, like that long story you've heard your brother tell a hundred times before.</li><li>Ever hear a song that just sounds like the same thing over and over? Ever hear a dog that keeps barking all day? Or a voice that's dull and unchanging in tone? All those things are monotonous: they don't change much, and they're dull as dishwater. Anything tedious or humdrum is probably monotonous. If someone says you're being monotonous, try to vary your tone of voice or the things you're talking about.</li></ul>"
monumental,"<ul><li>Whether it's a monumental effort requiring vast amounts of strength or a monumental cruise ship with eleven floors and five sets of elevators, the word monumental describes something imposing or massive in size.</li><li>Monumental can also refer to something that's of outstanding importance or significance. A monumental decision for you would be one that changes your life — like the day you got engaged or when you decided to move to New York to be an actor. The word monumental can also be used if you're talking about a monument, a statue or structure commemorating a person or event. You might admire the monumental stonework on the statue in the town square.</li></ul>"
moreover,"<ul><li>Use the adverb moreover to add information that supports what’s already been said. You have to go shopping on Saturday to buy new tube socks, and moreover, you need to get a birthday present for your mom.</li><li>Breaking moreover into more and over helps you remember what it means: more information over what has already been said. When you hear someone use moreover that tips you off that whatever follows is going to relate to what came before. You can think of moreover as a formal way of saying besides. You may be sick of your brother always getting out of doing the chores, and, moreover, the guy has a really bad attitude about taking on responsibility.</li></ul>"
motif,"<ul><li>The race car decor in your room, the refrain of a song, the idea or object that keeps popping up in a story — these are all motifs, reoccurring elements that move throughout and shape music, art and novels.</li><li>This French import is related to the Latin verb movere which means ""to move."" Think about a pattern or design that moves throughout something when you hear motif. Have you ever been to a restaurant with a tropical or Wild West motif? Do you like dresses with a floral motif? In novels, a motif can be a recurring idea like revenge or an object that symbolizes an idea. A character might notice shadows throughout a story which symbolize his dark past.</li></ul>"
mount,"<ul><li>To mount is to climb up something, like a ladder, or get on the back of something, like a horse. You can also mount something on another object, like a camera on a tripod or a sticker on a notebook.</li><li>The word mountain can help you remember that one way to mount is to climb. You can mount a mountain or a flight of stairs. You can also mount a pony by getting on its back or a bicycle by climbing onto it. The oldest meaning of mount is, in fact, ""mountain,"" from the Old French word mont, which has its root in the Latin montem for “mountain.""</li></ul>"
mundane,"<ul><li>An ordinary, unexciting thing can be called mundane: ""Superman hid his heroic feats by posing as his mundane alter ego, Clark Kent.""</li><li>Mundane, from the Latin word mundus, ""world,"" originally referred to things on earth. Such things were supposed to be uninteresting when compared to the delights of Heaven; hence the word's present meaning. Writing about reality TV shows, a Newsweek writer opined, ""In reality bizarro-world, the mundane is presented as the spectacular"" — in other words, people's everyday routines are now televised as entertainment.</li></ul>"
mutually exclusive,"<ul><li>Two things that can't happen at the same time, or that completely contradict each other, are mutually exclusive. If you tell your dad you want to go hiking and see a movie on Saturday, he might tell you those are mutually exclusive choices: you can pick only one.</li><li>You could say that war and peace are mutually exclusive, since by definition peace includes the absence of war or fighting. Some things that seem like they're mutually exclusive (like sunshine and rain) aren't really — it's possible for it to rain when the sun is shining. In math and statistics, there are numerous examples of things that are mutually exclusive, and even formulas for determining whether or not they are.</li></ul>"
myriad,"<ul><li>A myriad is a lot of something. If you’re talking about Ancient Greece, a myriad is ten thousand, but today you can use the word in myriad other ways.</li><li>Myriad comes from the Greek myrioi, the word for ten thousand, or less specifically, a countless amount. Myriad can be a noun, like a myriad of choices, or an adjective, like when you study myriad subjects in college. If you lift a rock you might find a myriad of bugs. Sticklers often look down their noses at using myriad as a noun, but that usage came first.</li></ul>"
mysteriously,"<ul><li>If something occurs in a strange or eerie way, you can say it happens mysteriously. Your little brother might mysteriously disappear every time the dog needs to be walked, for example.</li><li>When something can't be easily explained, it happens mysteriously. Some people say that boats mysteriously disappear in a region of the Atlantic Ocean known as the Bermuda Triangle, and others tell stories of sick people being mysteriously healed by prayer. At the heart of mysteriously is the noun mystery, which had only a religious meaning until the late fourteenth century, and which is rooted in the the Greek word mysterion, ""secret rite or doctrine.""</li></ul>"
narrow,"<ul><li>Narrow means less wide or to make less wide. When you narrow down your choices, you decrease the number of choices. A road might be too narrow for a car.</li><li>When used to describe something physical such as a street or hips, narrow simply means not wide. Similarly, with quantities it means not much like when you win your basketball game by a narrow margin. But if you use it to describe an attitude, it has the negative meaning of not wide or open enough. If you're narrow-minded, you don't see the big picture –– sometimes it means you think in narrow stereotypes.</li></ul>"
nature,"<ul><li>Your nature is sort of the way you are — the sum total of how you think, feel, and behave. It might be in your nature to remain calm and level-headed when faced with a difficult challenge.</li><li>Things that aren't people can also have their own nature. You might notice the frantic nature of a political debate, or you might question the nature of your brother's friendships. Nature can also refer to the physical world made up of plants and animals: what you think of as ""the great outdoors."" You might be a nature lover who enjoys hiking. Nature can also describe natural forces, such as the destructive elements of nature, like a tsunami or a tornado.</li></ul>"
nearly,"<ul><li>When something nearly happens, it comes very close to occurring, but doesn't. Nearly is a useful adverb for describing things that are almost accomplished.</li><li>If you and your brother nearly win the three-legged race, you lose by a matter of seconds. And, if you nearly drop your dog's leash at a busy intersection, your heart might pound from the closeness of your best pal's brush with danger. An interesting detail about nearly is that it nearly ended up with a different meaning: until the late 1600s, in fact, it meant ""carefully.""</li></ul>"
necessary,"<ul><li>Everyone can agree that certain things are necessary for survival: food, water, shelter. Some people might add chocolate to that list. Necessary refers to anything you can't do without.</li><li>Necessary, cede, and cease all come from the same root, cedere, which is Latin for ""to go away"" or ""to give something up.""  When something's necessary, you won't give it up. That fudge-covered brownie sundae from your favorite ice-cream shop? It might seem like a decadent treat, but if you're a true chocolate lover you'll insist that it's as necessary as a warm jacket in winter.</li></ul>"
needless to say,
nevertheless,"<ul><li>A funny-looking adverb that appears to be made up of three words squished together, nevertheless means “even so"" or ""all the same.”</li><li>It’s likely that nevertheless evolved from the Middle English neverthelater, a word with the same sense of “despite anything to the contrary” and “notwithstanding.”  You might say of your siblings, ""Sure we bicker and get sick of each other sometimes. Nevertheless, they’re family and I love them.""</li></ul>"
nocturnal,"<ul><li>If something is nocturnal, it belongs to or is active at night. That includes vampires, owls that like to hunt by moonlight, and that roommate who stays up playing video games until the wee hours of the morning.</li><li>The adjective nocturnal comes from the Late Latin nocturnalis, which means “belonging to the night."" You've probably heard of nocturnal animals, like bats and fireflies, who sleep during the day and come out to play when the sun goes down. The opposite of nocturnal is diurnal, meaning active during the daytime — but you probably won't be using that word much unless you're a zoologist.</li></ul>"
notable,"<ul><li>When something is notable, it's worthy of notice, or even famous. It might be a notable feature of your trip to New York City that you spotted one of the city's notable celebrities.</li><li>Notable is a very useful word — it allows you succinctly to note that from a long list of things you could say, you have thoughtfully picked out only the ones that are the most notable, the most worthy — a notable example of kindness to your listeners.</li></ul>"
notably,"<ul><li>The word notably singles people and things out as special. A notably brilliant scientist is especially brilliant, so you might want to take notes when she speaks!</li><li>Things that are described as notably are remarkable or striking in some way. A notably excellent painter is a great painter. A notably mean professor is one students will want to avoid, because that professor is really mean. A notably fast car is especially fast. This word is a type of intensifier, a notably strong intensifier.</li></ul>"
note,"<ul><li>A note is a very short piece of writing. You might write a note to your sister on the back of your grocery list, or jot down a quick note reminding yourself to call your grandmother later.</li><li>You might slip a love note under a door, or leave your cat sitter a note explaining how much to feed Fluffy. Other notes are taken during lectures or written in notebooks by journalists during interviews. You can also make a mental note, paying particular attention to something in the hopes that you'll remember it later. The Old French noter, ""indicate or write down,"" comes from the Latin root notare, ""to mark or note,"" from nota, ""mark.""</li></ul>"
noticeable,"<ul><li>Something that is noticeable is apparent or easy to be noticed. If the change in your report cards is noticeable, let's hope it’s because your grades went up!</li><li>It’s easy to remember noticeable, by thinking of it as able to be noticed. Noticeable also means deserving of being noticed, or notable, like good manners or good work habits. Other noticeable things are just easy to spot, and not always in a good way. That piece of spinach between your teeth the entire time you were having lunch with your boss? “Don’t worry; it was hardly noticeable.""</li></ul>"
notion,"<ul><li>If you have a notion that you can swim across the ocean, you are probably wrong. A notion is an idea, often vague and sometimes fanciful.</li><li>A notion is lighter than a theory and embraces a whimsy that a simple idea never could. You might have the notion that you can slow global warming by taking public transportation and reusing plastic bags. If you share a far-fetched idea with others, someone might respond with a ""Where'd you get that notion?!"" Notions can also refer to the buttons, thread, zippers, and pins necessary for sewing things. So if you have a notion to create your own Halloween costume, you better pick up some notions from the craft store.</li></ul>"
notwithstanding,"<ul><li>Notwithstanding means ""in spite of something."" Your boasts about having memorized the entire textbook and bribing the teacher with apples notwithstanding, you still managed to fail the final exam with flying colors.</li><li>You don't have to look too closely at the word to be able to break it into three parts: not- + withstand (to successfully oppose or resist) + the participial ending -ing. In the most literal sense, notwithstanding actually means to successfully oppose or resist. Top-of-the-line wet-traction tires notwithstanding, the car still got stuck in the mud. Notwithstanding works just as well in a more figurative context. His reputation for charm and tact notwithstanding, he offended everyone in the room.</li></ul>"
novel,"<ul><li>If something is so new and original that it's never been seen, used or even thought of before, call it novel. The noun novel describes a book-length work of fiction.</li><li>New and novel come from the same Indo-European root but by different paths. Whereas new is a Germanic word coming from Old English, novel is based on Latin novellus ""new, young, fresh."" If something is novel, it is new but also original, fresh and unique. Companies are always looking for that novel idea that will earn them millions and skydiving is a novel experience, especially if you're not adventurous.</li></ul>"
now and then,"<ul><li>Something that happens now and then occurs every once in a while. You call your grandma every single week, but your sibling only talks to her now and then.</li><li>You can use the phrase now and then for things you do occasionally or every so often. If your family almost always eats pizza on Friday night but sometimes orders Thai food instead, that means you get to eat your favorite pad Thai now and then. Now and then has been used this way since at least the 1550s — before that, people said then and then instead.</li></ul>"
objective,"<ul><li>An objective is something you plan to achieve. A military objective is the overall plan for a mission. The objective for a bake sale is to raise money. If your objective is to learn a new word, you have succeeded.</li><li>An objective is the point of something. If you don’t understand the objective of a class, then you don’t know what you were supposed to learn. The word itself is often used in business or work. Another meaning of objective is “looking at things in a detached, impartial, fact-based way.” If a police officer falls in love with a witness, it might be hard for her to stay objective. The word comes from the Latin ob ""against"" + jacere ""to throw.”</li></ul>"
oblige,"<ul><li>To oblige is to do something you have to, because you're bound by either good manners or the law.</li><li>You are obliged to pay back your student loans, or for your portion of the dinner bill. You may also feel obliged to bring a gift if you're invited to a wedding. You can also tip your cowboy hat and be ""much obliged"" if someone does you a favor. The French phrase, noblesse oblige means basically that ""privilege entails responsibility,"" or that the wealthy are obliged to do something productive in the world and not just sit around polishing their silver spoons.</li></ul>"
obscure,"<ul><li>If something is obscure, it's vague and hard to see. Be careful if you're driving in heavy rain — the painted lines can be obscure.</li><li>Obscure comes from Latin obscurus, which can mean ""dark, dim,"" ""unclear, hard to understand,"" or ""insignificant, humble."" We tend to use obscure in the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and probably insignificant. Obscure can also be used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a debate, your embarrassing twitches and shaking hands can obscure your argument.</li></ul>"
obscure,"<ul><li>If something is obscure, it's vague and hard to see. Be careful if you're driving in heavy rain — the painted lines can be obscure.</li><li>Obscure comes from Latin obscurus, which can mean ""dark, dim,"" ""unclear, hard to understand,"" or ""insignificant, humble."" We tend to use obscure in the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and probably insignificant. Obscure can also be used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a debate, your embarrassing twitches and shaking hands can obscure your argument.</li></ul>"
obtain,"<ul><li>Obtain means to get something that is not so easy to come by such as knowledge, rights, or a large amount of money. You wouldn't say you obtained a pair of pants, unless they were one of a kind.</li><li>At times in its history, obtain has meant to be victorious or to succeed. Today, it mostly means to acquire, but keeping its prior meanings in mind helps you to use it in the right way. College degrees are something that you obtain as is permission from your parents to go to a party. When you obtain something, you have worked hard to get it, so you are pretty happy to have it.</li></ul>"
obvious,"<ul><li>Something obvious is plain to see and easily understandable. It was obvious that you didn't enjoy your meal because I found it rolled in a napkin and shoved under the rug.</li><li>There's nothing vague about the adjective obvious — it's right there in front of your eyes! It describes something that's easy to figure out or the most straightforward option. If someone states the obvious, you're likely to respond with a sarcastic ""No duh!"" or ""Thanks Sherlock."" If obvious isn't the obvious word of choice, you can try a synonym such as ""evident"" or ""apparent.""</li></ul>"
obviously,"<ul><li>Something obviously true is clearly, totally, unmistakably true. There's just no doubt about it.</li><li>Obviously is a word people use when they are sure of something and sure that it's plainly clear to others. When you get presents on your birthday, you're obviously happy. Dogs obviously like to chase squirrels. The sky is obviously blue. People also use this word when they're being mean or sarcastic. If you didn't know who walked on the moon, a friend might say, ""Obviously, it was Neil Armstrong!""</li></ul>"
occasion,"<ul><li>Occasion means something special––that happens seldom or is notable when it does. On occasion, we sit down together as a family, but not every day, and never for dinner. When Great Aunt Mabel visits, however, we rise to the occasion and stage a large family meal.</li><li>Occasion can also mean a designated time or reason something happens, or it can be an event in itself.  I'm giving you your grandmother's ring on the occasion of your graduation from high school. I haven't had occasion to look at it since she died. It's valuable, so only wear it on special occasions.</li></ul>"
occasionally,"<ul><li>Something that happens occasionally doesn't happen all the time, just every once in a while.  You play poker occasionally just to remind yourself that you always lose.</li><li>The adverb occasionally is good for things that happen every now and then. You get tired of the cold occasionally, but the snow is lovely.  Occasionally, you think of your long lost love, but never write.  The idea comes to you occasionally that you should move somewhere with more people and warmer weather.  I worry about you occasionally.</li></ul>"
likelihood,"<ul><li>The likelihood of something means the odds that it will happen, or how likely a particular outcome is. Your likelihood of winning the lottery is pretty slim.</li><li>If you figured out the likelihood of winning the lottery before you bought a scratch ticket, you might end up spending your money on something else. Likelihood indicates probability or chance. The likelihood that you'll convince your stubborn dog to get in your car completely depends on how many dog treats you've got in your pocket.</li></ul>"
offset,"<ul><li>When you offset something—say, the price of gas—you find a way to make up for it. My new car's ability to get fifty miles per gallon offset the rise in the price of gas. Offset functions as both a noun and a verb.</li><li>Okay, let's talk turkey. The Duke's lack of height was offset by his enormous wig. Even without shoes, he towered above most people, because his wig alone was five feet tall. The cost of the wig—close to $10,000—was easily offset by its quality: it was worth every cent. The inconvenience of the blizzard was offset by the joy of not having to go to school or work—or even get out of bed. The joy was what you might call an offset.</li></ul>"
old male,
omit,"<ul><li>If you omit one member of the class when you're handing out valentines, it's going to make that person feel terrible. To omit something is to leave it out, to forget or overlook it.</li><li>The verb omit comes from the Latin word omittere, ""to let go or to lay aside,"" which is exactly what it means. When you omit an ingredient you need for your brownie recipe from the grocery list, you've accidentally left off an important item. You can also deliberately omit something, which you'd do if you didn't include your least favorite cousin when you invited your relatives to a family reunion.</li></ul>"
on the contrary,
on the whole,
ongoing,"<ul><li>If something is ongoing, it is happening now. If you have an ongoing argument with your neighbor, it means you were arguing before, you’re arguing now, and it looks like you'll be arguing into the future.</li><li>If something is ongoing, it is currently in action. Often in news reports, reference will be made to an ongoing investigation because the police are in the midst of it at the moment of reporting. Ongoing reports are currently in progress as are ongoing repairs. If your teachers say that there will be ongoing testing throughout the year, you won't be done with it until you get out of school.</li></ul>"
onset,"<ul><li>When something is at its onset, it's at the beginning, just getting started, and it's often something that's not so pleasant. The onset of hurricane season is probably not the best time to visit the beach.</li><li>If you catch an infection right at the onset and treat it immediately, the infection may not last so long. You can also have an early onset of something, and that usually means something you'd rather not have at all, as with early-onset Alzheimer's, a disease that usually appears after age 65. If you begin showing signs of the disease at a younger age than usual, you're said to have early-onset Alzheimer's.</li></ul>"
optimal,"<ul><li>Something that's optimal is the best or most favorable for a given situation. Flowers? Check. Chocolates? Check. Dinner reservation? Check. Sounds like you have the optimal conditions for a successful anniversary date.</li><li>There's an implication with optimal that certain restrictions exist in a given situation, so that what is optimal isn't necessarily the ideal scenario — it's the best one given those limitations. For example, optimal population levels for a species are not the highest levels — instead they're the best levels that a particular environment can sustain. Often the word optimum is used interchangeably with optimal.</li></ul>"
option,"<ul><li>An option is a possibility or choice. In football, a quarterback with three wide receivers has (at least) three throwing options.</li><li>An option is something that can be chosen — it's a possibility. Even something crazy — like jumping off a cliff — is always an option, just not a good one. There are lots of technical uses of option in business and legal writing. If you have the option on a house, you have the right to buy it. In sports, a free agent has the option of joining another team. No matter what you do, it's nice to have options. When we have no options, we feel trapped.</li></ul>"
orchestrate,"<ul><li>To orchestrate is to design or organize something, like a plan or a project. You could orchestrate an orchestra or you could just orchestrate a yard sale.</li><li>An orchestra is a large group of classical musicians led by a conductor: it consists of many people playing together. Similarly, when we talk about orchestrating, someone is coordinating the activities of many people to accomplish something. The manager of an office orchestrates the business. A coach orchestrates the play of the team. Terrorist leaders orchestrate attacks. Orchestrating is like directing, and it applies to many more things than just music.</li></ul>"
orientation,"<ul><li>Orientation is all about the direction you're facing. A house can have an east-facing orientation. Freshman orientation starts you off in a good direction. Your political orientation means your political outlook.</li><li>Orientation is a relatively new word that was derived in the 19th century from orient, which means to point yourself in a specific direction. Hiking with a map and a compass is sometimes called orienteering, referring to hikers' use of those tools to orient themselves.</li></ul>"
originally,
originate,"<ul><li>Originate is a verb that means to start or create something. You can originate the idea of adding a fancy new coffee machine to your company's break room, and before long, your entire office could be happily drinking mocha lattes.</li><li>Originate is the place or point at which any new thing or idea starts. It usually doesn't end there, though. A carpet that originates in Turkey can travel all the way to an apartment in New York. A rumor can originate during first period, but by lunchtime it will have made its way around the entire high school.</li></ul>"
ornament,"<ul><li>An ornament is a decoration. You can also ornament something by making it more beautiful or festive.</li><li>The most common use of ornament is probably in Christmas ornaments, which decorate a tree. Similarly, any ornament makes something prettier, flashier, or more festive. When you ornament something, you're beautifying, embellishing, or adorning it. Women ornament themselves with makeup. Men ornament themselves with face paint at football games. People ornament their offices with pictures of their families. Different cultures have their own ways of ornamenting themselves and their homes. If something looks boring, why not ornament it?</li></ul>"
ornamental,"<ul><li>If something is ornamental, it's a decoration. The red feather in your cap is most definitely ornamental; it serves no purpose other than providing a splash of color.</li><li>Ornamental things are, by definition, just for show — they're not actually useful. So an ornamental pond in your yard might be pretty, but you can't fish or swim in it, and an ornamental telephone booth in your friend's living room doesn't really work. Likewise, ornamental plants or gardens are full of beautiful flowers and foliage, but nothing in them is edible.</li></ul>"
ornamentation,"<ul><li>Ornamentation can refer to materials or features used for decoration. The ornamentation in a fancy mansion might include crystal chandeliers, silk curtains, and thick carpets.</li><li>In addition to referring to materials for decoration, ornamentation can also mean the act of decorating or the state of being decorated. If your friend is constantly redecorating her room in extravagant ways, she probably enjoys the process of ornamentation. A heavily decorated house is in a state of ornamentation. However it’s used, ornamentation involves making things look prettier — or at least more elaborate. A single object used for ornamentation can be called an ornament.</li></ul>"
ostentatious,"<ul><li>Reach for the adjective ostentatious when you want a flashy way to say — well, ""flashy"" or ""showy.""</li><li>No one wants to be described as ostentatious, a word whose cousins include pretentious, flamboyant, and gaudy. It originates from the Latin word ostentare, ""to display,"" but in English it's often used for displays of the crass or vulgar sort. A rapper's diamond-encrusted teeth might be an ostentatious display of ""bling,"" and someone wailing especially loudly at a funeral of a distant acquaintance might be making an ostentatious show of sorrow.</li></ul>"
outbreak,"<ul><li>A sudden or abrupt onset of something really bad is an outbreak. You could experience an outbreak of measles or an outbreak of violence; either way, try to protect yourself.</li><li>When you talk about an outbreak of something, it's almost always something terrible, or at least unwanted. You might hear about an outbreak of war in a distant country, or an outbreak of violence in a big city, or an outbreak of disease among farm animals. Outbreak started as a Middle English verb around 1300, becoming a noun meaning ""eruption"" about three hundred years later.</li></ul>"
outcome,"<ul><li>The result of something, or the consequence of it, is the outcome. If your oldest child announces that your youngest child has climbed onto the roof with a handmade set of wings, you should probably not expect a good outcome. Better run!</li><li>The noun outcome refers to the result of a process, but recently, when joined with the word ""based"", it has become jargon within a variety of industries and you'll see uses like outcome-based medicine and outcome-based budgeting. Outcome-based education, for example, rewards schools and teachers whose students meet certain goals on standardized tests, although critics argue this robs teachers and students of creativity.</li></ul>"
outermost,
overlook,"<ul><li>To overlook something is to fail to see it. When planning a party, it's best to write out a to-do list so that you don't overlook any details.</li><li>The verb overlook literally means to look over the top of. The word has come to refer to the act of neglecting something, usually because your focus is aimed elsewhere. You might overlook the cost of car insurance if you’re busy calculating the cost of buying the car and paying for gas and parking. As a noun, an overlook is a space high above ground. You might overlook your curfew if you're busy enjoying an overlook with your date.</li></ul>"
overview,"<ul><li>An overview is a general summary of something. An overview gives the big picture, while leaving out the minor details.</li><li>If you take a class on American history, the class will be an overview: it will sum up the most important events that have happened, such as famous elections, national disasters, major wars, and economic trends. When writing an overview, you have to leave out a lot of details, because you're focusing on major points. You can give an overview of a company's business, of a sport team's season, or even of your own life.</li></ul>"
overwhelming,"<ul><li>Something overwhelming is very intense and hard to deal with: overwhelming events make people worried and stressed out.</li><li>It's hard to overcome overwhelming things. If you feel an overwhelming need to laugh, you're probably going to laugh. If you have an overwhelming feeling of sadness, you'll probably cry. An overwhelming amount of homework is almost impossible to get done. Adults who work, have families, and struggle to pay the bills feel like their lives are overwhelming.  A tornado or hurricane is an overwhelming force of nature. When something is overwhelming, there's not much you can do against it.</li></ul>"
owing to,
pace,"<ul><li>Pace is how fast something travels a particular distance, like a runner who tries to achieve a consistent pace, running each mile in more or less the same amount of time.</li><li>Pace comes from the Latin word passus, meaning “a step.” Pace is a noun, meaning ""the speed at which something happens."" Some say city life has a faster pace because everyone hurries and there are so many exciting things to do. Pace is also a verb — if you pace yourself, you’ll have enough energy to experience all of that city's sights, from the rush of rush hour to the late-night party scene.</li></ul>"
pacify,"<ul><li>If you are bringing peace or calm to a state of unrest, you are pacifying the situation. Just think of the transformation a squalling baby undergoes when a pacifier is placed within his mouth, and you will remember the power of the verb to pacify.</li><li>If you work to establish peace in a certain location between factions at war, then you are working to pacify a country or region. The U.N. has specially trained workers, called peace keepers, who go into to trouble spots to try to pacify rebellions factions and restore order. Or, one can pacify a disgruntled crowd: ""The store manager attempted to pacify the restless crowd of shoppers by promising the popular out-of-stock item would soon be back on the shelves.""</li></ul>"
paradox,"<ul><li>Here's a mind-bender: ""This statement is false."" If you think it's true, then it must be false, but if you think it's false, it must be true. Now that's a paradox!</li><li>A paradox is a logical puzzler that contradicts itself in a baffling way. ""This statement is false"" is a classic example, known to logicians as ""the liar's paradox."" Paradoxical statements may seem completely self-contradictory, but they can be used to reveal deeper truths. When Oscar Wilde said, ""I can resist anything except temptation,"" he used a paradox to highlight how easily we give in to tempting things while imagining that we can hold firm and resist them.</li></ul>"
paradoxically,
parcel out,
pare,"<ul><li>To pare is to trim — like when you pare branches on a tree or pare down your expenses to save money.</li><li>Pare comes from the Latin word parare, meaning ""to prepare.""  Think of peeling potatoes, which you might do with a paring knife, or paring your nails so you'll make a neat appearance. In each case, you are trimming something gradually. If you pare down your expectations, you might be pleasantly surprised.</li></ul>"
particularly,"<ul><li>The adverb form of ""particular,"" the word particularly means ""in a focused, precise manner."" You looked for stones that had the proper qualities, particularly rounded edges and elongated shapes.  Careful near the windows.</li><li>The idea of particularly hails from the Lower Latin particularis, which meant ""a particle,"" and in English took on the idea of something ""pertaining to a single thing or person.""  Later, the word was refined to take on the idea of an exactness of detail.  Journalist Ambrose Bierce applied the word as emphasis to his definition of incompatibility: ""In matrimony a similarity of tastes, particularly the taste for domination.""</li></ul>"
partly,
patch,"<ul><li>When you patch something, you repair it, like when you patch a hole in the knee of your favorite jeans or when road crews use asphalt to patch a pothole in the street.</li><li>The verb patch describes fixing by filling in a weak spot or by replacing missing material. You might patch a wall, for example, to fill in a hole before you paint it, or even “patch things up” after a disagreement with a friend. As a noun, patch describes a period of time, like a ""rough path,"" the material used for fixing, like the patch you sew over a hole in fabric, or even a small piece of land, like a garden patch.</li></ul>"
peak,"<ul><li>Use the word peak to refer to the pointy top of something, such as the jagged peak of a tall mountain or the tapered peak that forms when you beat egg whites for a recipe.</li><li>Peak is one of those words that can play a variety of roles in a sentence. The noun peak can refer to something that is a literal highpoint, like that snow-covered peak over there in the distance, but you will also hear it used to refer to more abstract high points, such as a time of greatest success (""at the peak of your career"") or top performance (""the stock price reached a peak over the summer"") or highest level (""the peak of the flu season""). The word also has a verb form (""Don’t peak too soon"") and an adjective form (""peak productivity"") that carry similar meanings.</li></ul>"
peculiar,"<ul><li>Something peculiar is notably unusual. If your friend starts saying strange things you don't understand, ask her why she's suddenly become peculiar.</li><li>Peculiar comes from the Latin peculiaris, meaning one's own, or personal.  In English, it originally meant belonging to one person, private, like your fondness for your peculiar hairbrush.  It also had the meaning of something unlike others, special, or remarkable. Eventually we mostly stopped using it for belongings,  instead using peculiar to mean unusual or odd.</li></ul>"
penetrate,"<ul><li>To penetrate is to force into or pierce through. If the fog is thick as pea soup, your flashlight won’t penetrate it. If you stubbornly ignore good advice, people might say nothing can penetrate that thick skull of yours.</li><li>We get penetrate from the Latin word penetrare, which combines penes (""within"") and intrare (""to enter""). Penetrate crops up most often to describe entering or permeating. Blaring music penetrated every corner of the dorm and we wondered how anyone could study with that racket. Penetrate can also mean to decipher or understand: ""Careful study allowed us to penetrate the mysteries of Pig Latin."" Finally — no surprise, given its Latin roots — the word can be used to describe sexual intercourse.</li></ul>"
perceptible,"<ul><li>Something perceptible is noticeable, even if just slightly. A perceptible noise can be heard.</li><li>You perceive through your senses, and things that are perceptible can be perceived; you can sense them. A flavor is perceptible if you can taste it. A sound is perceptible if you can hear it. The opposite of perceptible is imperceptible, for things that can't be noticed or detected. If you notice a sound, sight, or change, then it must be perceptible.</li></ul>"
peril,"<ul><li>If you realize mid-climb that your rock climbing rope is frayed, you might be in peril. The word peril means imminent danger to life and limb.</li><li>Peril comes from the Latin peric(u)lum, meaning danger. Today it's often used in tandem with the word mortal, which relates to death. For example, you're in mortal peril when you're flying down a cliff-side trail on your mountain bike and you hit loose gravel. Peril can also describe dangers of a less physical sort, though it's less common. If your employer sinks your 401K into what turns out to be a Ponzi scheme, he's put your retirement in peril.</li></ul>"
perilous,"<ul><li>Something that is dangerous or very risky can be described with the adjective perilous. If you are driving in a blizzard, you may kick yourself for making such a perilous journey.</li><li>The adjective perilous comes from the Latin word periculum, meaning dangerous. Words from the same root include peril, a noun meaning a dangerous situation, and imperil, a verb meaning to put in danger. The last thing you want to do as a parent is to imperil your children. Unfortunately, childhood is filled with peril — from climbing on the monkey bars to eating paste, dirt, or bugs. If you think you can prevent all perilous situations, you haven't been a parent very long!</li></ul>"
periodically,"<ul><li>When you do something periodically, you do it either occasionally or at regular intervals. Do you talk to your grandmother once every week or two? Then you can say you call her periodically.</li><li>It's easy to get to the bottom of periodically by looking at the word period, in its sense of ""course or extent of time."" When things happen periodically, they occur after a period of time has passed, either a random length of time or a more regular interval: ""That bird shows up at my window periodically"" or ""He periodically opens and closes the blinds just as the sun rises and sets.""</li></ul>"
perishable,"<ul><li>Something perishable is likely to die or decay. A perishable is also a type of food with a limited shelf life if it's not refrigerated.</li><li>Since perishing is dying, anything perishable could die or is likely to die. Unfortunately, people are perishable and most things in the world are too. Nothing lasts forever. A perishable is also a type of food that will go bad quickly if you leave it out of the fridge. Milk is a perishable, and so are yogurt and ice cream. Whether you're talking about a perishable or something perishable, this word refers to something that just won't last.</li></ul>"
permanent,"<ul><li>Something that’s permanent is constant and lasting, as opposed to temporary. Think twice about writing in permanent marker or getting a tattoo — both are just about impossible to erase.</li><li>If you wait around for something permanent to change, you'll be there for a long time — maybe forever. That's because the adjective permanent is used to describe something that continues on into the foreseeable future without shifting, moving, or changing at all. You might also come across the noun permanent, which refers to a chemical treatment used to curl your hair. But please know that ""perms"" aren't really cool anymore.</li></ul>"
permeate,"<ul><li>When you live in a big city like New York, you know all too well how the smells of spices and cooking meats can permeate a hallway, easily passing through those thin apartment doors to make your mouth water.</li><li>The verb permeate literally means to ""pass through."" It's often used to describe smells or liquids that not only pass through, but also spread to fill an entire area. When you bake cookies, you'll notice that the rich, sweet smell of those cookies isn't confined just to your oven — it permeates the entire kitchen and even the whole house. In science class, you might have learned about a permeable membrane — a thin material that is porous enough to let liquids or gases to pass through.</li></ul>"
permit,"<ul><li>Permit means to allow. When you permit your brother to come into your room, you let him in. (You can always kick him back out if he messes with your stuff.)</li><li>To permit means to let someone do something. It comes from the Latin permittere which means ""give up, allow to pass through."" You might feel like you ""gave up"" when you permitted your brother to enter your room. As a noun, a permit is a document that lets you do something — like when you get a driver's permit to learn to drive, or a gun permit to carry a gun, or even a construction permit to build an addition to your house.</li></ul>"
perpetual,"<ul><li>Use the adjective perpetual to describe something that never ends or changes. If you're a perpetual procrastinator, your dilly-dallying ways are never going to improve.</li><li>It may be true that the only constant is change, but English nevertheless has no shortage of words to describe things that never change: everlasting, eternal, and permanent, for example — and this word, perpetual, from the Latin perpetuus, ""continuous."" In casual usage, though, you might hear someone say ""This perpetual bad weather needs to clear."" Maybe it should come as no surprise to find people using the word to describe things that are not truly everlasting — since so few things really are.</li></ul>"
perpetuate,"<ul><li>Some things should last forever and others should not be perpetuated at all. Things that should NOT be perpetuated? Ugly rumors, arms races, and your Aunt Martha's annual fruit cake.</li><li>Be careful not to confuse perpetuate with perpetrate. Although they differ in spelling by only one letter, they differ greatly in meaning. If you perpetuate something, you help it last. Perpetrate, on the other hand, means to commit a criminal act. Needless to say, you wouldn't want to perpetuate the acts of perpetrators!</li></ul>"
persist,"<ul><li>When someone persists they keep going or hang on. If you want to finish a marathon, you have to persist and keep running, no matter how many blisters you have.</li><li>The great Roman poet Ovid once advised: “Endure and persist, this pain will turn good by and by.” As Ovid’s quote hints at, persistence is often associated with hardship and the reward that comes with not backing down. Synonyms include endure, follow through, and persevere, while antonyms include cease and give up.</li></ul>"
persistence,"<ul><li>Persistence is the ability to stick with something. If you practice the violin for over a year in order to play ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" perfectly, that's persistence!</li><li>Persistence can also mean something that lasts for a very long time. The persistence of bullying, despite years of efforts by the school, has frustrated many parents. Bed bugs are known for their persistence. Despite near eradication in the 1950s, they are back and harder to eliminate than ever.</li></ul>"
personality,"<ul><li>Your personality is what makes you ""you"" — the combination of characteristics that make you unique.</li><li>Despite sharing some of the same genes, your siblings may have different personalities from you. You may be outgoing and upbeat, your sister may be quiet and reserved, and your brother may be a perennial pessimist. A personality can also refer to someone who is well known in a certain field — such as a sports or television personality.</li></ul>"
pertinent,"<ul><li>Something pertinent is relevant and on-point. If you give your best friend pertinent advice, that means the advice is appropriate for the situation.</li><li>Something pertinent is related to the current topic or situation — and probably helpful too. If you're in math class and you make a comment about World War I, that's likely not pertinent. If you're in music class and you talk about a cello, that probably is pertinent. Pertinent things are appropriate and logical. In most situations, people like to get comments and questions that are pertinent — anything else can just seem like a distraction.</li></ul>"
pervasive,"<ul><li>When something is pervasive, it's everywhere. Common things are pervasive — like greed and cheap perfume.</li><li>Ever notice how certain trends seem to spread all over the place? When something — like a hairstyle — is super-common, it's pervasive. Pervasive things can't be escaped. Playing video games is pervasive among kids. Talking about the weather is pervasive among adults. Ideas, diseases, habits, and all sorts of things can be pervasive. If you're sick of seeing something because you're seeing it again and again, it must be pervasive.</li></ul>"
phenomena,
phenomenal,"<ul><li>If you think something is amazing, astounding, or marvelous, you can also call it phenomenal. Your dog's phenomenal performance at the agilty competition earned her a blue ribbon — and a handful of biscuits.</li><li>Phenomenal things aren't just cool — they're truly remarkable and possibly even unique. Your sister's campaign to raise money for cancer research, which amassed a million dollars in two weeks? That's phenomenal. And Serena Williams, having won an unprecedented 23 Grand Slam titles, is without question a phenomenal tennis player. This extraordinary word comes from the relatively ordinary Greek phainomenon, ""appearance,"" and its Proto-Indo-European root bha-, ""to shine.""</li></ul>"
phenomenon,"<ul><li>A phenomenon is an extraordinary occurrence or circumstance. In the 1950s, rock-n-roll was considered a new cultural phenomenon, while today we think of crop circles as a mysterious phenomenon.</li><li>Like many words with Greek roots, phenomenon started out as a science term. Scientists used it (and still do) to describe any event or fact that could be observed, amazing or not. An earthquake, for example, was a phenomenon, because you could see it (and hear it and feel it). Phenomenon is an example of a word having a specific meaning for one group of people that gets changed when used by the general public.</li></ul>"
piece,"<ul><li>A piece is a section or a chunk of some larger thing, like a piece of cake or a piece of a broken lamp.</li><li>You can describe a serving of something, like pie, as a piece, and you can also call an individual item within a larger group a piece, like a piece of furniture or a piece of silverware. In this case, you're not breaking off a piece, but you're describing one thing out of a collection.</li></ul>"
pigment,"<ul><li>Something's color is its pigment. Technically, all living things have a natural pigment — leaves have a green pigment for example — but the word is more generally applied to human skin color.</li><li>The other, more technical, use of pigment refers to the substance, usually a powder, that is added to a liquid to give it its color. For example, ultramarine paint is made from a crushed blue silicate that mixed with oil produces a brilliant blue tone. Other pigments were achieved in less pleasant ways. The bright yellow of many Indian paintings? Cow's urine. The red of medieval ox-blood walls? You guessed it.</li></ul>"
pigmentation,"<ul><li>Pigmentation is the natural tint or color of any living thing. The black pigmentation on your dog's tongue is one clue that she may be part chow chow.</li><li>Use this fancy word to mean ""color,"" especially when you're talking about plants or animals (including people). The bright green pigmentation of a tree on your block changes to deep orange by mid-October. And the pigmentation in your skin may be slightly darker than your brother's. The word pigmentation comes from pigment and the Latin pingere, ""to color or paint,"" a root it shares with the English word paint.</li></ul>"
pinnacle,"<ul><li>Going as far into the sky as you can go on foot, you'll reach the highest point, or pinnacle, of the Himalayas. A successful climb like that might also become the pinnacle, or peak, of your success.</li><li>Two synonyms for pinnacle also start with the letter ""p,"" ""peak"" and ""point."" A pinnacle can be a physical thing, like the top of a high mountain or the antenna on the very top of a building, or it can be a high point that can’t be measured with a ruler, like an achievement or a goal. Whatever the pinnacle is, reaching it is almost always a completion of something where you have gone the highest you can go. ""Acme"" is a great synonym for pinnacle.</li></ul>"
pinpoint,"<ul><li>To pinpoint something is to nail down its exact location.</li><li>The point of a pin is very small and fine. Similarly, when you pinpoint something, you have narrowed down its location to the smallest possibility: you've found out exactly where it is. The government is constantly trying to pinpoint the location of terrorists, just as police try to pinpoint the location of criminals. Dogs can pinpoint many things through smell. It's often hard to pinpoint which car is producing an annoying car alarm. When you pinpoint something, you've found it.</li></ul>"

pioneer,"<ul><li>A pioneer is one of the first settlers in a new place. If you desperately want to experience life in space, maybe you will be one of the pioneers who live in the first moon settlement.</li><li>Pioneer comes from the old French for foot soldier or laborer, and particularly for groups of soldiers that would go out ahead of the rest of the troops to prepare the way. The European settlers who came to America in the 16th century are known as pioneers, as are the later groups who traveled West in the 18th and 19th centuries. We also use pioneer for anyone who takes initiative in a field, such as science or education.</li></ul>"
plague,"<ul><li>When the homeowner described her ant problem as a plague, the exterminator thought she was being a bit melodramatic. After all, a few bugs aren't exactly a huge calamity.</li><li>Centuries ago, if you had admitted to a friend that you had the plague, that friend would have hightailed it in the other direction. In the Middle Ages, the plague was a  horribly contagious illness that spread like wildfire through Europe, killing millions of people. Thanks to the introduction of better hygiene and antibiotics, plague doesn't describe a killer disease as often these days. Instead, it commonly overstates an annoyance, like an apartment dweller claiming his building is plagued by cockroaches.</li></ul>"
plausible,"<ul><li>If something is plausible, it's reasonable or believable. Things that are plausible could easily happen. A woman becoming President is very plausible. A giraffe becoming President is not.</li><li>Plausible things are not far-fetched at all. Things in fantasy stories — such as wizards, dragons, and unicorns — are not plausible. On the other hand, some things in science fiction stories might be plausible: who knows where spaceships will eventually go? If something really seems like it could happen, then it's plausible. One of the many tricky parts of life is figuring out what's plausible and what's not.</li></ul>"
pledge,"<ul><li>A pledge is basically very serious formal promise. You can pledge allegiance to your country, you can pledge to keep a secret, and you can pledge a sum of money to a cause.</li><li>Pledge can be used as both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it can be a solemn promise you've made. Or even the person who makes that promise, like the freshman pledges who take an oath to join a fraternity in college. As a verb, it describes the act of promising. “I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people,” vowed Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States.</li></ul>"
plumage,"<ul><li>If you like the looks of the color and pattern formed by a bird’s feathers, then you like its plumage.</li><li>The word plumage traces back to the French word plume, meaning feather, and it’s a way of referring to all the feathers that form the color and patterns of a particular bird. For example, birdwatchers study illustrations of birds so that they can recognize, say, a golden hawk in flight by its plumage.</li></ul>"
pocketbook,"<ul><li>Pocketbook is another name for a purse or wallet, a place to keep money or other essentials. Pocketbook can also refer to the amount of money you have, even if it’s in your mattress.</li><li>In the UK, pocketbook is a pocket-sized notebook, but in the US it's usually a small bag typically carried by women. Figuratively, your pocketbook is your budget: ""Those shoes are way too expensive for my pocketbook."" In the early 1600s, a pocketbook was ""a book small enough to fit in a pocket,"" and by 1722 it became ""a booklike leather folder for papers."" In the early 1800s, it came to mean ""woman's handbag.""</li></ul>"
popular,"<ul><li>The adjective popular describes something that is well-liked or admired by a lot of people. Sometimes when you read a bestselling novel, you wonder why it's so popular.</li><li>Popular comes from the Latin word populus, which means people. Anything that is popular is liked by many people. When you're talking about popular music or art, you may sometimes shorten the word popular to ""pop,"" as in pop music or pop culture. Popular also describes things by or for the people, or the general population, such as the popular vote or a popular revolt.</li></ul>"
pore,"<ul><li>That trickle of sweat didn't just miraculously appear — it was secreted out of a pore, a really tiny opening on the surface of your skin.</li><li>When used as a noun, pore means any tiny hole or opening that allows the passage of liquid. In humans, pores are the little holes that bring us such pleasures as armpit sweat and, when clogged, pimples. But when used as a verb, to pore means to concentrate your attention on or devote hours of focus to something: like poring over the overwhelming choices in the antiperspirant aisle.</li></ul>"
portable,"<ul><li>If something's portable, you can easily take it with you . You may carry your portable computer with you from class to class because it's small, light, and fits easily in your backpack.</li><li>First appearing around 1400, portable stems from the Latin word portare, meaning ""to carry."" Used as an adjective, portable describes something you can carry around easily. Used as a noun, it means a smaller, easy-to-carry version of something, like a computer or television. On a trip, you might take your portable so you can watch movies in the car. Before computers became popular, you might have carried around a lightweight typewriter called a portable.</li></ul>"
portion,"<ul><li>If a friend asks you to invest in her new start-up in exchange for a portion, or part, of the company’s profits, consider the agreement carefully. Remember, a portion of zero is still zero.</li><li>Portion can also refer to the amount of food provided for each person at a meal. If you’re reviewing a restaurant, for example, you'll want to take note of the portion size. In addition, portion can be used as a verb meaning “divide and distribute something.” At birthday parties, we find it odd that the person celebrating her birthday is expected to perform the annoying task of portioning her own cake (perhaps it’s so she can claim the biggest portion).</li></ul>"
pose,"<ul><li>To pose is to assume a particular stance. Like a runway model strutting to the end of the catwalk, posing with her hands on her hips, and then gracefully walking back.</li><li>The original meaning of pose from the 14th century is ""to put in a certain position."" The sense of pose as ""to assume a certain attitude"" emerged in the 1850’s. When a person poses, he presents himself in a particular way, often with the hope of impressing others. But if you're just posing objects, then the word loses the negative connotation.</li></ul>"
posit,"<ul><li>To posit something is to assume or suggest that it is true. You can posit an idea or opinion.</li><li>When you posit, you submit an idea or give an opinion. Scientists posit many ideas — called hypotheses — that they then try to prove or disprove through experimentation and research. In science, you hear about positing a lot, and the same is true in math and logic. When you say ""If X, then Y"" you're positing a proposition. Positing can also mean to put something somewhere firmly — this means to deposit, fix, or situate.</li></ul>"
postulate,"<ul><li>Assume something or present it as a fact and you postulate it. Physicists postulate the existence of parallel universes, which is a little mind-blowing.</li><li>Anyone who has suffered through geometry class is familiar with some of the greatest hits, like Euclid's postulate and the point-line-plane postulate. Those are propositions that have to be assumed for other mathematical statements to follow logically. As a verb (pronounced ""POST-you-late"") it describes the act of presenting an idea, theory, belief, or concept.</li></ul>"
potent,"<ul><li>Potent means really strong, but not like a body builder. Use potent instead to describe things like intense smells, powerful magic potions, and very influential people.</li><li>From the Latin potentum, meaning “powerful,” potent is just that: having tremendous strength or influence in either a moral or physical sense. A potent question gets to the heart of the matter and sparks serious discussion. Really stiff drinks can be potent, as can your breath after a garlicky meal. And as the composer Igor Stravinsky once asked, ""What force is more potent than love?""</li></ul>"
potential,"<ul><li>If you can describe something as possible but not yet actual, choose the adjective potential. Companies try to reach potential customers through advertising.</li><li>Potential, from the Latin potentia ""power,"" sounds more complicated than it is. It describes something or someone that has the power to become something. A potential success is not yet a success but could be if circumstances are right. When a situation has the potential for disaster, it could turn bad easily. You have potential if you have a natural but undeveloped ability to do something and a building with potential will be really nice once it's fixed up.</li></ul>"
practically,"<ul><li>Practically means ""nearly,"" like being practically broke if you have three dollars left in the whole world. It also means ""done in a practical way"" — if you wear sneakers on a long walk, you’re dressed practically.</li><li>There are two main senses of practically. If you have practically no free time, you have nearly no free time. If your hair is practically blonde, it is almost blonde. Also, this word can refer to the sense of practical as sensible and realistic. A smart worker will know how to get the job done practically (efficiently). A smart investor will invest money practically (wisely). Doing things practically is the opposite of being reckless and unrealistic.</li></ul>"
pragmatic,"<ul><li>To describe a person or a solution that takes a realistic approach, consider the adjective pragmatic. The four-year-old who wants a unicorn for her birthday isn't being very pragmatic.</li><li>The opposite of idealistic is pragmatic, a word that describes a philosophy of ""doing what works best."" From Greek pragma, ""deed,"" the word has historically described philosophers and politicians who were concerned more with real-world application of ideas than with abstract notions. A pragmatic person is sensible, grounded, and practical — and doesn't expect a birthday celebration filled with magical creatures.</li></ul>"
precarious,"<ul><li>Grab for the adjective precarious when something is unstable, dangerous or difficult and likely to get worse. Are you totally broke and the people you owe money to keep calling? You're in a precarious financial situation!</li><li>The Latin root of precarious means ""obtained by asking or praying."" This fits well as precarious always signals that help is needed desperately. If your life is precarious or you are in a precarious situation, things could become difficult, maybe even dangerous, for you. If your footing or hold on something is precarious, it is unstable or not firmly placed, so that you are likely to slip or lose your grip.</li></ul>"
precede,"<ul><li>To precede is to come before. A short speech will precede the dinner. As you walk down the garden path, the bed of roses precedes the holly bush. When marching into the room, the younger kids precede the older ones.</li><li>Precede is one of many verbs ending in ""-ceed"" or ""-cede"" that trace their roots back to the Latin word cedere which means ""to go."" For precede, know that it's pre ""first"" + cedere ""go."" When you precede, you go first. You might precede your best friend in line, lunch might precede math class, a joke might precede a lecture, and radio preceded television. Anything that goes first or comes before precedes.</li></ul>"
precious,"<ul><li>To call something precious is to describe it as highly valued. Think of a gemstone when you call your baby sister precious.</li><li>Diamonds, emeralds and rubies are all precious stones and gold and silver are precious metals. If it is something valuable and treasured, it can be called precious too. Fresh water is a precious resource especially in desert countries. Many precious books and painting have been destroyed through fire and war. On a more personal note, guard your memories as they will always be precious to you.</li></ul>"
precipitate,"<ul><li>Precipitate usually means ""bringing something on"" or ""making it happen"" — and not always in a good way. An unpopular verdict might ""precipitate violence"" or one false step at the Grand Canyon could precipitate you down into the gorge.</li><li>Precipitate, as a verb, can also mean specifically, ""to fall from clouds,"" such as rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation. When used as an adjective, precipitate means ""hasty"" or ""acting suddenly."" If you decide to throw your class project in a trash masher just because someone in your class had a similar idea, then your actions might be described as precipitate. Or if you do that sort of thing regularly, you may be a precipitate person.</li></ul>"
precise,"<ul><li>Precise means strictly correct or very exact. If you need something to be precise, like the positioning of a safety net for a stunt jump over a canyon, there's no room for error.</li><li>The word precise might make you think of a scientist carefully measuring the mass of a chemical for an experiment or an accountant double checking her calculations. But there's value to being precise in less formal situations as well. When making a grilled cheese sandwich, for example, it’s important that the arrangement of ingredients be precise: place a tomato in each corner and ensure that the cheese covers every inch of bread so that each bite is full of gooey delight.</li></ul>"
precision,"<ul><li>Use the noun precision to describe something that's exact, such as the work of a carpenter who's made 100 identical pieces of railing for a grand staircase.</li><li>Precision is similar to perfection in that both words suggest that something could not possibly be better. However, perfection describes something that's flawless, such as a beautiful sunset. Precision, on the other hand, is more about accuracy, like computing the exact second that the perfect sunset will occur.</li></ul>"
preclude,"<ul><li>To preclude something is to prevent it from happening. A muzzle precludes a dog from biting.</li><li>This is a very formal word, but it has a simple meaning: when something is precluded, it can't happen. See the prefix pre in preclude and in prevent? It is signaling that these words are all about things done before another action would happen — to make it impossible. Staying away from water precludes the possibility of drowning, though it also precludes any chance of having fun swimming.</li></ul>"
predicament,"<ul><li>If you're engaged to get married but suddenly fall in love with someone else, you have gotten yourself into quite a predicament. A predicament is a difficult, confusing, and unpleasant situation.</li><li>The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means ""a state of being."" Which makes sense considering the words that sound like predicate are all about states of being––predict, or say what's going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a sentence that's led by the verb. Think of predicament as an unpleasant state of being.</li></ul>"
prediction,"<ul><li>I have a prediction: You’ll know what this word means by the time you finish reading this explanation. A prediction is what someone thinks will happen.</li><li>A prediction is a forecast, but not only about the weather. Pre means “before” and  diction has to do with talking. So a prediction is a statement about the future. It’s a guess, sometimes based on facts or evidence, but not always. A fortune teller makes a prediction using a crystal ball. A meteorologist uses maps and scientific data to tell us about the possibility of rain, snow or sunshine. And when I made the prediction that you would understand what this word meant, it was based on instinct, a gut feeling telling me what would happen next.</li></ul>"
predominant,"<ul><li>If you’re talking about the most popular or common thing, call it predominant. If the predominant feeling in a neighborhood is that pizza is the best food, the result might be pizzerias being the predominant type of restaurant there.</li><li>The adjective predominant describes a person or thing with great power or influence, or something that is prevalent. It comes from the Latin prefix prae-, “before,” and dominari, “to rule.” For example, because so many people like hip-hop, it might be the predominant music heard at a school dance. And that neighborhood with all the pizzerias? Teenagers are the predominant customers, and pepperoni is the predominant topping.</li></ul>"
predominantly,"<ul><li>When the weather forecast says the day will be predominantly sunny, that means it will be mostly sunny.</li><li>Like the word dominate, predominantly comes from the Latin dominari meaning ""to rule, dominate, govern."" Use predominantly to describe the general, ruling quality of something, the same way you'd use the phrase ""for the most part.""  An actor who is predominantly in films, appears mostly in movies, but might sometimes do live theater or TV. A neighborhood that is predominantly Indian has mostly Indian people living there, but maybe other groups too, in smaller numbers.</li></ul>"
pre-eminent,
premise,"<ul><li>A premise is what forms the basis of a theory or a plot. When you called 911 on the guy in your back yard, it was on the premise that he was a thief and not the meter-reader.</li><li>In logic, the premise is the basic statement upon whose truth an argument is based. Criticize alternative theories by demonstrating their false premises.  In a more general sense, it's a basic assertion. On the premise that people are generally good, you keep your doors unlocked. Premise is also used more loosely for the starting point for a plot. A movie's premise could be that two people trapped on a desert island will inevitably fall in love.</li></ul>"
preoccupation,"<ul><li>Preoccupation is a state where you're absorbed in something. You may have a preoccupation with video games or Hello Kitty, for example, if you can't keep your mind off those things.</li><li>We all have our preoccupations: ideas and things that we just can't stop thinking about. Just as an occupation means someone is living somewhere, a preoccupation is an idea that's moved in to our minds. One person's preoccupation might be making more money, while another person's preoccupation could be learning to ride a motorcycle. We can also say that someone who is engrossed or absorbed in something is in a state of preoccupation; they're preoccupied.</li></ul>"
preordain,"<ul><li>To preordain something is to decide that it is going to happen in the future, or to influence it to happen. You might believe that your genes preordain you to be a great math student if both of your parents are brilliant mathematicians.</li><li>A magician might preordain the sudden appearance of a rabbit from an empty hat — in other words, she predicts or decides that she'll magically produce the rabbit. Other things preordain certain results by simply pointing in that direction or making the outcome seem inevitable. Torrential rain preordains a soggy croquet course the next day, and a plane's flight plan preordains exactly where (and approximately when) it will land. Pre- means ""before,"" and ordain means ""decide"" or ""order.""</li></ul>"
preponderance,"<ul><li>If there's a preponderance of something, there is A LOT of it. If you are a prosecutor, you are looking for a preponderance of evidence to convince the jury that the defendant is guilty.</li><li>The noun preponderance can also mean ""superiority in weight or significance."" This meaning is particularly reflective of the word's Latin roots in the word praeponderare, which means ""outweigh."" The noun can also mean ""superiority in influence or importance."" A country's economic preponderance, for example, might give it greater influence in international relations.</li></ul>"
prerequisite,"<ul><li>A prerequisite is a required prior condition. If something is required in advance of something else, like if you have to take a beginning Spanish class before signing up for Spanish II, then it’s a prerequisite.</li><li>Add pre meaning ""before"" to require and you have something that's ""required before."" (That's helpful when trying to spell prerequisite!) Prerequisites to be able to graduate from college can seem like a pain, but most schools offer some fun ways to fulfill them. For example, you can often meet the physical education prerequisite by taking bowling.  Prerequisites aren't just for school: “The most called-upon prerequisite of a friend is an accessible ear,” said Maya Angelou, the American poet.</li></ul>"
preserve,"<ul><li>When you preserve something, you maintain its condition, like trying to preserve your good health by exercising regularly and eating right.</li><li>The verb preserve describes keeping something as it is now, without a decline in quality. It can also refer to keeping something safe from harm, as in “The group worked hard to preserve the regional ecosystem.” When you preserve food, such as fruit, you keep it from rotting. Jellies and jams are preserves, the noun form. A preserve can also be lands set aside, or preserved, as animal habitats.</li></ul>"
presumably,"<ul><li>Presumably you are reading these word blurbs because you're interested in learning some useful words. You can add presumably to any statement that you think is true — it indicates a logical conclusion for which you don't have definite proof.</li><li>When you add presumably to whatever you're saying, you're giving notice that you think what you're saying is true but telling your listener not to ask for the evidence. You might watch beer commercials and say to yourself, ""Presumably advertisers think people will find this commercial amusing and want to run out and buy tubs of this beer."" The adverb presumably is related to the nouns presumption and assumption, which are also notions you accept without proof.</li></ul>"
presumable,
prevail,"<ul><li>Prevail means to successfully persuade someone of something. If you were a Presidential advisor and you convinced him to make a National Day of Pet Appreciation, then you prevailed upon him to recognize pets.</li><li>Prevail can be used for different kinds of success. If you prevail upon someone, you have influence on them. If you prevail over someone, you win. Say you’re a big fan of a losing team. You might cheer, “Despite all odds, we will prevail!” To use prevail, there has to be some kind of contest or conflict. That could be internal, like when you have a pile of homework to do, but your desire to play video games prevails over your discipline.</li></ul>"
prevailing,"<ul><li>Something that is prevalent or most common can be described as prevailing. The prevailing opinion in your family might be that your cousin Bob who sleeps in his closet is certifiably insane.</li><li>The adjective prevailing comes from the Latin words prae, meaning before, and valere, meaning to be strong or have power. The English word maintains that sense of strength and predominance. If you live a couple of miles north of a pig farm, and the weatherman says that the prevailing winds will be from the south and gusty, it's probably a good day to keep your windows closed.</li></ul>"
prevalent,"<ul><li>Something prevalent is common in a particular place at a particular time. Prevalent things are hard to avoid. When you see the word prevalent, think ""It's everywhere!""</li><li>Have you ever noticed how all of a sudden a new word, band, or hairstyle will become super-popular? You may never have seen those things before, and then suddenly they're prevalent. When something is common, it's prevalent. You could say drug use is prevalent among criminals. You could say good study habits are prevalent among good students. If a certain opinion is common, then that's a prevalent view in society.</li></ul>"
previous,"<ul><li>Previous means the one that just came before. For instance, the previous sentence explained the meaning of the word previous.</li><li>With previous, you first see that the prefix pre meaning ""before."" The second part of the word, vius, — think via — means ""road,"" so you’re talking about the road, or thing, before. Previous, though, can be used with people, or anything else too. You will know right away if the previous tenants had cats. Do you ever wonder what you were in a previous life? Rivers are at flood stage from the previous two rain storms.</li></ul>"
previously,"<ul><li>The adverb previously is good for talking about something that happened in the past. If you've read a novel previously, you might just skim it before your book group meets to discuss it.</li><li>When you talk about things that happened before, whether recently or in the distant past, the word previously can be helpful. You could mention at a job interview that before your current job, you were previously employed as a flight attendant, or tell a date that though you're single now, you were previously married to a famous movie star. Previously comes from the adjective previous, with its Latin root praevius, ""going before,"" from prae, ""before,"" and via, ""road.""</li></ul>"
primarily,"<ul><li>Primarily means ""for the most part."" If in the summer, you primarily work at a restaurant, this is the thing you do most, though you also might hang out with friends, exercise, and read books.</li><li>You can use the adverb primarily any time you'd use the word ""mainly"" — today, many people rely primarily on the Internet to get their news. This doesn't mean they never read newspapers or watch television news, but most of the time, they learn about current events online. The Latin root of primarily is primus, which means first — most important, most likely, or what you choose before anything else.</li></ul>"
primary,"<ul><li>Primary means basically ""first."" When you vote in a primary, that is the first election in a series. When a matter is of primary concern, it means it's of first importance. Primary school is the first you go to (after nursery school, at least).</li><li>There's an interesting alternate system for counting first, second, third, etc. up to tenth. It's primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, and denary. There's also a word for twelfth, duodenary, though that — along with all the words after tertiary — is rarely used.</li></ul>"
prime,"<ul><li>If something is in its prime, it is at its best. The same goes for a person. If you are young and healthy and in the prime of your life, you are ready to take on the world.</li><li>Prime often means ""main."" The prime reason you go to concerts is to see your favorite groups perform. If your mother is angry that you came home late, tell her that this is a prime example of why you need a cell phone — so you can call her. It can also mean ""of the highest quality"" as in prime beef or flowers. As a verb, prime means to get ready. Hopefully you've primed yourself for your exams. Prime the pump and start the engine!</li></ul>"
primitive,"<ul><li>When we talk about ""primitive man"", we're usually talking about cavemen and other people who existed before the advent of table manners, but if your uncle speaks grunts and chews with his mouth open, you could describe him as primitive too.</li><li>Primitive is related to the word prime, and the root of both words is primus, which is Latin for ""first."" Since the phrase ""primitive man"" refers to the world's first people, you might think that the word primate has something to do with the similarity between early humans and monkeys, but it doesn't.  Monkey, apes, and humans are called primates because they're seen as standing on the first, or highest, rung of the animal-kingdom ladder.</li></ul>"
principal,"<ul><li>For an adjective that points to the main or most important thing, your best choice is principal. Is your principal goal for the summer to have fun or to earn some extra money?</li><li>The word, principal, comes from the Latin principalis ""first in importance"" and is related to the title of prince. You can see the relation when you think about its meanings — the head of a school, the starring actor in a film, and the client of an agent. Don't confuse principal with its homophone principle, a moral rule or law of nature. If you talk about a country's principal exports, you mean the main ones.</li></ul>"
principle,"<ul><li>A principle is a kind of rule, belief, or idea that guides you. You can also say a good, ethical person has a lot of principles.</li><li>In general, a principle is some kind of basic truth that helps you with your life. ""Be fair"" is a principle that guides (or should guide) most people and businesses. A politician who tries to do the right thing rather than win votes is acting on principle. A person who has principles is a good, decent person. On the other hand, if you say someone has no principles, that means they're dishonest, corrupt, or evil.</li></ul>"
prior,"<ul><li>Generally you should eat dinner prior to brushing your teeth. Use the adjective prior for things that exist earlier in time or that happen first in time or order.</li><li>This is a formal word that is often used in legal language. A prior claim is a person's right to something that is considered more important or valuable because it came first. If you're looking for a less formal synonym, choose the word previous. Prior is from a Latin word with the same spelling.</li></ul>"
priority,"<ul><li>When a group or a person cares about one thing over all others, that’s the top priority. “After the flood, finding a place to live became their first priority.”</li><li>Priority comes from the word prior, which means to come before something else.  A priority is the concern, interest or desire that comes before all others. “His first priority was to establish his career and get married later.”  “When seeking the perfect wave, Jeff and Wayne made it their priority to be the first surfers on the beach.” ""The new CEO's top priority was firing her predecessor's hires.""</li></ul>"
pristine,"<ul><li>If something is pristine it's immaculately clean or has never been used. So please check your shoes before walking on a pristine white carpet.</li><li>A long, long time ago pristine was used to describe primitive or ancient things. It wasn’t until 1899 that the word grew to mean ""unspoiled"" or ""pure."" Ecologists strive to preserve pristine rain forests, just as vacationers are always looking for a pristine strip of beach to lounge on. A new car should arrive to you in pristine condition, and hopefully you'll do your best to keep it that way.</li></ul>"
prized,
probe,"<ul><li>If you probe something, you investigate it thoroughly.  If you go into business with someone, you might probe her finances to make sure that she has a good track record.</li><li>Although it is usually used as a verb — ""the police probed the man’s disappearance"" — it can also be used as a noun to describe an information-gathering device. In 1979 the United States launched the world's first space probe into outer space.  It was a spacecraft rigged with cameras, which were used to photograph Jupiter and Saturn.</li></ul>"
process,"<ul><li>A process is a procedure, something you do in order to achieve a certain result. Some people try to carefully follow all the steps in a process. Other people just wing it.</li><li>You hear this word being used a lot to describe work. ""I am in the process of drafting a memo, even if I kill myself with late nights in the process."" The related word procession describes people or vehicles moving forward in an orderly way — a wedding opens with the bridal procession.</li></ul>"
procure,"<ul><li>In prison movies, there's always a character who is able to procure all sorts of contraband from the inside — magazines, playing cards, special soap. If you procure something, you get it or bring it about by special effort.</li><li>Procure's synonym obtain is a little formal, but less formal than procure itself. The noun procurement commonly refers to the obtaining of materials and supplies. Procure descends from Middle English procuren, from Old French procurer, ""to take care of,"" from Latin prōcūrāre, formed from the prefix prō-, ""for"", plus cūrāre, ""to care for.""</li></ul>"
profound,"<ul><li>When you need a word that's deeper than ""deep,"" consider profound. A philosopher is likely to make many profound pronouncements.</li><li>Profundus literally means ""deep"" in Latin, and profound had the same meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it also meant ""figuratively deep"" — that is, very great or intense: ""The new laws have had a profound impact."" Of people, it means ""very knowledgeable or insightful,"" but sometimes when a person tries to sound profound, they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed up with big words.</li></ul>"
programmed,
progressively,
prohibitive,"<ul><li>That expensive Ferrari in the showroom? You may want it, but its price is prohibitive — which means the price is discouragingly high and likely to deter you from buying.</li><li>Prohibitive originally referred to something (often a law) that prohibits or forbids something, but it came to mean conditions (often prices or taxes) so high or great they restrict or prevent something: ""To some, the cost of child care is prohibitive."" The stress is on the second syllable, just like the verb: pro-HIB-i-tive. If it's a matter of expense, a synonym is exorbitant.</li></ul>"
projection,"<ul><li>When you push something away from a central structure, that's called projection.  If you predict that the Jets will win tomorrow's game, that's a projection, too — you're pushing your mind away from the present and into the future.</li><li>The Jets and projection actually have a common linguistic ancestor. Both the ject in projection and the word jet come from the Latin root jactus, which means ""throw."" A jet plane throws itself — or projects itself — away from a central structure (the Earth) and into the air.</li></ul>"
proliferate,"<ul><li>When something proliferates, it's growing, spreading or multiplying really quickly. Bunny rabbits have a habit of proliferating, as do dandelions in untended gardens and funny YouTube videos on the internet.</li><li>Proliferate was originally a biological term used to describe the growth of cells and producing offspring. It wasn’t until 1961 that we started to use proliferate more generally to talk about everything from the spread of nuclear weapons to the wide growth of Walmart. Other similar words include expand, reproduce, snowball, and spawn.</li></ul>"
proliferation,"<ul><li>Proliferation is a rapid multiplication of parts or the increase in the number of something. Nuclear proliferation is a rapid increase of nuclear weapons.</li><li>The proliferation of any living thing will often create an overpopulation problem and cause an environmental imbalance. A proliferation of fuzzy koala bears might seem kind of nice, but these cute little creatures would soon eat up all the eucalyptus, running out of food and causing problems for other species. We almost always use this word to describe stuff we don't want to increase rapidly. The excessive proliferation of mutated cells, for instance, is how cancer grows.</li></ul>"
prolifically,
prolong,"<ul><li>I don't want to prolong this definition, so I'll keep it short. To prolong is to make something last longer or to stretch it out in time.</li><li>You see the word long in prolong and it's no trick. If you prolong an argument with a sibling, you make it longer than it naturally would be. Prolong always has to do with time. When you stretch  your neck or a piece of cloth to make it appear longer, you are elongating, not prolonging, it.</li></ul>"
prominent,"<ul><li>If you're looking for an adjective that means ""sticking out above the rest; famous,"" consider prominent. A prominent person might be the big star, the head honcho, the top dog — not just any ordinary person.</li><li>A prominence is anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain ridge. Prominent, then, means ""sticking out"" either in a literal sense (""a prominent nose"") or a figurative one (""a prominent figure in the industry""). The metaphorical sense of ""famous"" is the most common one today, so you're more likely to hear about prominent people than prominent noses.</li></ul>"
promote,"<ul><li>If you work for a marketing firm, your job is to promote new products — to publicize them and to try to get the public to buy them.</li><li>The verb promote can also mean to advance to a higher position. Because of your hard work, your boss might decide to promote you. In school, passing students are promoted each year when they enter a higher grade. In chess, the verb promote is used when a pawn is exchanged for a higher ranking piece. Make sure you promote your pawn to a queen, giving you two queens on the board and a strong advantage in the game.</li></ul>"
prompt,"<ul><li>If you're prompt, you're on time. Go ahead and be prompt to class. Also, to prompt is to inspire or make happen. Getting in trouble for being late should prompt you to get a better alarm clock.</li><li>The adjective prompt can mean ""as scheduled,"" or simply ""quick."" When you prompt someone, you motivate them in some way: you might offer a reminder, assistance, or even inspiration to do something. For example, honking your car horn prompts your friend to get moving, and speaking up in defense of your classmate might prompt a bully to change his ways. If a director prompts an actor who's forgotten his lines, she reminds him what comes next.</li></ul>"
pronounced,"<ul><li>You can't miss something that's pronounced, because it's totally obvious. If you sprain your ankle playing soccer, you might walk with a pronounced limp for a few days.</li><li>When things are pronounced, they're noticeable or conspicuous, like the pronounced lines in your grandfather's face or the pronounced Italian accent of your new neighbor who just arrived from Rome. The original meaning of this word was simply ""spoken,"" and you can also use it that way: for example, the word ""eve"" has one pronounced e and one silent e. But the ""emphatic or obvious"" meaning is far more common.</li></ul>"
propagate,"<ul><li>To propagate is to be fruitful and multiply, by the usual routes of reproduction, or by spreading something around — like a rumor.</li><li>Propagate comes from the Latin word propagare, which means ""to reproduce plants, breed."" Plants love to propagate, especially when someone with a green thumb starts off with a jade plant stem in water and ends up with a garden full of the succulents. Plants aren't the only things to propagate like bunnies: in some apocalyptic movies, a virus propagates quickly, killing almost everyone in the world. Sound and light can also spread, or propagate, through the air.</li></ul>"
propel,"<ul><li>To propel is to push or drive forward, like a sheep dog nipping at the heels of his flock to keep them moving.</li><li>When you hear the verb propel,  imagine the propeller on an airplane — that spinning thing on the front that pulls the plane forward. Or maybe think of the old proverb that goes, “Our passions are the winds that propel our vessel. Our reason is the pilot that steers her. Without winds the vessel would not move and without a pilot she would be lost.”</li></ul>"
property,"<ul><li>What you own or have, like a car or clothes, is your property. The qualities that a thing has are its properties. Aloe is a plant with medicinal properties — it soothes burns.</li><li>If you see a sign that says, ""Private property, keep off,"" the land-owner does not want you to go on his or her land. If you go on it anyway, you're trespassing. You'll often hear people talking about property values. When they say this, they really just mean how much the land they own is worth. People like to talk about property values when they are on the rise. When they are falling, not so much.</li></ul>"
proponent,"<ul><li>Proponent means someone who is in favor of something. You might be a proponent of longer vacations, but your parents are proponents of a longer school year.</li><li>If you’re in favor of long school vacations, you’re pro or ""for"" long vacations. The prefix pro- also carries the meaning of “forward,” “ahead,” or “before.” All of these senses are at work in proponent: someone who suggests (puts forward) an idea or who is in favor of an idea. A proponent proposes an idea or advocates for a proposal or a proposition.</li></ul>"
proposal,"<ul><li>A proposal is an offer. When making a marriage proposal, get down on one knee. When making a business proposal, try to stay off the floor.</li><li>A proposal is a suggested plan or offer. After overhearing the marriage proposal, everyone in the restaurant watched in silence, waiting to hear your answer. At least you said ""yes"" to dessert. There are other types of proposals besides marriage offers: ""Your proposal that the dollar be replaced by a new currency made of cheese has gained support from the dairy industry.""</li></ul>"
prosper,"<ul><li>As any fan of Star Trek knows, “live long and prosper” is good advice. The verb prosper means to do well, succeed, or thrive.</li><li>The verb prosper commonly means to generate wealth, as in “she hopes to prosper from her new investments.” But more generally it means “grow stronger” or ""flourish"" — crops will prosper when they have adequate sun and water, and rescued animals can prosper in a loving home. You can also prosper from good advice or a wise decision: for example, “cheaters never prosper” is one piece of advice that might help you prosper.</li></ul>"
prosperity,"<ul><li>Use prosperity to refer to the state of being successful. In the US, the decades following World War II were characterized by rising prosperity, with large numbers moving into the middle class.</li><li>Prosperity usually means the type of success that comes from having a lot of money. Our modern English word derives from Middle English prosperite, borrowed through Old French from Latin prosperus ""favorable."" The Latin word also means ""fortunate,"" and the word prosperity does have an element of good luck.</li></ul>"
prosperous,"<ul><li>If you have a new car, a new high-paying job, and some flashy new shoes, then you could be described as prosperous, meaning you have material success that seems like it will continue to grow.</li><li>The adjective prosperous often describes a person or a person’s future, but it can apply to anything that’s experiencing growth and success. Prosperous derives from the Latin word prosperus, meaning “doing well.” Great pronouns of this happy word include golden, well-heeled, flourishing, and thriving.</li></ul>"
prototype,"<ul><li>A prototype is the original model, a sample on which to base future designs. A company designing a new toaster will first design and build a prototype and then test it out and see if it's any good.</li><li>A prototype is your test case and becomes the model on which to base the design of the finished product. Often, however, the prototype can be a phase to work out the bugs. The prototype of our hands-free toothbrush was too dangerous; it needed to return to the lab for serious improvements. Like the word archetype, the word prototype can also mean the standard on which to base a definition of something. ""A prototypical cheerleader is the girl to which all other cheerleaders might aspire.""</li></ul>"
protrude,"<ul><li>Protrude means to stick out. A gravestone protrudes from the ground, a shelf protrudes from a wall, a lollipop stick protrudes from your mouth.</li><li>From the Latin prō- ""forward, out"" + trūdere ""to thrust,"" protrude often describes coastlines where rocks stick out into the water. Prō- gives us protrusion ""something that sticks out,"" and protuberance ""something that grows out of something else""––a goiter, for example, or a nose.</li></ul>"
provided,
provoke,"<ul><li>Anything that brings about a strong reaction can be said to provoke. You can provoke that lion if you want. But if he responds by attacking, don't come running to me.</li><li>Let's consider some people who have been known to provoke. Lenny Bruce, was more than just a comedian. He was a ""provocateur"" who used humor to deliver his controversial diatribes. Humor was his way to provoke people to think. Madonna made her name not only by producing a memorable catalogue of great pop songs, she proved herself to be a master at provoking people through her outrageous attire and lyrics. The moral of this story? It's possible to provoke both positive and negative responses.</li></ul>"
prowess,"<ul><li>Prowess means exceptional skill or ability. Your sailing prowess might save your life in a storm, while someone with less experience might make mistakes.</li><li>An earlier meaning of this word is exceptional bravery in battle, or a specific act of bravery. Prowess is a Middle English word borrowed from the Old French proesse, ""courage, brave deed,"" from prud, ""good, capable, brave."" The related English word proud originally had the now obsolete meaning of ""brave.""</li></ul>"
proximity,"<ul><li>The word proximity means nearness or closeness. ""Because of the proximity of our desks, I couldn't help but notice him cheating on the exam.""</li><li>Your favorite thing about your neighborhood of attached row houses might be the proximity of your neighbors — they're really close to you. Proximity comes from the Latin proximus, ""nearest,"" which also gives us approximate, ""close to the actual."" You can use this noun to talk about a physical closeness, or something that's near in time, like the proximity of the months April and May.</li></ul>"
purpose,"<ul><li>When you do something with purpose, you do it with determination. When your activities have a purpose, you have an aim or intention in mind.</li><li>This noun also has a third meaning: ""function, role, or use."" The purpose of a fork, for instance, is to spear and scoop food from your plate, not to poke your little brother at the dinner table. Purpose can also be used as a verb meaning ""to reach a decision"" or ""to intend,"" though these uses of the word are quite a bit less frequent nowadays.</li></ul>"
pursue,"<ul><li>Use the verb pursue when you're chasing after someone or something. A hungry lion might pursue a zebra, the paparazzi might pursue a celebrity, and a young dancer might pursue her dream of becoming a prima ballerina.</li><li>Pursue originally meant ""to follow with hostile intent,"" from a Latin root word, prosequi, ""follow, accompany, follow after, or follow up."" Today, when you pursue someone, it's not necessarily with bad intentions. A police officer, for example, might pursue a criminal, and your dog might pursue your cat around the house just for fun. If you pursue a career in journalism, you are working to achieve it. Likewise, you pursue a strategy or a hobby if you do it consistently.</li></ul>"
quarter,"<ul><li>A quarter is one-fourth of something. If you cut a pizza into four pieces and share it with three friends, each of you will eat a quarter of the pizza.</li><li>A quarter is the same thing as twenty-five percent of something. Many sporting events are divided this way, and you'll often hear sports commentators saying things like, ""Here is the score at the end of the first quarter."" The Latin word quartus, ""fourth,"" is at the root of quarter, and the earliest — and goriest — use specifically referred to a form of execution that involved dismembering a prisoner's body into four pieces, or quarters.</li></ul>"
radical,"<ul><li>If something is considered extremist or very different from anything that has come before it, call it radical.</li><li>The noun, radical, comes from the Latin radix ""root,"" and in fact, radical and root are synonymous as technical terms in fields such as math and linguistics. In more everyday language, a radical is someone who has very extreme views, so you could say that their views are different from the root up. Similarly, a radical flaw or change is a fundamental one whereas a radical design or idea is very new and innovative.</li></ul>"
radically,"<ul><li>The adverb radically is a great way to say ""in an extreme way."" When your formerly long-haired friend shows up at work with a crew cut, you could say that she looks radically different.</li><li>Use radically to describe things that are done in a big way, particularly a change or an extreme position. For example, the government in your state might change radically after an important election. You'll often see the phrase ""radically different"" used to mean a change that's enormous, possibly even transforming. Though the root of radically, radical, originally meant ""root of a word,"" it came to mean ""far-reaching, innovative, or extreme,"" especially when it describes political views.</li></ul>"
raise,"<ul><li>If you raise your hand, you put it up in the air. If you raise your daughter, you “bring her up” from childhood to adulthood. And, if you raise the roof, you and a crowd of people cheer wildly for a performer.</li><li>Raise can be used almost any time you bring something up, either literally: “if you raise the lid on that trap door you will see a secret passage,” or figuratively: “please don't raise the topic of my arachnophobia.” The verb raise comes from the Old English word ræran, which means “to rear,” as in, “do you really want to raise your children in that town?” As a noun, a raise can also mean a salary increase.</li></ul>"
ramification,"<ul><li>A ramification is an accidental consequence that complicates things. Remember that time you borrowed your father's car without asking? The ramification was that Dad missed an important meeting, his company went under, and he had to sell the car. Oops!</li><li>The ramifications are the broader effects that fan out into the world from one situation, or decision, that kicks it all off. Ramification also refers to something branching out, like limbs on a tree — which is what bad decisions tend to do. Ramification is like consequence, but usually unintended and bad. The word is often used in political discussions about laws or government decisions because they might be made locally but could affect people worldwide.</li></ul>"
random,"<ul><li>Something that’s random is lacking in order, plan, or purpose. It happens totally by chance, like the random picking of lottery numbers or unplanned random acts of kindness.</li><li>Sometime in the 1980s, teenage slang hijacked the adjective random and tried to turn it into a word meaning weird, odd or out of place. As in ""Dude! That guy wearing purple spandex at the party was so random!""  But don't fall for it. Something that’s truly random is totally governed by chance and has no specific pattern, like choosing a card at random from a magician’s deck.</li></ul>"
range,"<ul><li>The word range refers to a variety of things or to an area in which something operates. The store offers the living room set in a range of colors. What's the range of that remote-controlled airplane?</li><li>As a noun, range can also be used to describe a set of mountains such as the Sierra Nevada or it can mean a grassy plain where cattle graze. As a verb, use range to mean a span or variety of things. Your family conversation at the dinner table probably ranges over a variety of topics. At school, you learn about many subjects ranging from English literature to calculus to European history.</li></ul>"
rare,"<ul><li>If an event is rare, it doesn't happen often.  If an object is rare, there aren't many of its kind.  Obviously, finding a rare gem is a rare occasion.</li><li>Rare comes from the Latin word rarus, meaning “widely spaced,” as rare things are — whether in actual space or in time. You thought  it was rare to meet someone you have so much in common with, until he fainted looking at the rare steak you ordered. The rare that describes prepared meat actually has a separate origin: it comes from the long-gone word rear, meaning “half-cooked.”</li></ul>"
rate,"<ul><li>When you pay a high rate, you pay a lot of money.  When you move at a high rate of speed, you go fast.  If you are a judge at a contest, you rate the contestants.</li><li>It's interesting how one word can have different origins for different meanings. For example, the noun rate, referring to amounts comes from the Latin rata, “a fixed amount.” But the verb rate seems to come from the Scandinavian rata, ""to reject.""  If the person you are dating asks you to rate them against your previous partners, you might change the subject at a high rate of speed.</li></ul>"
rather than,
rational,"<ul><li>Use the adjective rational to describe people or ideas that operate according to logic or reason. While your brother has an artistic temperament, you have a rational one.</li><li>Rational comes from the Latin word rationalis, meaning reasonable or logical.  If you're rational, you do things based on logic, as opposed to impulse or whimsy. The original meaning in English was of something endowed with the ability to reason. Before we knew how smart some animals like dolphins are, writers liked to distinguish rational human minds from the supposedly irrational, instinctual minds of animals.</li></ul>"
ravage,"<ul><li>The word ravage can be used as a noun or a verb meaning destruction or to destroy. In a war, bombs and the attacking army will ravage the country under siege.</li><li>When ravage is used as a noun, you usually see it in the plural. Beware of the ravages of drugs on your body and your life. The city has almost been destroyed by the ravages of poverty and disaster. Often you see it paired with the word, time, to describe how things fall apart as they age. The ravages of time may be apparent in the lined faces and hunched postures of your grandparents.</li></ul>"
readily,"<ul><li>Anything happening readily is happening without difficulty. A great party has cupcakes that are readily available. A great host will readily admit when it’s time to put more on the table.</li><li>Things happening readily are easy and accessible. If you readily admit that you love cupcakes, you’ll tell anyone who asks. A readily available product is easily available to just about everyone. Thanks to the Internet, pictures of cats wearing funny outfits are readily available. This word can also apply to things that happen quickly. When a party is over, good guests readily get their coats and leave.</li></ul>"
ready,"<ul><li>If you're ready for something, you're prepared — you're all set to do it. You're not truly ready for bed until you're wearing pajamas and have finished brushing your teeth.</li><li>You can be physically ready, like when you grab a towel and sunblock to get ready for a day at the beach, or mentally ready, like when you're ready to rock your algebra test since you studied so much. Other things are ready when they're available, like dinner or a hotel room. If you ready something (or yourself), you prepare for some specific purpose. The Old English ræde meant ""prepare a horse for riding,"" from a root meaning ""ride.""</li></ul>"
realm,"<ul><li>A realm is an area that is ruled by something. If you are a controlling cook who doesn’t like anyone to do anything else in the kitchen, then the kitchen is your realm.</li><li>Realm comes from the French for kingdom, but since there aren’t so many kings or queens left in the world, you’ll more often find it referring to non-royal spheres. That could be the sphere of a special kind of knowledge, like the realm of biology, or the political realm. Or it could be an area dominated by some group. Little Italy was famously the realm of the mafia; Hollywood is the realm of film stars.</li></ul>"
reasonable,"<ul><li>Reasonable describes someone or something that's sensible and fair, like your teacher who gives reasonable homework assignments — they don't take you forever to do and they relate to what you are studying.</li><li>If you're reasonable, you have good sense and judgment. A reasonable decision is rational and thought out, like your mom's reasonable rule about not eating crumbly foods in her car. When you describe a store's prices as reasonable, you mean they're fair — not too high. And if you are given a reasonable amount of time to do a project for school, you have no excuse for it being late.</li></ul>"
rebellion,"<ul><li>A rebellion is when you rise up and fight those in power, usually on a large scale. In ""Star Wars,"" the good guys fighting the powerful, evil empire were known as the rebellion.</li><li>If you know that a rebel is someone who fights authority, then you won’t be surprised that a rebellion is something similar. Rebellions can be wars, particularly wars for independence from the ruling government, but many rebellions never come to armed conflict. Most of the time they're wars of words, or even just small-scale rule-breaking that is supposed to make a larger point. Students might wear shorts to school, for example, as a rebellion against the dress code.</li></ul>"
rebound,"<ul><li>To rebound is to come back from a slump. You might rebound from an illness, or your country might rebound from an economic recession.</li><li>Like many words that start with the prefix re, rebound involves something happening again. In this case, to rebound is to bounce back to a previous state or condition. When you start to feel happy again after your heart gets broken, you rebound. If the stock market crashes and then returns to a healthy level, it rebounds.</li></ul>"
receptacle,"<ul><li>A receptacle is a container that's used for holding or storing things. If you are having a party on a rainy day, you can put a receptacle outside your door for your guests' umbrellas.</li><li>The noun receptacle means any kind of container. For example, a trash receptacle holds your garbage and a receptacle for loose change can keep you from scattering coins all over your house. In botany, receptacle refers to the part of a stem that holds a plant's organs. The word receptacle comes from the Latin root word receptaculum, which describes a place to receive and store things.</li></ul>"
receptivity,"<ul><li>Your receptivity is your ability and willingness to take in information or ideas. An audience's receptivity to a stand up comedian helps to make her performance a success.</li><li>The noun receptivity is useful for describing someone's openness, especially to new ideas or different opinions. An interviewer's receptivity makes it clear that he's really listening to what a job applicant is saying, and the receptivity of movie audiences can result in laughter, applause, and big money made at the box office. The Latin root word of both receptivity and receive is recipere, ""bring back, recover, take in, or admit.""</li></ul>"
recharge,"<ul><li>When you recharge something, you bring it back to life or reenergize it. You might charge your cell phone in the morning and then recharge it later in the day.</li><li>If you can charge your electronics (or provide them with electrical energy), you can also recharge them when that energy is depleted. In addition to your camera battery and laptop, sometimes you need to recharge yourself, or take a break so you can become energized again. Less commonly, recharge is used to mean ""refill a glass,"" and the original meaning, in the fifteenth century, was ""to reload a vessel.""</li></ul>"
reconcile,"<ul><li>Reach for the verb reconcile to make different things come together or resolve a matter.</li><li>If you've ever had an argument with someone and then made up, you have reconciled. Reconcile is a verb that can mean ""to become resigned"" like if you're reconciled to getting the bottom bunk when you wanted the top. It also means to ""bring into agreement and harmony."" Words like it are pacify, harmonize, and accommodate — reconcile is definitely an agreeable word!</li></ul>"
recur,"<ul><li>Have you ever had the same crazy dream night after night? If so, you know that dreams can recur, meaning they repeat, or happen again.</li><li>The verb recur is used to describe something that happens over and over, whether it’s an injury, an argument, or a character who pops up from time to time on a television show. Recur often describes an event that happens repeatedly, but it can also be used to describe something, such as an image or a memory, that for some reason just keeps popping back up in your mind, like self-doubt that recurs every time you worry about something.</li></ul>"
refine,"<ul><li>When you refine something, you make it better. Whether it's sugar or an essay, refining it requires fixing its flaws.</li><li>You may think you created a masterpiece on the first try. But there's always room to refine. More than just working out the kinks, refining something means you're going to fine tune it, hone it to perfection, and make it more precise. In scientific terms, to refine something means to reduce it down to a pure state. At the dinner table, you can please grandma by refining your manners.</li></ul>"
refined,"<ul><li>Something that's refined has gone through a process to remove impurities. An oil refinery removes impurities from oil. When a person's refined, they have good manners and good taste.</li><li>A stereotypically refined lady will drink tea every day at four in the afternoon, lift her pinky while drinking, and select only refined (pure white, not raw) sugar as a sweetener. Someone with a refined taste in art has learned how to make judgments about what is good and what they like.</li></ul>"
refreshing,"<ul><li>Something is refreshing if it reinvigorates you, or seems new and exciting. The offer of a refreshing glass of iced tea would be especially refreshing if it came from your normally cranky sister.</li><li>Mint toothpaste is refreshing — clean and brisk — and a cool ocean breeze is refreshing on a hot day. If you're used to seeing wilted salads and pale lasagna in your school cafeteria every day, a refreshing change would be a taco bar or homemade pizza. Refreshing comes from the verb refresh, which has a Germanic root similar to frisc, ""fresh"" in Old High German.</li></ul>"
refuge,"<ul><li>To take refuge is to find a safe place. You might take refuge under a bridge in a hail storm, or in a basement during a tornado.</li><li>Refuge comes from a French word meaning ""to flee,"" and, in most cases, a refuge is a place to flee to in order to get away from people or places that are unsafe. A refuge is a safe place, such as a building or even another country, as in ""they sought refuge from the war by leaving their homeland,"" or it is a simple, personal place of comfort — like a friend's couch.</li></ul>"
regardless,"<ul><li>If something is done without consideration, it's done regardless, usually followed by the word ""of."" Today you can sit wherever you'd like on a bus, regardless of your race, but this wasn't always the case.</li><li>The word regardless can also be used as an adverb meaning despite everything. If your speaker had to cancel, you should carry on with the meeting regardless. People sometimes use the word irregardless when they mean regardless. Irregardless is an error resulting from a blend of irrespective and regardless. You may hear people say it, but grammarians consider it to be a mistake.</li></ul>"
regenerate,"<ul><li>Starfish are famous for their ability to regenerate, or regrow, a lost arm. Anything that revives in this magical way can be said to regenerate.</li><li>While the verb regenerate can literally mean ""produce anew,"" it can also describe what happens when something is fixed up, made ""like new."" An argument that's often made for bringing a new company, sports complex, casino, or other enterprise to a depressed area is that it will regenerate the town economically, bringing it back to life. In Latin, regeneratio means ""being born again.""</li></ul>"
regrettable,"<ul><li>Regrettable describes things that make you feel sorry. Letting your sister borrow your own snow shovel became a regrettable decision the moment the big storm started.</li><li>Actions and events are regrettable if they result in feelings of regret, or if they're unwelcome or undesirable. Wearing your least comfortable shoes on a walking tour of Paris will be a regrettable choice if blisters form on your toes. Remember, regrettable describes things like decisions, actions or words. Regretful is for describing people and feelings that express regret.</li></ul>"
regulate,"<ul><li>The on-off spigot regulates the flow of water into your bathtub. When a government regulates an industry, they set standards the industry must follow. To regulate means to impose control.</li><li>Regulate shares a root with the word, regular. When the transit authority regulates a train schedule, it makes sure trains arrive on a more regular schedule. The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated –– before a drug can be marketed, it must be tested. On a more personal level, if you want to regulate your digestive system, try eating more fiber... or prunes!</li></ul>"
reinforce,"<ul><li>To reinforce means to make stronger. You can reinforce your roof by putting some extra supports under it.</li><li>Besides a physical structure, there are many things you can reinforce. If you want to reinforce a message, you can say it louder, rephrase and repeat it or give examples of what you expect. You use dog biscuits to reinforce certain behaviors in your dog. Bad experiences will reinforce your fears, good ones your hopes. And when military leaders reinforce their troops, they send additional soldiers to the front.</li></ul>"
relative,"<ul><li>A relative is a person who is part of your family. Parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, nieces and nephews — they're all relatives.</li><li>A relative can be connected to your family through blood or by marriage. If you are a child or grandchild of Maria's, for example, you are a blood relative of her family. If you marry Maria's son, you become a relative by marriage. Relative is also an adjective that means ""estimated by comparison,"" like the steep hill that is tiny, relative to the mountain behind it.</li></ul>"
relatively,"<ul><li>Use relatively when you want to make a statement about something compared to something else. After a zero degree day, 30 degrees might feel relatively warm.</li><li>This adverb has to do with how things stack up next to each other. Relatively speaking, you could say you're tall if you're around very short people, even if you're just five five. Fat free ice cream is relatively healthy compared to other desserts, but it's still ice cream. If you've been sick for a week and you feel relatively better, you're feeling just a little better. This word only makes sense when you're comparing one thing to another.</li></ul>"
relevant,"<ul><li>Something is relevant if it's appropriate or connected to the matter at hand. Relevant things are helpful and on point.</li><li>Relevant things are appropriate and make sense at that particular time. In the middle of history class, your teacher loves to get relevant questions: questions that have to do with the material. The teacher won't be thrilled to get a question about math: that's not relevant. You can also say a song or movie is relevant if it's connected to current events or issues people are talking about. When something is relevant, it just fits what is happening.</li></ul>"
relic,"<ul><li>A relic is a fragment from the past — one of Elvis's guitars, an ancient piece of pottery or even an outmoded way of thinking -– that remains behind. Your dad might love his old albums, but to you, they're just relics.</li><li>The noun relic is derived from relinquere, Latin for ""to leave behind.""  A crumbling Roman wall is a relic of a once-great civilization. The superstition that seven years of bad luck will follow if you break a mirror may be a relic of the old superstition that a mirror can trap the souls of those reflected in it. Whether it's an object or an idea, a relic is a remnant of the past. Religious relics are items, such as Buddha’s tooth or St. Anne’s wrist bone, that have been preserved and venerated.</li></ul>"
reluctance,"<ul><li>Reluctance means ""unwillingness."" Your reluctance to travel on an airplane would be understandable if you glimpsed the pilot and copilot wearing party hats and blowing noisemakers.</li><li>If you'd rather not do something, you feel a sense of reluctance about it. You pause for a moment, maybe to consider whether you should really go through with it, or just to enjoy the last moment before it happens. The word comes from the Latin reluctari, or to struggle against. There's always a struggle when reluctance is present, in that you feel pressure to do something or in not agreeing right away, someone is going to be disappointed.</li></ul>"
reluctant,"<ul><li>If the adjective reluctant applies to you, it means that you are undergoing some inner struggle and are unwilling or unable to decide.</li><li>The word reluctant comes from the Latin reluctantem, which means ""to struggle against."" These days reluctant means “unwilling.” If you’re reluctant to dance to a terrible song, you’re unwilling to shake your booty, and you might even have to struggle against your friends who try to get you on the dance floor. You might offer them a reluctant smile instead (and hope it doesn’t look like a grimace).</li></ul>"
remarkable,"<ul><li>Something remarkable is unusual, exceptional, interesting, or excellent. Remarkable things get your attention.</li><li>If you take this word literally, you can figure out the meaning: remarkable things make you want to make a remark about them. They get you talking because they're so unusual or good. Getting a B on a test isn't remarkable, unless you usually get D’s. Getting to meet the president would be pretty remarkable. Save this word for things that are really and truly exceptional.</li></ul>"
remarkably,
remedy,"<ul><li>A remedy is something that relieves or cures a problem or illness. Aloe vera is a common remedy for sunburn.</li><li>If you're having trouble sleeping, the first remedy you might try is a hot bath and a cup of chamomile tea. If that doesn't help, you may resort to something stronger, like a sedative. If a streetlight shining in your window is part of the problem, you can remedy the situation with some room-darkening shades. But if it's your upstairs neighbors and their all-night partying that's keeping you awake, you may have to consider a legal remedy.</li></ul>"
remnant,"<ul><li>A remnant is something that's left over, once the rest is used up. If you plan to sew a shirt using only a remnant, it might have to be a midriff shirt.</li><li>The noun remnant can also be used to refer to leftover things other than cloth. The origin of the word might help you remember this, more all-purpose, meaning — it comes from the French remanant, which means ""to remain."" Think of it this way:  a remnant is something that remains, or is left behind.  For example, the remnants from the ancient battle gave archaeologists clues from which to infer what had happened.</li></ul>"

Think of it this way:  a remnant is something that remains, or is left behind.  For example, the remnants from the ancient battle gave archaeologists clues from which to infer what had happened.</li></ul>"
remote,"<ul><li>Remote describes something far, far away, like a campsite way out in the woods, a distant planet, or the chance you'll win the lottery.</li><li>The Australian outback is remote, since it's hard to get to and there aren't many people there. It's also remote in the sense that it's far away from civilization. Someone with a faraway look in her eye, not answering your questions is also remote. Remote can describe something unlikely, like that lottery win. You might win, but your chances are so remote you shouldn't count on it.</li></ul>"
render,"<ul><li>Render is a synonym of ""make"" — technically it means ""cause to become."" An illness might render you unable to walk, or a shocking sight might render you speechless.</li><li>Another basic meaning of the verb render is to give, present, or perform something: you could render assistance to someone in need, for example. And a specialized sense is to formally declare a verdict in a court case. Render derives from the Latin verb reddere, ""to restore,"" from the prefix re-, ""back,"" plus dare, ""to give.""</li></ul>"
rendering,"<ul><li>Anything that's been interpreted in an artistic form is a rendering — a song, a drawing, a theatrical performance.</li><li>On a more technical note, an architect's drawing or plan is known as a rendering. While we're still architect-related, the coat of stucco placed over the surface of a masonry wall can be a rendering as well. Rendering can also represent the giving of something, as in Gandhi's famous quote, that ""We win justice quickest by rendering justice to the other party."" Don't associate rendering with the verb rend — which means quite the opposite — ""to break apart or destroy.""</li></ul>"
renowned,"<ul><li>Celebrated, gushed over, and even legendary, something that's renowned is really famous. If you not only find a cure for cancer, but you also go on lots of talk shows so everyone knows who you are, then you'll be a renowned scientist.</li><li>Renown comes from the Anglo-Norman for ""re-name,"" as in repeatedly name, so something is renowned is something that people are talking about, or naming, over and over. If you are a huge celebrity, people from your home town might boast, ""The renowned Madame X was born here."" Something renowned is really good, not just famous. Just because you make the cover of a trashy tabloid magazine doesn't mean you're a renowned actress. But if you win an Oscar, you are.</li></ul>"
repercussion,"<ul><li>A repercussion is something that happens because of another action. You could quit paying your rent, but getting evicted from your apartment might be the repercussion.</li><li>Repercussion may remind you slightly of concussion or percussion — what they all have in common is the idea of something (a head, a drum) getting hit. With repercussion, the hitting is the action, and the result (i.e., the repercussion) is like hearing an echo of that original strike over and over as it reverberates through the air.</li></ul>"
replenish,"<ul><li>To replenish something is to refill it. If you have a pet pooch, you’re probably obligated to replenish his food bowl to avoid being barked at incessantly.</li><li>Use replenish when talking about something valuable or desirable, such as money or food. For example, you might discuss replenishing your bank account, but you wouldn’t speak of replenishing a trash can. You can also use replenish in a joking way to show that something is of value to you; by noting that the jar of jellybeans on your desk needs to be replenished, you indicate that you require jellybeans to survive your day at the office. We get that.</li></ul>"
replica,"<ul><li>A replica of something is a close — sometimes exact — likeness. The ""Mona Lisa"" that you bought at the department store is not the original but a replica of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Sorry, but you can always take it back.</li><li>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, a replica is pure adulation. Someone creating a replica is creating an imitation of the original. The word first appeared in 17th-century Italy, taking its meaning from the word replicare, ""to reply or repeat,"" as used in music. In time, it came to mean a copy, often of a work of art. In a stricter sense, the word refers to a copy created or supervised by the artist of the original work.</li></ul>"
repudiate,"<ul><li>To repudiate something is to reject it, or to refuse to accept or support it. If you grow up religious, but repudiate all organized religion as an adult, you might start spending holidays at the movies, or just going to work.</li><li>This verb usually refers to rejecting something that has authority, such as a legal contract, doctrine, or claim. In connection with debts or other obligations, repudiate is used in the specialized sense ""to refuse to recognize or pay."" If referring to a child or a romantic parner, repudiate is used in the sense ""to disown, cast off."" This verb is derived from Latin repudiare, ""to put away, divorce.""</li></ul>"
reputation,"<ul><li>Your reputation is the general belief or opinion that other people have about you. If you are considered trustworthy and kind, you have a good reputation.</li><li>Reputation comes from the Latin word reputationem, which means ""consideration."" It's how people consider, or label, you — good or bad. The noun reputation can also mean ""being known for having a specific skill or characteristic."" For example, if you have a reputation in snow shoveling, your phone will soon be ringing off the hook with your lazy neighbors calling.</li></ul>"
resemble,"<ul><li>Have you noticed that many pet owners resemble their pets? Or is it that pets resemble their owners? Either way, it’s downright strange how they often look alike.</li><li>Derived from the old French word sembler, “to appear,” the verb resemble can imply a whole spectrum of likeness. For example, you might closely resemble your schnauzer or, hopefully, only vaguely resemble each other. It’s not just about appearance, either. This concept can include all kinds of characteristics. Two companies can resemble each other and the same could be said of two philosophies.</li></ul>"
reserve,"<ul><li>As a noun, reserve refers to the quality of a shy or modest person who doesn’t easily express his or her feelings. As a verb, to reserve is to stash something away or to set it aside for future use.</li><li>Reserve can also refer to backup supplies or resources. If a military is running out of ammunition or food, they may have to dig into the reserve to replenish their supplies. Reserve is also used as a verb to mean ""obtain in advance."" If you’re expecting a big crowd at your sister's dance recital, you might show up early to reserve seats for your family members. You could also reserve a table at a restaurant for dinner after the show.</li></ul>"
resident,"<ul><li>A resident is someone who lives somewhere particular, or a doctor-in-training who takes care of the patients at a hospital under the supervision of other doctors.</li><li>You are a resident of wherever you live — your house, town, planet. (Let's assume we're all residents of Earth.) It's where you were born or where you've lived for awhile. Doctors who have their medical licenses but need more training become residents of hospitals. Animals that don't migrate are residents, too. Although it's usually a noun, it can be an adjective, like in the horror movie no one wants to live in, ""Resident Evil.""</li></ul>"
residual,"<ul><li>Residual describes what remains after most of something is gone. It’s an almost formal word for what’s leftover. If you’ve gotten over your breakup but you still have the urge to kick your ex, then you have some residual bitterness.</li><li>Residual comes from the Old French root word residu, which means ""a remainder."" That's why residual can be something that is left behind, like the residual grime on your kitchen counter from wiping it with a dirty sponge or residual feelings of guilt that remain after you dumped your girlfriend because you were rude. A residual is also a payment to a performer, writer, or director of a television show every time the commercial airs; it’s a kind of royalty.</li></ul>"
resilient,"<ul><li>When something is strong and able to recover from damage quickly, call it resilient. If you're rough on your toys, the ones that don't break are resilient.</li><li>Formed from the Latin verb resilire, ""to leap back,"" a resilient person is able to recover from an illness or a bad experience quickly. Politicians who are resilient to media criticism do not let critical journalists affect their focus, performance, or relationship to their constituents. An object that is bent or stretched and returns to its original shape quickly is also resilient.</li></ul>"
respective,"<ul><li>When two people each have something of their own, it's their respective thing. In a boxing match, the opponents each start in their respective or individual corners.</li><li>Respective comes from the Latin respectivus meaning ""having regard for."" Everyone has regard for what's respectively theirs.  We have respective opinions, respective responsibilities, respective anxieties. It's basically another word for individual. Each of a set of twins probably has his respective bed, even though they might share a bedroom together.</li></ul>"
respectively,"<ul><li>Respectively is used to indicate order, like if you said ""Michael Phelps and Michael Jordan excelled in swimming and basketball, respectively.""</li><li>You can think of respectively as a word that lines things up in order so they match. You might say that pizza and meatloaf are your favorite and least favorite foods, respectively. If you and your sister were voted Most Improved and MVP in a baseball league, respectively, then you got better and your sister was the best. This word doesn't have much to do with respect, but it is respectful to write clearly, and respectively helps with that.</li></ul>"
restricted,"<ul><li>Have you ever seen a door labeled Restricted? If so, you probably know it means ""Stay out."" A restricted area can only be entered by certain people.</li><li>Anything labeled restricted is not public. Restricted things are private, and only certain people who are authorized can access or use those things. Anything restricted is subject to more rules. In sports, a restricted free agent has to worry about more rules than an unrestricted free agent. Something or someone restricted has to deal with restrictions, which are rules or laws that set limits.</li></ul>"
resume&nbsp;,
retain,"<ul><li>Retain means to hold on to or keep. People who can retain a lot of information are often mistaken for geniuses, but really they just have very good memories.</li><li>To retain is to keep or maintain, whether in mind, possession or a certain condition. If you have a great personal assistant, you'll probably want to retain him for as long as you can. If your body is retaining water you might look a little plump. The verbs restrain and detain sound similar, but they mean to keep something by force.</li></ul>"
retreat,"<ul><li>The noun retreat means a place you can go to be alone, to get away from it all. A spot under a shady tree might be your favorite retreat from the sun, or your bedroom in the basement may serve as a retreat from your siblings.</li><li>In the military sense, the noun retreat means the withdrawal of troops. The British retreat after the Battles of Lexington and Concord gave the American colonists an early taste of victory during the American Revolution. As a verb, retreat means to back out of something — like a lawyer who is forced to retreat from his argument when the opposing evidence is too convincing.</li></ul>"
retrieve,"<ul><li>When you retrieve something, you bring it back. Lots of dogs love to retrieve tennis balls, bringing them back to you over and over again.</li><li>You might retrieve your cell phone from the car, or the toys a baby throws repeatedly on the floor. You can also retrieve a memory from the recesses of your mind, or struggle to remember someone's name and then suddenly retrieve it. A retriever is a dog that's bred to bring things back — in fact, this is the word's earliest use, from the fifteenth century. The Old French root is retreuver, ""find again,"" from re-, ""again,"" and trouver, ""to find.""</li></ul>"
retrospect,"<ul><li>In retrospect — that is, in looking back and contemplating the past — we sometimes find ourselves wishing that we had done some things differently.</li><li>Though this word most commonly appears as a noun in the phrase ""in retrospect,"" it can also be used as a verb. The prefix retro- means “back,"" and spect is a component of the words inspect, spectator, spectacles, and perspective, among others, which all have to do with looking or seeing. So it makes sense that retrospect means to look back in time, or to remember.</li></ul>"
reveal,"<ul><li>When you make something visible or make it public information, you reveal it. For example, if you want to plan a picnic, wait until forecasters reveal the weather that is predicted.</li><li>The verb reveal comes from the Latin word revelare meaning ""unveil,"" like when you take off your hat to reveal your new haircut, or when you reveal information about your past that will shock or amuse your friends. You might also be familiar with the noun form of reveal, makeover show-speak for the moment viewers see the newly renovated room or someone's dramatic new look, as in saving the reveal for the end of the show so people keep watching.</li></ul>"
revenue,"<ul><li>Revenue is money earned by a business, or income received by the government from taxes. The government is always interested in dreaming up new sources of revenue, and so is the average head of a company unless she doesn't want to be the head anymore.</li><li>Revenue is from a French word meaning ""to return or come back,"" and dollar returns are always a welcome thing. Declining advertising revenue will doom your website, no matter how great it is. If your lemonade stand is not making a profit, you might consider lowering costs. Maybe you could get cheaper lemonade mix? Or you might look for more creative and exciting ways to increase revenue––like raiding the pantry for cookies you can sell as well.</li></ul>"
revival,"<ul><li>If something experiences a revival, that means it’s once again popular or important. If a news story mentions a revival in the technology industry, that means the industry, having gone through a slump, is once again thriving.</li><li>Revival literally means ""come back to life."" An ER doctor might perform a revival of someone whose heart has stopped. We usually use it to mean ""returned to glory, importance, or strength."" Fresh paint and new flowerbeds might mean your neighborhood is experiencing a revival. If you don't like spiky hair, you may cringe at the revival of the mohawk in fashion magazines. Revival has a religious sense too, referring to a meeting that reawakens religious excitement and passion.</li></ul>"
revive,"<ul><li>To revive something is to provide it with new energy or life, like when you revive a drooping plant by watering it, or when you revive a boring party by breaking out the karaoke machine.</li><li>Revive comes from the Latin roots re-, meaning “again,” and vivere, meaning “to live.” So, the word revive means “live again.”  While the possibility of bringing folks back from the dead isn’t something we’re qualified to comment on, we will note that revive can be used in a sense that’s very close to its literal meaning; specifically, revive can mean “cause someone to regain consciousness.”</li></ul>"
revolution,"<ul><li>When a new development in an industry changes everything drastically, call it a revolution. The Internet has certainly caused a revolution in the way people lead their lives.</li><li>Stemming from the Latin revolvere ""to turn, roll back,"" revolution originally referred to the circuit of the stars through the sky. Today, it still means circuit when talking about the RPM, or revolutions per minute, in an engine. A revolution is also a drastic change in a field such as the fashion industry or technology, or similarly, a sudden, often violent uprising from the people to change the political system.</li></ul>"
revolutionize,"<ul><li>Revolutionize, a verb, means ""to make a major change,"" like in the 1990s, when the Internet revolutionized how people communicated, got information and even did their jobs. Things were never the same again.</li><li>Use revolutionize to describe something that is completely transformed. Originally, it meant ""to bring about sweeping political change,"" like people who band together and fight to revolutionize a nation, with the end result being a new party in power or new philosophies about things like land ownership or tax collection put in place. In time, it also came to mean even nonpolitical change, like the digital music player, which revolutionized how people get and listen to music.</li></ul>"
rigidly,
rigorous,"<ul><li>If you are rigorous when you do something, you do it extremely carefully and precisely. A rigorous inspection of your tax records has revealed the government owes you money. Congratulations!</li><li>The Latin root for rigorous is rigor, meaning “stiffness.” This might remind you of rigor mortis, the stiffening of a body after death, as often seen on cop shows. This is a good, if creepy, way of remembering the meaning of rigorous: rigorous people are stiff and unbending about the standards of their work. This requires being alive, of course.</li></ul>"
rigor,"<ul><li>When a school boasts of its academic rigor, it means its students learn a lot and work really hard. Rigor means thoroughness and exhaustiveness — the gold standard for a good teacher.</li><li>You may have heard of ""rigor mortis"" — which is a medical term describing the stiffness of a body after death. Another meaning of rigor is ""sternness or severity"" — for many, the rigors of boot camp are not easy to endure.</li></ul>"
rise,"<ul><li>Rise almost always has to do with something that’s becoming taller or higher, like when you rise from your chair or your grades that rise when you study harder.</li><li>As a verb, rise can mean anything from ""get up"" to ""increase"" to ""rebel"" to ""return from the dead."" As a noun, it can be an upward movement, a little hill, a wage increase, a price hike, or even the length from the waistband to the center seam on a pair of jeans — with a low rise, those fashionable jeans don't cover much of your mid-section, which is why denim shopping with Mom can make anger rise in both of you!</li></ul>"
risk,"<ul><li>A risk is an action that holds a chance of danger or failure. Although it's fun jump around on glaciers, the risk of falling down a crack into a freezing lake might deter you from ice climbing.</li><li>Risk comes from the French for danger. As nouns, risk and danger are close synonyms. The verb risk means to run a danger, in hopes of reward. So risk is similar to gamble. If you're very ill, you might risk a dangerous surgery. We also use risk for money or security. You can risk your good health by working with infected patients without sterile equipment. Or you can risk your life savings on the stock market.</li></ul>"
ritual,"<ul><li>A ritual is a ceremony or action performed in a customary way. Your family might have a Saturday night ritual of eating a big spaghetti dinner and then taking a long walk to the ice cream shop.</li><li>As an adjective, ritual means ""conforming to religious rites,"" which are the sacred, customary ways of celebrating a religion or culture. Different communities have different ritual practices, like meditation in Buddhism, or baptism in Christianity. We also call the ceremony itself a ritual. Although it comes from religious ceremonies, ritual can also be used for any time-honored tradition, like the Superbowl, or Mardi Gras, or Sunday morning pancake breakfast.</li></ul>"
rival,"<ul><li>A rival is a competitor or contender that you want to defeat, whether in an actual competition or for another goal. It may be a tennis rival or a rival for your true love’s affections.</li><li>There are all types of rivals, but they tend to show up a lot in sports. For example, in college football, the Army and Navy have been rivals since their first meeting in 1890. Something that is able to rival something else is seen as comparable to it in quality, and something that is said to be “without rival” is unmatched, or better than everything else.</li></ul>"
roam,"<ul><li>When you wander without a plan or a specific destination, you roam. Your cat may stay close to your house when you let her outside, or she may roam around the neighborhood all day.</li><li>Dogs and kids on bikes tend to roam in packs, looking for food or fun, while a tiger in the zoo roams aimlessly around his enclosure. Book characters' eyes sometimes roam, too, or glance over a scene without stopping: ""Her eyes roam across the group, but there are no familiar faces."" Experts have tried connecting roam to ""pilgrimages to Rome,"" but there seems to be no relation between roam and Rome.</li></ul>"
robust,"<ul><li>Use robust to describe a person or thing that is healthy and strong, or strongly built. This adjective also commonly describes food or drink: a robust wine has a rich, strong flavor.</li><li>If your school has a robust sports program, it means they offer lots of different kinds of sports and that a lot of kids participate. If you have a robust speaking voice, it means you have a voice that's deep and loud and strong. Robust is from Latin robustus ""of oak, hard, strong,"" from robur ""oak tree, strength.""</li></ul>"
role,"<ul><li>A role is a part you play. In school, you might take on the role of clown, in your family, the role of the responsible one, on stage, the role of Juliet.</li><li>Role can also mean job or function. It is the role of the police to keep the community safe, and  political parties often argue about the role government should play in our lives. Roles can also be played by things. You can say that computers play an increasing role in our day-to-day lives and that the role of a hat is to keep your head warm. You look up to your role model because of the important role that they play in influencing others' lives.</li></ul>"
rotate,"<ul><li>Rotate means to circle around a center point. Wheels on a car rotate, planets rotate, and if you're an ice skater, you rotate on the blade of a skate when you do your spins.</li><li>Rotate can also mean that you take turns performing a job. If you, Jim, and Shelia all got the same amount of votes in the class election, you could rotate the role of treasurer, meaning the position would pass from one to another in a regular pattern. Rotate can also refer to other things that are passed along in a regular order. You might rotate lawn duties with your brother — that means you mow the lawn one week and he mows it the next.</li></ul>"
roughly,
roundabout,"<ul><li>A roundabout is an intersection that uses a circular junction instead of stoplights or stop signs to manage traffic flow. Instead of every car stopping, they enter the roundabout slowly, and traffic moves almost continuously.</li><li>In the UK, an amusement park ride that moves in a circle, like a carousel, is also a roundabout, but in North America this noun almost always means what's sometimes called a ""traffic circle"" or a ""rotary."" As an adjective, roundabout describes things that aren't straightforward, but are indirect or unclear: ""After his roundabout confession, I'm not even sure he realizes what he did wrong.""</li></ul>"
route,"<ul><li>A route is a way for travel or movement, the path from point A to point B. A route can also be the method used for achieving a particular result, like going to school and working hard is your route to success.</li><li>Route comes from an Old French word, rute, “road,” “way,” or “path” and the Latin rupta, “broken way” or “beaten way.” A route can be a highway, like Route 66, or all the places you pass through on the way somewhere, like using a map to find the shortest route. As a verb, route means ""to send people or things on a particular course,"" like detour signs that route you through unfamiliar streets or a package that is routed through Cleveland on its way to you.</li></ul>"
routinely,"<ul><li>When you do something routinely, you do it often and regularly. Many people routinely brush their teeth before they go to bed and again when they wake up in the morning.</li><li>Something that's become a habit or an often repeated series of actions is done routinely. Your actual daily routine is one example of this — you might routinely eat cereal for breakfast, or routinely feed your cat at 5:00, for example. You can also say that a movie critic who always seems to find some fault with a film routinely trashes all your favorite movies. The French root is routine, ""usual course of action,"" from route, ""way or path.""</li></ul>"
rudiment,"<ul><li>Rudiment, usually used in the plural, means the basics. If you know the alphabet, you have the rudiments of reading at your disposal.</li><li>You might learn the rudiments of cooking from your mother, but you won't become an expert until you spend time in your own kitchen. In biology, the word rudiment means an undeveloped part of an organ or limb, like you would find in an embryo or fetus.</li></ul>"
rudimentary,"<ul><li>Rudimentary means basic, or at a very early stage. The test should be easy: it requires only a rudimentary understanding of the materials.</li><li>The word rude means simple or offensive — and people with only rudimentary understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is rude. If you remember that the word rude is the foundation of rudimentary, you'll have a rudimentary understanding of the word.</li></ul>"
sacred,"<ul><li>Something sacred is holy, devoted to a religious ceremony, or simply worthy of awe and respect. Jerusalem is a sacred place for many religions, just as Fenway is a sacred place for Red Sox fans.</li><li>Sacred is an adjective used to describe a person or thing worthy of worship or declared holy. It usually appears in a religious context, but an object or place set aside for a particular purpose can also be sacred. Sacred spaces and items are intended to be treated with care and respect — even if it's just your shrine to Brad Pitt.</li></ul>"
sample,"<ul><li>A sample is a small part of something that either represents a bigger whole or is designed to let you try something out. You might ask to try a sample of an exotic ice cream flavor before committing to buying a whole cone.</li><li>Sample comes from the Old French essample, meaning ""example."" In social science experiments, researchers try to find a sample of people to study that is representative of the intended population as a whole. At the grocery store, you might be given a sample of peanut butter on a little cracker to entice you to buy it. In that case, you are given the chance to sample, or taste, the product.</li></ul>"
satisfied,"<ul><li>If you’re satisfied, you’re contented, and you don’t need anything more. You're not overjoyed, but you're not complaining either.</li><li>When something is satisfied, the requirements have been met and nothing more needs to be done. When you pay back the money you owe on a loan, you have satisfied the debt. If you just had a delicious meal, your hunger is probably satisfied. If you’re an outlaw cowboy and your partner double crosses you, you won’t be satisfied until you’ve run him out of town.</li></ul>"
save for,
scale,"<ul><li>A scale is a series that climbs up or down. Think of scaling, or climbing, a mountain; a musical scale: do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do; or a scale you weigh yourself on––it counts up the pounds one after another after another.</li><li>Scale can be a ratio too––when maps are drawn ""to scale,"" that means one mile of real road might translate to one inch of road on the map. Even fish scales can be understood this way––they repeat the same shape row after row after row. You can also rate something using a scale: ""How much do you love pizza? Rate it on a scale of one to ten, with one being blech and ten being amazing.""</li></ul>"
scant,"<ul><li>Scant is an adjective that means ""a tiny amount,"" like your scant attendance at practice this week that results in being benched from the big game.</li><li>Scant is also a verb, that means ""to supply sparingly"" — don't scant with the brownies, or I will keep asking for more. Scant also means ""to deal with inadequately or carelessly."" When you scant the reports on homelessness, they are so superficial on data that they don't reflect the real problem. Scant comes from the Old Norse word skamt, meaning ""short, brief.""</li></ul>"
scanty,"<ul><li>We refer to an amount or thing that is not quite enough as scanty, or lacking. It's an adjective used to describe something that doesn't offer enough, as in ""farmers having a scanty crop in a drought year.""</li><li>The adjective scanty comes from the Old Norse scamt, which means ""short or brief,"" and so suggests a small amount. The word usually suggests a meager amount, and can refer to anything that is barely sufficient. Someone trying to stretch a meal might offer scanty servings. On a humorous note, a Roaring Twenties flapper referred to her underwear as scanties.</li></ul>"
scatter,"<ul><li>If you hear someone shout ""Everybody scatter!” that person wants everyone to spread out and leave the area. Scatter is a verb that means ""to separate suddenly and spread out in different directions.""</li><li>Scatter is sometimes used as a noun to refer to something that has been scattered. If you have clothes strewn all over your room, you might say there is a scatter of clothes on the floor. More commonly, though, scatter is used as a verb meaning “to spread about.” You might scatter grass seed on your front lawn in the spring. Scatter can also mean “break up or disperse.” The police, for instance, might scatter an unruly mob or gathering.</li></ul>"
scenario,"<ul><li>A scenario is a specific possibility. To plan on playing with a bunch of bear cubs is a scenario — a dumb one, but still a scenario.</li><li>When people are wondering what to do, they think of different scenarios. Moving to a big city is one scenario — moving to a tiny town is another. A football team has to plan for many scenarios, like the starting quarterback being injured. The government plans for hundreds of scenarios, such as natural disasters and attacks by terrorists. In literature, a scenario can mean a summing up of what's going on — what the situation is. A scenario is pretty similar to a situation, but a scenario hasn't happened yet and might not happen at all.</li></ul>"
scented,
scope,"<ul><li>Business people like to use the word scope because it specifies the extent of their responsibilities. Once you know the scope of a project, you can decide if you're qualified and how much time it will take to do it.</li><li>If your boss gives you a new task and you don't want to do it, tell him or her it's not within the scope of your duties. A scope is also a device used to see something in the distance.  You'll find one on shotguns, submarines, radars and the like. You can use scope as a verb meaning ""to look out or around."" When you and your friends go out, you probably scope out a few places to see where the action is.</li></ul>"
scorching,"<ul><li>Use the adjective scorching to mean extremely hot. The scorching heat from a wildfire tar on roads and char nearby houses and trees.</li><li>There's a huge difference between a warm day and a scorching one; the word implies a brutal heat. If the weather is scorching, you'll be desperate for air conditioning, iced drinks, or the relief of a cold shower. You can also use it to mean ""harsh,"" like a critic's scorching review of a really terrible movie. Etymologists suspect that scorching is derived from the Old Norse skorpna, ""to be shriveled.""</li></ul>"
score,"<ul><li>When you're playing a game, your score is the number of points you have. If the score of a basketball game is 34 to 34, it means both teams have 34 points — the score is tied.</li><li>To score in a game is to achieve points or goals. In school, you get a score, or a grade, on your tests and papers. Another kind of score is the written part of a musical composition. And when someone asks, ""What's the score?"" they might also mean ""What's going on?"" The Gettysburg Address famously begins, ""Four score and seven years ago..."" In this case, a score is ""twenty,"" from the Old English scoru, also ""twenty.""</li></ul>"
scorn,"<ul><li>Scorn is open disrespect for someone or something. It can also be disrespect coupled with feelings of intense dislike.</li><li>The noun scorn describes your feelings of disdain when you encounter something you view as worthless or inferior — like, for instance, a talk show that gets all its facts wrong. Use the verb form for those times when you’re actively expressing scorn. You might scorn a politician who spends $100,000 on travel while claiming to work hard promoting middle-class values.</li></ul>"
scrap,"<ul><li>A scrap is a little leftover bit of something. You might jot down notes on a scrap of paper, or you might toss a scrap of food to your happy dog.</li><li>A scrap is typically a small item that originally was part of something larger, like a scrap of fabric that was once part of a larger piece. Scrap can also describe something that’s no longer useful. For example, you might take scrap metal to the recycling center. A final meaning of the noun scrap is ""fight,"" as in ""I got into a scrap with my brother."" Scrap also has a verb form that means ""discard."" When you scrap your plan to move to the Bahamas, that means you’re abandoning the plan.</li></ul>"
screen,
scrutinize,"<ul><li>If you want to examine something closely and go over every single detail, then you should scrutinize it. Like the way your mom probably assesses your outfit before you leave the house for school.</li><li>Scrutinizing is very different from glancing or gazing. It's even more than a long, hard look. To scrutinize something, you have to look at it really critically, investigating every nook and cranny. Often things are scrutinized to verify if they're correct or authentic. So it makes perfect sense that this verb is rooted in the Latin word scrutari, which means “to search.”</li></ul>"
scrutiny,"<ul><li>Scrutiny is when you look at something really closely, like when you are checking a test for mistakes. Scrutiny can also be an intense look, like when your mother looks at you — trying to tell if you might be lying.</li><li>Scrutiny comes from the Latin scrutari, which means “to search,” but which originally meant, “to sort trash.” When you turn in a draft of your essay, you are subjecting it to your teacher's scrutiny — and there's a good chance that she'll find some sentences that can be ""trashed"" as well as sections that could be improved.</li></ul>"
sculpt,"<ul><li>To sculpt is to shape or carve a figure out of a moldable or hard material. You could sculpt a figure of your mom's cat or you could sculpt your biceps by lifting weights.</li><li>Artists who sculpt are called sculptors, and the work of art they make is called a sculpture. You can sculpt out of wood or stone, by carving, or sculpt clay by molding and shaping. You can sculpt metal by heating it and pouring it into molds, or by welding pieces of it together. It's even possible to sculpt with balloons, twisting them into complicated structures or figures.</li></ul>"
secrete,"<ul><li>Secrete is all about secrets. It means both ""to hide"" and ""to release."" When you squeeze a lemon, it secretes juice. When you stuff your money in a mattress, you secrete it there.</li><li>It's easy to remember that secrete's all about secrets when you see the word secret inside secrete. Imagine the first person who squeezed a lemon and secreted the juice. Probably felt like he'd discovered a secret stash of citrus goodness. If he was greedy, maybe he gathered all the lemons he could find and secreted them away in a box so no one else would learn the secret of the juice-secretion.</li></ul>"
sedentary,"<ul><li>Scientists believe that one of the causes of the obesity epidemic sweeping the U.S. is our sedentary lifestyle. Sedentary means sitting a lot and refers to a person or job that is not very physically active.</li><li>If you have a sedentary job, you might want to stand up and stretch every hour or so, and if your doctor says that you are too sedentary, she means that it would be healthier for you to exercise more. This adjective has a specialized meaning when referring to certain types of birds that stay in one area and do not migrate. Sedentary comes into English from French sédentaire, which is derived from the Latin word sedēre, ""to sit.""</li></ul>"
seek,"<ul><li>If you seek an accordion player for your new polka band, it means you are looking for a band mate.</li><li>When you seek something, you try to find it. It's possible to seek fame, or snacks, or a college degree, or approval — as long as you're looking for it, or longing for it, you're seeking it. The origins of the word seek go back to the Latin word sagire, which means ""to perceive keenly by scent."" Imagine a dog tracking a rabbit, sniffing the ground and following its scent, and you'll know exactly what it means to seek something.</li></ul>"
seething,"<ul><li>Seething describes anger you can barely contain. If you are seething and something sets you off, you just might explode into a rage.</li><li>Someone who's seething with anger is furious but keeping it a secret. Maybe someone insulted you in front of others and you want to let it go — on the inside, though, you might be seething. Or during the big game, an opponent's harsh words can have you seething, but you want to stay focused on scoring points. Seething sometimes describes something that's boiling over, like a seething pot of soup, and this is also the root of the word.</li></ul>"
segment,"<ul><li>A segment is one of several pieces that together create a whole. You could offer a segment of your orange to your girlfriend as a Valentine's Day gift. She’ll probably enjoy the orange, but she may break up with you.</li><li>Lots of things can have segments. You can talk about a segment of a talk show, a segment of a sphere, or the segment of students in your high school who want to join the Drama Club — the ones singing and dancing in the cafeteria every day. You can also use segment as a verb: when you chop down that oak tree in your front yard, you have to segment the trunk into smaller pieces for firewood.</li></ul>"
seize,"<ul><li>Infomercial salesmen constantly tell you to seize the opportunity to buy their product while you still can. Supplies are limited! After all, everyone will want that solar-powered puppy petter, so you'd better grab the opportunity and buy two!</li><li>You can seize all kinds of things. Seize the day if you are taking advantage of the present circumstances and enjoying life to the fullest. Seize the castle, if you are a feudal lord fighting with your neighbor. Seize the inspiration if you want to tell a moving story. Seize authority if you are overthrowing a small country. Avoid, at all costs, being seized if you are under zombie attack.</li></ul>"
seldom,"<ul><li>If you seldom see your grandmother because she lives far away, you might be grateful for the opportunity to visit her over the summer. Use the adjective seldom to refer to things that don't happen very often.</li><li>A near synonym is rarely. Seldom is a Middle English word, from Old English seldum, a spelling alteration of seldan ""strange, rare."" In Old English, the spelling seldum came about by analogy with forms such as Old English hwilum ""formerly, at one time,"" from hwil ""time, while.""</li></ul>"
sensational,"<ul><li>Something sensational gets your attention. It's either amazing or a little trashy — like a sensational tabloid story.</li><li>Sensational things cause quite a sensation — usually a feeling of curiosity or interest. Sensational events and sensational people keep you watching and listening. A guy juggling seven flaming bowling balls is sensational. A super popular new song is sensational. But this word does have some negative connotations, as it often describes news stories that have little merit other than their shock value. ""Sexy Starlet Visits Fertility Clinic!"" is a trashy kind of sensational headline.</li></ul>"
separate,"<ul><li>Things that are separate are kept apart from other things. A married couple heading for divorce might eat breakfast at separate tables.</li><li>You can use the adjective separate to describe something that is thought of as different or not related to other things. The adjective is from the Latin prefix se- ""apart"" plus parare ""to prepare."" Separate is also used as a verb, pronounced ""SEP-uh-rate."" Separate is one of the most commonly misspelled words, so beware of the erroneous spelling, seperate.</li></ul>"
sequence,"<ul><li>When things come in sequence, they come in a specific order. It could be a chronological sequence, a sequence following a pattern (red-blue-brown, red-blue-brown), or a cause-and-effect sequence.</li><li>Sequence can also be a verb. When you sequence something, you put it in order. The prom committee had the task of sequencing dance music––even if playing ""Celebrate"" as the final dance and not the first felt out of sequence to the DJ, it was their call.</li></ul>"
sequent,
serene,"<ul><li>Choose the adjective serene to describe someone who is calm and untroubled. If you tell someone horrible news and they remain serene, you might wonder if they heard you!</li><li>Related to the Latin word serenus ""peaceful, calm, clear,"" serene was originally used in English, as in Latin, to describe calm weather. By the mid 1600s, however, it was used figuratively to describe a calm, untroubled person as well. Though people show their emotions pretty openly today, Victorian novels are full of characters who remain serene no matter how terrible the news.</li></ul>"
set in,
set off,
setback,"<ul><li>A setback is an event that makes you lose progress or keeps you from gaining ground. If you're knitting a sweater, dropping a bunch of stitches would be a big setback.</li><li>If warring countries are negotiating a treaty, a sudden resurgence of fighting would be a huge setback for their peace plan. And if you're trying to finish baking in time for you friend's birthday party, knocking the frosted cake onto the floor would also be a setback. Setbacks are always frustrating — unless you're talking about the kind of setback that's defined as ""a building's distance from the street.""</li></ul>"
settle,"<ul><li>To settle means to come to order or rest, much as snow settles on the ground or dust settles on the dining room table.</li><li>Settle has a number of meanings. After moving several times, you'll wish your parents would settle in one place for the rest of your school years. Have you ever heard your house creaking or groaning? That's the house settling. When adults tell children to calm down, they'll often say, ""Settle down kids!"" And as a legal term, you settle a lawsuit when the accuser and the accused come to an agreement without going to court.</li></ul>"
severe,"<ul><li>Whether you're talking about a punishment, the weather, or how bad your flu is, severe indicates that it's at the limit of the spectrum.</li><li>The austerity of a word like severe serves many purposes. The common usage is to describe tough or painful stuff, like icy snowstorms, merciless punishments, or grim conditions (e.g., a severe depression). If things are severe, they're serious. Severe could also describe a person's haircut if it's brutally short and angular, or their wardrobe if it tends to be all black with no flourishes.</li></ul>"
severed,
severity,"<ul><li>Severity is a plain, no-frills hardness––or the degree of hardness. You might talk about the severity of the northern winter, or the severity of your grandfather's discipline.</li><li>Severity, with its root in severe, has several nuances. It can mean a hardship, like war’s severity. It also refers to an extreme plainness. Think of the severity of Amish life: no phones, cars, or other modern technology. And you might use it to describe your math teacher’s manner: his severity is indicated by his short, clipped sentences, angry stare, and propensity to fail students without mercy.</li></ul>"
shallow,"<ul><li>The adjective shallow can describe things that aren't very deep, like a shallow puddle, or people who don't have much emotional or intellectual depth, like shallow people who judge others on their looks and how much money they have.</li><li>Shallow likely comes from the Old English word sceald, which means ""shoal,"" the water near a shoreline. So, shallow describes something that is close to the surface — like the shallow roots of a newly-planted tree or a person whose interest in someone or something isn't very deep. For instance, a shallow person might go to the opening of a new art exhibition not so much to see the artworks as meet the wealthy people on the museum's board of trustees.</li></ul>"
shatter,"<ul><li>When you shatter something, you smash it or break it into small bits. If your sister hits a baseball directly into the kitchen window, the window will shatter — and your sister will be in big trouble.</li><li>When you drop something fragile, it will probably shatter—lightbulbs, teacups, mirrors, and windows all shatter fairly easily. Things can also shatter in a less literal way, when it just feels like they're breaking apart violently. If your best friend ignores you all day, your heart shatters; and if you stumble and fall on your way up to a podium to give a speech, your confidence may shatter.</li></ul>"
sheer,"<ul><li>If your curtains allow light to pass through, they're sheer, or see-through. Sheer can also describe something steep, like a cliff, or anything extreme, like sheer nerve.</li><li>This word has several meanings, but they're all extreme. You might want to layer a sheer shirt over a tank top. Climbing a sheer cliff is almost impossible. If your car sheers, it swerves sharply, and you might crash. Maybe you've met all these meanings in a single nightmare: When the sheer fabric blew over your face as you drove, you lost control and the car began to sheer, filling you with sheer terror as you went over the sheer cliff.</li></ul>"
shield,"<ul><li>A shield is a cover that protects whatever is behind or beneath it.  If you carry a shield you might be a knight, or a traffic cop who likes to flash the badge.</li><li>Ancestors of the word shield include the Old English scild, similar to sciell, or ""shell,"" which suggests the meaning of the word. If you're a turtle, you might use your shell as a shield.  But a shield doesn't have to be something physical. Philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once said, ""Love is my sword, goodness my armor, and humor my shield."" The word can also be used as a verb.  You might shield your tender ears from hearing naughty words.  Don't worry, shield is perfectly safe.</li></ul>"
shift,"<ul><li>Shift the verb and shift the noun are very similar in meaning. A shift is a change in something or an adjustment in the way something is done. You can either make a shift (that's the noun), or you can just shift (that's the verb).</li><li>What makes a shift different from, say, a change is that it implies some kind of movement; a sense that the thing that you're shifting is still the same thing, just moving in a different direction. For example, when you shift gears in a car you're simply moving from one gear to another. If you shift your focus, you're still focused, but the focus has moved. If the government shifts its policy, that policy, while different, is still a policy.</li></ul>"
shiver,"<ul><li>People shiver, or shake and tremble, when they're very cold. You might shiver in the snow if you forget to wear your winter coat.</li><li>While you are most likely to shiver in the cold, you might also shiver from excitement or even fear. The involuntary shudder our bodies make in chilly weather is a response meant to raise our body temperature to a safe level. Shiver was originally chiveren, from the Old English ceafl, or ""jaw."" This is thought to be connected to the chattering your teeth do when you shiver.</li></ul>"
shortage,"<ul><li>A shortage is a lack of something, especially a severe lack. A drought is a shortage of water.</li><li>When there's a shortage, there's not enough of something. If you don't have enough money to pay your bills, you have a shortage of money. A bad football team may have a shortage of good players. This kind of shortage is like a deficit or shortfall. A shortage can also be a severe dearth of something, like a famine, which is a lack of food. If there's a drought because of little rainfall, that's a serious shortage.</li></ul>"
showcase,
shrink,"<ul><li>Shrink is the informal word you can use to talk about a therapist. Talking about your problems with her can hopefully help you shrink them, or make them smaller.</li><li>The word shrink is related to the Swedish skrynka meaning ""to wrinkle."" Think about what happens to a lone forgotten fruit at the bottom of your fridge drawer. After a while, it begins to wrinkle or shrink. Clothes washed in hot water tend to shrink, so be wary of the setting on your washing machine. The use of shrink as referring to therapists started as late as the 1960s — with the idea of a psychologist being a ""head-shrinker.""</li></ul>"
shy away from,
signature,"<ul><li>When you sign your name in your own handwriting, that is your signature. Things you can put your signature on include checks, permission slips, letters, stays of execution, and declarations of independence.</li><li>Signature isn't just about signing your name on the dotted line. A characteristic mark, tune, or style is also called a signature. Perhaps you have a favorite outfit or style that you consider your signature look. ""I Did It My Way"" was a signature tune of Frank Sinatra. In music, the signature indicates what key the song is set in by showing the sharps and flats.</li></ul>"
significance,"<ul><li>Significance means having the quality of being ""significant"" — meaningful, important. It also refers to the meaning of something. A certain date might have significance because it's your birthday or the anniversary of Princess Di's wedding.</li><li>Significance starts with the word sign for a reason. An item's significance is a sign of its importance. The significance of something can be implicit or explicit — meaning it can be clear or only known with a deeper understanding of the situation. Your perfect score on the Calculus exam might have added significance for people who know that you never even opened your textbook to study.</li></ul>"
significant,"<ul><li>Use the adjective significant to describe something that is important. Your ""significant other"" means the person who's most important in your life. A significant result in a scientific study is a result large enough to matter.</li><li>A less common meaning of significant is to describe something that has a special or hidden meaning. A significant smile can convey feelings or information without words. This adjective is from Latin significans, from significare ""to signify,"" from signum ""a sign, mark"" plus facere ""to make.""</li></ul>"
simulated,"<ul><li>A simulated thing pretends to be something it’s not, like a fire drill with fake smoke.  Relax, it’s only a simulated emergency, created to feel exactly like the real thing.</li><li>Simulated and similar have the same Latin root (similis), and a simulated situation is similar to the original, like a theme park that feels like India when you’re actually in Florida.  Emotions can be simulated too, like your simulated sadness when you just want to get out of trouble.  The word implies fakeness, but not always in a bad way.  A simulated airflight video game can teach you how to fly without the negative side effects of crashing and dying.</li></ul>"
simultaneously,"<ul><li>Use the adverb simultaneously to describe actions that occur at the same time. You are reading this sentence and simultaneously learning a new word!</li><li>Simultaneously doesn’t have to describe two different actions. It just means that things are happening at the same time. If a presidential debate is broadcast simultaneously on three television channels, “broadcast” is the only action but it’s happening in three places at once.</li></ul>"
singularly,
sink,"<ul><li>When things sink, they settle or drop to a lower level. If your kayak has a leak, it might fill with water and sink to the bottom of the lake.</li><li>Things can sink, like a toy octopus descending to the bottom of the bathtub or the sun appearing to sink below the horizon. You can also deliberately sink something, as when you capsize your friend's remote controlled speedboat on purpose. When sink is a noun, it's the water basin in your kitchen or bathroom. The Old English root of both kinds of sink is sincan, ""become submerged or go under,"" from a Germanic source.</li></ul>"
site,"<ul><li>A site is a location. The leader of a Zombie Army might remind his underlings: “Your web site is just a collection of pages at one address on the Web. Your burial site is where you find more soldiers!”</li><li>Site can also refer to a specific parcel of land, such as a building site or a burial site. Although a website has no physical location, it does have a virtual one, which is reached the same way a physical location is: by going to an address.</li></ul>"
size up,"<ul><li>To size up is to evaluate or critically assess something or someone. When a chess player sizes up her competition, she makes a judgment about what kind of player she might be facing.</li><li>If you're giving a speech, it might help to size up your audience before you decide to include your infamous corny jokes. And part of what happens during a job interview is that the interviewer sizes up the applicant, attempting to figure out what kind of worker they'd be. You could also size up the sofa your brother bought, guessing whether or not it's likely to fit through the front door.</li></ul>"
skeptical,"<ul><li>If a friend told you that her family was perfect and they never had any problems, would you believe her? If not, you may be skeptical. Skeptical people look at the world with a certain amount of doubt.</li><li>This word comes from ancient Greece, where a philosopher named Pyrrho taught his followers that we can never really understand the true nature of things, only how they appear to us. (So basically, we should stop searching for the meaning of life and just relax.) In Pyrrho's view, the true sage was someone who realized that it was impossible to be certain about anything. His followers were called Skeptikoi, or Skeptics; the Greek word skeptikos means “given to asking questions.”</li></ul>"
slight,"<ul><li>Anything slight is very small. There's a slight chance you'll run into a celebrity in New York City — in other words, don't count on it. A slight is also an insult, like giving someone the cold shoulder. Burr.</li><li>Every meaning of slight stems from the Old Norse for ""small or flimsy."" If you have a slight build, you're slim with small bones. A slight deviation from your plan is a tiny adjustment. As a verb, to slight means to ignore or be indifferent toward someone; it's also the noun for the act of ignoring. If you direct a movie and the star doesn't thank you in her award acceptance speech, you'll be offended at the slight.</li></ul>"
slightly,
slope,"<ul><li>If you find yourself on a slippery slope, watch out: you could be sliding down a hill. Land that is not level is called a slope. Slope can also be a verb, as in land that slopes down to sea level.</li><li>Language experts believe the word slope came from the Middle English word aslope, an adverb that means “at an angle.” The word has a noun form you can use for something that is at an angle — on a slope — like a steep hill or the ramp in a parking garage. It also has a verb form that can be used to describe something that slants, like someone's signature with letters that slope to the left or an angled haircut that slopes to cover one eye.</li></ul>"
snaking,
snap,"<ul><li>Oh, snap! When something snaps, it breaks or separates suddenly, often with a cracking sound. A snap can also be a fastener on clothes. And if you like a song, you can snap your fingers to the beat or snap a selfie of yourself dancing.</li><li>The verb snap is useful for many things that make a similar sharp sound, like when you snap your lunchbox shut, snap your fingers, or snap a whip. An animal's quick, strong bite is also a snap. As a noun, it can mean ""fastener"" or ""the sound of a snap."" A snap judgment is a decision you make almost instantaneously, and a cold snap is a short period of bitter weather.</li></ul>"
so far,
soak,"<ul><li>To soak something is to submerge it into water. Before you cook dry beans, you soak them overnight first. If you’re not a bean, you can also soak up a cool experience by immersing yourself in it.</li><li>You can soak your dirty laundry in soapy water, or soak rice before you cook it, and you can also soak in a bubble bath. When you do this, you give these things (including yourself) a soak. Informally, the verb also means ""immerse in an activity or experience,"" like when you soak up the applause after your masterful violin performance.</li></ul>"
sole,"<ul><li>Sole means not shared with others. If it's your sole responsibility to make the chocolate cake for a party, it's all on you.</li><li>Sole comes from the Latin solus, meaning ""alone,"" and it can describe being the only person involved in something, like being the sole member of the Special People Club. As a noun, your sole is the bottom of your foot. If you order sole in a restaurant, you'll get a flat fish that looks like the bottom of your shoe. Although they sound alike, if you order the soul, the waitperson might send you to a church down the street.</li></ul>"
solicit,"<ul><li>Solicit means to ask for. It is what those people on the street are doing, when they ask, ""Do you have a moment to talk about the destruction of the planet?"" They are soliciting donations for their cause.</li><li>Solicit has an official sounding impressiveness to it––doesn't soliciting donations sound better than begging for money? It can also have a more sinister cast. ""When the teacher left the room, two girls solicited their friends to throw all the textbooks out the windows, injuring members of the cheer squad below — where they were soliciting signatures for a petition banning smoking in the football locker rooms.""</li></ul>"
solitary,"<ul><li>If you're a lone wolf, a one-man band, a rugged individualist, or an island unto yourself, you prefer to be solitary — in other words, alone or single. The term can be used to describe a person, a place, or a thing.</li><li>Solitary comes to us from the Latin solus, which means alone. Note its similarity to words like solo and, for all you card players out there, solitaire. You can take a solitary walk, during which you don't utter a solitary word, but pause to admire a solitary green shoot peeping through the snow. Solitary is also common in the prison world: Inmates on Alcatraz who were deemed too dangerous to mingle with their fellows were put in solitary confinement cells.</li></ul>"
sophisticated,"<ul><li>If something is sophisticated, it's complicated and intricate. The inner workings of a computer are sophisticated. Sophisticated can also refer to having good taste. Either way, sophisticated things are impressive.</li><li>Sophisticated systems and objects are complex and tough to understand. High school math is a lot more sophisticated than grammar school math. Driving a car is more sophisticated than riding a bike. People are sophisticated if they have plenty of worldly experience and what is generally regarded as ""good taste."" Sometimes, that just means they have a lot of money and like things that are fancy. Going to a symphony is considered more sophisticated than going to a rock concert.</li></ul>"
sophistication,"<ul><li>Sophistication is the quality that belongs to a person who appears wise and glamorous. Sipping tea and appreciating opera are both stereotypical signs of sophistication.</li><li>The noun sophistication can also be used in a slightly different way, to describe a deep understanding, or an almost enlightened state. Before the 1800s, sophistication meant ""the use of sophistry,"" or using mistaken or deceitful arguments, although the root word for both sophistication and ""sophistry"" is the Greek sophistes, or ""wise man.""</li></ul>"
sort,"<ul><li>A sort is a type or a kind of something, or the act of categorizing things. If you’re an organized sort of person, sort your clothes by color. If you’re the disorganized sort, just chuck them all over the floor.</li><li>The noun sort can mean a category or example, or even a type of person, as in ""My sister is a generous sort."" As a verb, it means ""organize, categorize, or resolve"" like when you sort your earrings by size or your math teacher helps you sort out what went wrong on the latest test. Sort comes from the Latin sortem, ""share or portion"" and also ""fate or destiny.""</li></ul>"
sought-after,
source,"<ul><li>The noun source describes an origin, like the source who gave the journalist the information that broke a new story, or the place something originates, like the source of a river, or the Web site that is your source for celebrity gossip.</li><li>The noun source can also refer to information obtained from documents, such as books, letters, newspapers, and journals. For example, when you write a research paper, you read, paraphrase and quote from sources. A source can also be a place where you get things, like a certain store being your source for discount sneakers or something that provides, like oranges, a good source of Vitamin C.</li></ul>"
span,"<ul><li>Any distance between two things is called a span. These end points can be physical, like the span of a rope between two trees, or they can be more abstract, such as the span of time between five and six o'clock.</li><li>Span comes from the Old English spann, the width of the stretched-out hand, measured from thumb to little finger. It came to refer to various other measurements, such as the distance across an arch. The first reference to a length of time came in the late 16th century, and the phrase ""attention span"" first appeared in 1922 (as ""span of attention"").</li></ul>"
span,"<ul><li>Any distance between two things is called a span. These end points can be physical, like the span of a rope between two trees, or they can be more abstract, such as the span of time between five and six o'clock.</li><li>Span comes from the Old English spann, the width of the stretched-out hand, measured from thumb to little finger. It came to refer to various other measurements, such as the distance across an arch. The first reference to a length of time came in the late 16th century, and the phrase ""attention span"" first appeared in 1922 (as ""span of attention"").</li></ul>"
spark,"<ul><li>A spark is a small, glowing particle that's either thrown off of a fire or that starts a fire. Your dad might tell everyone to stand back from the bonfire so they don't get burned by a spark.</li><li>Sparks are burning fragments that pop up off a fire, but they're also bright flashes, like the sparks of light reflecting off your sunglasses or electrical sparks given off by an engine. Some small thing that promises to grow larger is yet another kind of spark — you might notice a spark of anger within yourself when you see someone being treated unfairly, for example. The word spark comes from the Old English root spearca, ""glowing or fiery particle thrown off.""</li></ul>"
sparse,"<ul><li>Something that’s sparse is thin, not dense. If you’re looking for the perfect place to build a tree house, a sparse forest is probably not your best bet.</li><li>From the Latin sparsus, meaning “scattered,” we get the adjective sparse, which means “few and scattered.” Thinning hair is sparse, as is the population of an endangered species. Or a small and scattered crowd for an unpopular band. Synonyms include dispersed, infrequent, and scanty. Antonyms, on the other hand, include full, lush, and plentiful.</li></ul>"
spawn,"<ul><li>Technically, the mass of small eggs laid by animals like fish, frogs, mollusks is called spawn. But the word has been borrowed to mean offspring, or the act of making them in general.</li><li>When someone is in league with the devil, a preacher might refer to them as “Satan’s spawn.” Your dad probably find something satanic in the kids next door when he refers to them as the neighbor’s spawn. Bill Gates’ programming project in college spawned Microsoft, a multi-billion dollar industry giant.</li></ul>"
speak of,
speciation,"<ul><li>Speciation is the process, through evolution, that produces a new species of animal.</li><li>Reproduction creates new offspring of a species, but speciation is even more creative: it results in a species that never existed before. Biologists study speciation, often through looking at fossils and other evidence, to see exactly when and where a new species developed. Speciation is a major part of evolution, which is one theory about how life grows, develops, and changes throughout time.</li></ul>"
specific,"<ul><li>If you describe something as specific, you're signaling that you're being precise.  Say you ask your friend to meet you at a specific time and place — it means you want to meet her at, say, Ray's Pizza at 3:00 PM, not just anywhere.</li><li>Specific also means ""detailed and exact.""  That's the sense of the word that comes into play when a teacher advises you to be as specific as possible.  Indeed, specific writing paints a picture.  Say your friend Angela lives on a soybean farm in Iowa and takes Claritin for her pollen allergy.  That might not be the most interesting fact in the world, but it's a lot more interesting than saying you have a friend who lives in the Midwest and takes medicine for a problem.  If the sentence about Angela's pollen allergy is interesting at all, it's because of the specifics.</li></ul>"
specifically,"<ul><li>Specifically means particularly, or regarding one option out of several. You specifically requested that your birthday cake be chocolate with raspberry icing, so you were quite disappointed with the vanilla cake you were served instead.</li><li>The adverb specifically comes from the Latin specificus, and shares a root with special and species. If you specifically choose something, you have made a special choice about it. If you single something out specifically, it's particularly significant. A documentary about this history of childhood might have been a real eye-opener, specifically the part about how kids used to go to work at 12 or younger.</li></ul>"
specify,"<ul><li>To explicitly name something or state a particular detail, you specify that thing. So, when you have a craving for dessert and you send someone to the store to buy ice cream, you may want to specify a flavor.</li><li>If you assign something for a particular purpose, this verb means that you specify. Your parents can specify for safety's sake that you can only ride your bicycle on the sidewalk and not on the street. Another use of the verb specify is to give a set of requirements. If you have your grandmother's old recipe for snickerdoodle cookies, you may wonder what the recipe means when it specifies that you should add ""a smidgen of molasses.""</li></ul>"
spectacular,"<ul><li>Spectacular is both a noun and an adjective. The noun spectacular refers to a big, beautiful production, like a play or musical performance that has a huge cast and many dance numbers.</li><li>As an adjective, spectacular has the same quality of being over-the-top, like a spectacular restaurant with excellent food, celebrities at all the table and a gigantic waterfall along one wall. If something is spectacular, it seems like a rare feat, a real stop-and-stare moment. That's why it can also be associated with drama, or making a spectacle or scene, like a spectacular argument you witness out on the street.</li></ul>"
spectator,"<ul><li>If you're watching something, you're a spectator. Football stadiums and circus tents are full of spectators.</li><li>The spectator is a particular kind of viewer; unlike a witness or an onlooker, they usually have chosen intentionally to regard the spectacle before them. Usually the word spectator refers to people watching games or ""spectator sports,"" but you could be a spectator at any planned event. An easy way to remember this word is to think of spectacles, glasses used to view something clearly — both from the same Latin root spectare.</li></ul>"
spectrum,"<ul><li>A spectrum is a broad range of similar things or qualities, like the wide spectrum of political beliefs in this country, ranging anywhere from super conservative to über-liberal and everything in between.</li><li>Our modern definition of spectrum started out in the 1600s, when scientists used it to refer to the band of colors formed by a beam of light, like a rainbow. In physics, it’s a word that describes the distribution of something, like energy or atomic particles. We still use those scientific meanings today, but spectrum can also apply to non-science related groupings or ranges of related things.</li></ul>"
speed,"<ul><li>Speed most often describes acceleration or a high rate of motion. When something picks up too much speed, it can run off course, like a kid on a bike zooming uncontrollably down a steep hill.</li><li>Speed can be a noun or verb. As a noun, it's an indicator of pace, as in the speed of a car. As a noun, it's also a drug that keeps you awake, very awake. As a verb, it means to “move along quickly,” like how you speed around on your bike. A fun fact: while speed refers to the distance traveled by an object during a specific amount of time, velocity describes that distance, but in a specified direction.</li></ul>"
spell,"<ul><li>A spell is a series of words that has magical powers. If you’re under a spell, then what you do is out of your control — your thoughts and actions are dictated by the spell.</li><li>Spell can refer to the magic words you say, or it can describe being under the influence of those words. You probably don’t encounter many magic spells in real life, but the word is often used figuratively to describe those times when you feel like a magical power controls your action. Of course, this word can also mean the verb ""to spell"" which refers to reciting the letters in a word, like the competitive spellers in a spelling bee.</li></ul>"
sphere,"<ul><li>Marbles, oranges, bubbles, and beach balls — all of these objects illustrate the shape of a sphere, or globe (unless the beach balls are under-inflated, in which case they’re sort-of a “squished-sphere” shape).</li><li>Sphere is often used metaphorically to refer to a particular aspect or area of something. For example, unless you’re a trained circus performer, tightrope walking and fire swallowing probably lie outside of your sphere of expertise. Sphere frequently occurs in the phrase “sphere of influence,” which designates the geographical area over which a person, organization, or nation has control. In many households, whoever is in charge of the cooking controls the kitchen; so, the kitchen falls within his or her sphere of influence.</li></ul>"
splendid,"<ul><li>Looking truly magnificent today? Then someone (probably British) might stop you to say ""Wow! You look splendid, darling!"" Thanks the person, because splendid means glorious, fabulous, wonderful, and/or splendiferous.</li><li>Use the adjective splendid to describe something of the highest quality. If you're so lucky as to have someone buy you, say, a Harry Winston diamond, splendid! But splendid doesn't apply only to expensive items such as jewelry, clothing, or art. You can also have a splendid idea, morning walk, or encounter with an old friend. For some, using Splenda in their coffee instead of sugar is, for them, well, splendid!</li></ul>"
splendor,"<ul><li>The noun splendor refers to something that is magnificent or grand. If your prom was held in a luxurious ballroom with elegant decor, you might note the splendor of the setting.</li><li>The noun splendor has its roots in the Latin word splendere, which means bright. Splendid, splendiferous, and resplendent are all related adjectives used to describe grand, magnificent, and brilliant things. Splendor usually has the connotation of luxury or quality, as in ""the splendor of Balmoral castle,"" or ""the splendor of the view at the Grand Canyon.""</li></ul>"
split,"<ul><li>If you and your boyfriend split, you are no longer together. If your pants split, they come open at the seam. If both of these happen in the same day, split! (Get out of here!)</li><li>Split means to come apart or rip in two. It can be used as a verb ""let's split the apple in two"" or as a noun ""be careful to step over the split in the earth left by the quake."" It implies some violence. When firemen split open your door, they need an axe to do it.</li></ul>"
sponsor,"<ul><li>A sponsor provides support for someone or something, typically by supplying cash. Because your company is a sponsor for a homeless organization, they provide funding for the annual 5K run to raise money for the shelter.</li><li>The word sponsor stems from the Latin word spondre, meaning ""give assurance, promise solemnly."" A sponsor might support an important issue such as cancer research or education, or a sponsor might take responsibility for someone. You might be your brother's sponsor so he can join your exclusive chess group. Sponsor has a verb form to describe the action of supporting or leading something. You can sponsor a nonprofit arts organization by donating and participating on the board.</li></ul>"
spontaneous,"<ul><li>Something spontaneous happens when you're least expecting it. Spontaneous things are natural or instinctive, and they happen without warning.</li><li>If you plan to go to a movie and then you go, that's not a spontaneous thing. Ditching the movie at the last minute to go to the park? That's spontaneous. Spontaneous things happen all of a sudden, on the spur of the moment, without being planned. Spontaneous can also refer to things that happen without outside influence. Your parents will be happy if you do your chores spontaneously instead of waiting till they nag you.</li></ul>"
spontaneously,"<ul><li>When you do something spontaneously, you do it on a whim, without preparing for it or giving it much thought. If your math teacher spontaneously breaks into a tap dance, it will surprise the whole class.</li><li>Spontaneously belting out a song on the subway is very different from practicing over many weeks for a choral concert solo. Things that happen spontaneously aren't planned: improvisation in music or theater, for example, happens spontaneously. Spontaneously comes from the adjective spontaneous, with its Late Latin root spontaneus, ""willing,"" or ""of one's free will.""</li></ul>"
sporadic,"<ul><li>Sporadic is an adjective that you can use to refer to something that happens or appears often, but not constantly or regularly. The mail carrier comes every day but the plumber's visits are sporadic — he comes as needed.</li><li>A specialized use of sporadic is to describe a disease that appears only occasionally in random cases, and is therefore not an epidemic.  Mostly, though, you'll hear this word used to describe anything that happens occasionally, like your family's sporadic trips to visit your distant cousins in Ohio or the sporadic bake sales your science club sponsors when it's low on funds. English borrowed the word sporadic from Greek sporadikós, ""scattered.""</li></ul>"
sporadically,"<ul><li>Something that happens sporadically doesn't occur with regularity, but rather periodically or occasionally. You might meet sporadically with your cousins, usually on minor holidays like Memorial Day or Flag Day.</li><li>Sporadically comes from the Greek word sporadikos, meaning scattered, with the root word spora, which means sowing. Imagine sowing seed by scattering it, and you'll get the hit-or-miss sense of sporadically. There is no pattern to the frequency of an event that occurs sporadically. Working sporadically is hard because you lack a steady income and never know when you'll be busy, but traveling sporadically can be fun.</li></ul>"
spot,"<ul><li>A spot is a particular place or a small, round mark. You might pick a nice, shady spot in the woods for a picnic. But if you spot a better place by the lake, get moving!</li><li>Spots on your face might be pimples—or maybe mosquito bites you got walking in a swampy spot. Another kind of spot is a small part of something, like the bright spot in your miserable day, or the bald spot on someone’s head. Spot is also shorthand for ""spotlight"" and slang for money, as in ""He handed me a ten spot."" To spot something is to see it: ""When you spot the ice cream truck, call me!""</li></ul>"
spottily,
spread,"<ul><li>When something is spread, it's stretched or extended as far as it can go. It's a beautiful sight to see a bald eagle spread its wings and fly.</li><li>When you spread a picnic blanket on the ground, you open it and stretch it across the grass. You can also see the ocean spread out in front of you, or spread butter on toast, for example. Any way you use it, spread implies an extension across some distance, a stretching of some sort. The expression spread too thin means you are having trouble finding the time and energy to do everything in your life.</li></ul>"
spur,"<ul><li>To spur something on is to get it going, to encourage it, to hasten it or stimulate. Cowboys wear spiky metal tools called spurs on their boots to kick their horses and spur them to greater speed.</li><li>Economists talk of lowering interest rates to spur spending. A new source of funding for research will hopefully spur new proposals for research from scientists. An earthquake in China might spur cities in California to a higher standard of earthquake preparedness. You might spur your team on to victory by cheering from the sidelines.</li></ul>"
spur of the moment,
stabilize,"<ul><li>The verb stabilize means to hold steady or make firm. When you climb a ladder, you should stabilize the ladder before you get on it, otherwise you may get a lesson in the laws of gravity — you know, what goes up comes down!</li><li>The verb stabilize also means to keep from changing or shifting. If you have a fever and your temperature is all over the place, you can help stabilize it by taking aspirin. The verb stabilize was originally applied to ships and the idea that something like weight or the shape of the ship could be used to produce a steadier, or less wobbly, voyage. Now the verb applies to anything that can be made more steady or stable. You might remember how happy you were when learning to ride a bike that you had training wheels to stabilize you.</li></ul>"
staggering,"<ul><li>A staggering amount is an astonishing, astounding, stupefying amount. Anything staggering blows your mind.</li><li>If you know that stagger means to stumble around uncertainly, then you're close to the meaning of staggering: this is a word for things that are so hard to believe you might fall down when you hear them. If the President gets shot, that's staggering news. If there's a major earthquake, that's staggering. Alien life contacting the Earth would be extremely staggering. Anything that knocks your socks off or makes your mind reel is staggering.</li></ul>"
stagnation,"<ul><li>Stagnation is the state of being still, or not moving, like a sitting puddle of water where stagnation attracts mosquitoes.</li><li>The root of stagnation is the Latin word for ""standing water,"" stagnatum. The stagnation of water can be a serious problem in parts of the world where mosquitoes spread diseases like malaria, or where there is a shortage of drinkable water. There are also other kinds of stagnation, or inactivity — like a struggling country's economic stagnation or a writer's mental stagnation that results in writer's block.</li></ul>"
staple,<ul><li>Bread. Milk. Gasoline. Xboxes. What do these all have in common? They're all a staple of most people's consumption — basic products for which there will always be a demand.</li><li>Staple also has the broader more abstract sense of being anything that's popular or necessary. A staple of the political scene is partisan bickering; a staple of Broadway theater is the musical revival. And let's not forget another meaning — those handy little metal clasps that hold things together. Though most people wouldn't consider a staple a staple.</li></ul>
staunch,"<ul><li>As an adjective, staunch means firm. You might want to go to that concert Friday night, but your parents' staunch opposition prevents you.</li><li>Staunch is sometimes used as a verb to mean ""to stop the flow of a liquid,"" but most usage books will tell you it's better to use the word stanch for the verb. Think of a soldier stopping and standing still, and you will understand the connection between the two meanings. The adjectival form should make you think of ""stand,"" as in “stand firm,” or ""take a stand."" It comes from the French estanche meaning “watertight” and the Latin stanticare, which is probably from stans for “stand.”</li></ul>"
steadfast,"<ul><li>Someone who is firm and determined in a belief or a position can be called steadfast in that view, like your mom when she thinks you really shouldn’t wear that outfit.</li><li>The word steadfast traces back to the Old English word stedefæst, a combination of stede, meaning ""place,"" and fæst, meaning ""firmly fixed."" Picture a steadfast person standing firmly in place, not wavering or budging an inch, and you’ll have a good sense of what this word means. Someone can be steadfast in a belief, an effort, a plan, or even a refusal. Whatever it is, it means that the person will calmly hold firm to the chosen position and follow through with determination.</li></ul>"
steady,"<ul><li>The adjective steady describes something that is firmly fixed in position. If you have to climb up on your roof, you definitely want to have a steady ladder. Otherwise, you risk ending up in the bushes instead of on the roof.</li><li>The adjective steady can also describe something that isn't going to fluctuate wildly. If you have a steady income from a salary, you bring in approximately the same amount of money each month. If you are paid on commission, on the other hand, you may make Midas look poor in some months and beggars look rich in others. As a verb, to steady means ""to make something steady"" (big surprise): You can steady a wobbly table by sticking a matchbook under its shortest leg, or you could steady a nervous dog with a reassuring pat.</li></ul>"
stealthily,"<ul><li>If you move stealthily, you do not want to be seen or felt. A cat moves stealthily when it approaches a mouse.</li><li>Stealthily is the adverb form of stealth: Think stealth bomber, that miraculous, if flawed, creation of the American military that was supposed to escape detection, including being nearly invisible on radar. We often think of hunters as moving stealthily. They sneak up on their prey, soundlessly. Originally, the word implied that you were looking to rob or steal something, which makes sense: this term is all about being secretive and undetected. Clumsy people have trouble doing things stealthily.</li></ul>"
stem,"<ul><li>A stem is a plant's stalk, and it's also a verb meaning ""grow out of."" So roses have stems, and your idea to give roses to your mom for her birthday stems from her love of flowers.</li><li>A stem can be the central root of a word, the supporting structure of a plant, or the thin, cylindrical part of a glass goblet. When one thing stems from something else, it originates or begins growing there: ""His vegetarianism stems from his love of animals."" An older meaning of the verb is ""stop the flow of something,"" as in ""Stem your nosebleed with this tissue!"" or ""Some people think streetlights will stem the graffiti on that street.""</li></ul>"
stimulate,"<ul><li>If the economy is starting to stall, the president can't just sit there. He has to stimulate—turn it on, bring it to life, perk it up. You can stimulate practically anything: a person, a conversation, a mind, or even the growth of a plant.</li><li>Stimulate is often used to describe a physical or sexual sensation, but don't get bogged down in that kind of thinking. Often, a government will try to stimulate economic activity by creating a stimulus package. Or, say, for example, that I'm trying to sell my new song CD. In order to stimulate interest, I need to send out a sample song to all my friends. Unless, of course, my songs are no good.</li></ul>"
stipulate,"<ul><li>To stipulate something means to demand that it be part of an agreement. So when you make a contract or deal, you can stipulate that a certain condition must be met.</li><li>Anytime you draw up a legal agreement, you can stipulate a requirement that has to be met for that agreement to be complete. This stipulation might put some sort of limit on the agreement. For example, if you run a fencing company and offer a sale, you can stipulate that to get the sale price, the fence must be ordered by a certain date. Your customer, in turn, might stipulate that the work must be finished before the ground freezes.</li></ul>"
stockpile,"<ul><li>A stockpile is a large amount of something that you save for later. If you're worried about running out of your favorite flavor of bubble gum, you might decide to keep a stockpile of it.</li><li>If you hear the word stockpile on the news, it's probably referring to weapons which are accumulated and saved by a country that might need to use them some day in the future. You can use stockpile to describe the actual cache of weapons and also as a verb, to describe the act of storing them. The word was originally a mining term that literally described a pile of ore. During World War II, stockpile became a more general term.</li></ul>"
strategy,"<ul><li>In the game of capture-the-flag, running toward your flag screaming is not a good strategy. A strategy is any plan you make to achieve a goal.</li><li>The word strategy was developed to describe plans people made for war, and strategies often rely on certain chief assets––the British strategy for world domination relied on its naval superiority, our strategy for this game relies on the other team's poor level of fitness. After they're exhausted, we go for the goal.</li></ul>"
strictly,
stride,"<ul><li>The noun stride means ""significant progress."" You might make a huge stride towards making peace with the rival school by hosting a block party and inviting their students.</li><li>The noun stride also means ""a step made while running or walking."" If you are bored, you can count your strides between home and the bus stop. As a verb, stride means ""to walk or run by taking long steps."" Elite runners stride, making it look easy. But even if you are a slow jogger, don't give up — you make great strides to improve your health when you exercise regularly.</li></ul>"
strike,"<ul><li>At its most basic, strike means to hit. If you strike someone, you hit them with your hand or a weapon. If lightning strikes, it makes contact. If you strike out on a trip, you're ""hitting"" the road. If you strike gold, you've ""struck it rich""!</li><li>Strike can also mean not to hit, as in miss –– as in ""three strikes and you're out."" That meaning might have evolved from strike meaning to cross off, as in ""If you don't come to practice, coach will strike your name from the starting lineup."" It might also have led to the idea of a labor strike. If employees want to protest their work conditions, they go on strike, or refuse to work until conditions improve.</li></ul>"
striking,"<ul><li>Something striking grabs your attention because it’s vivid and surprising. Many twins have a striking resemblance. People in red satin evening gowns, the pyramids in Egypt, and platform heels with fish in them are also striking.</li><li>Anything striking is hard not to notice; it almost hits, or strikes, you with surprise, like a toddler in a tuxedo. People can be striking, and so can landscapes — one of the most striking sights in the world is the Grand Canyon, which is why so many people visit just to look at it. Non-visual things can be striking too, like a striking thought that makes you shout, “Eureka!”</li></ul>"
string,"<ul><li>A string is a strand of fiber that's thinner than a cord or a rope. You can tie on a Halloween mask with a string, or weave a friendship bracelet with a bunch of colorful strings.</li><li>Strings are useful for tying up packages and cinching the waist of your sweatpants. You can also have a figurative string, a series or sequence: ""Our team had a string of wins."" As a verb, string means ""attach together"" or ""thread onto a string."" It can also mean ""put strings on an instrument"" — you might string your new ukulele, for example. And when you ""string someone along,"" you mislead them on purpose over and over again.</li></ul>"
stringent,"<ul><li>That teacher's demands are stringent — she wants the homework typed in her favorite font, on special paper, and each essay must be exactly 45 lines!</li><li>While the word stringent might seem foreign, if you're afflicted with pimples, you'll know the word astringent. An astringent causes your skin to tighten like it's shrinking your pores. This tightening, constricting feel describes stringent with regard to rules. Stringent safety procedures prevent accidents in a dangerous work environment. And restaurants must adhere to stringent health regulations.</li></ul>"
strip,"<ul><li>The verb strip has many shades of meaning, but most of them involve removing something. Someone may strip you of your power or you may strip off your clothes. Whatever it is that you strip, it’s gone.</li><li>When you strip something, you leave it bare. Strip can refer to removing a covering — like your clothes or like when you strip your sheets from your bed. Robbers may strip your car of all valuable items. And you might need to strip off a coat of paint before you start painting the front door. When used as a noun, strip could be something in a long, narrow shape — like an airstrip or a strip of material.</li></ul>"
stunning,"<ul><li>Someone who is strikingly beautiful can be described as stunning. There's something magical about weddings that makes every bride look stunning.</li><li>The adjective stunning also means causing astonishment, shock, or disbelief. If your basketball team suffers a stunning defeat, it comes at the hands of a rival team you were positive you would beat. Stunning is rooted in the Old French verb estoner, meaning to stun or shock, and it was used in the 1800s as a synonym for excellent. It's still used this way, particularly when something is really impressive, like the school mime troupe's stunning performance.</li></ul>"
sturdy,"<ul><li>Describe something that is firmly constructed or strongly made as sturdy. That house you built was not sturdy at all. It blew down in the last wind storm. Fortunately, it was only a dog house and the dog wasn't in it.</li><li>Physical strength and robust health can also be described as sturdy. Your grandmother is pushing 80, but she is still pretty sturdy if she can beat you at tennis. The adjective sturdy can also describe something (or someone) determined, firm, stalwart, and steady. Hopefully, you and your siblings have a sturdy relationship, so you can withstand all the bickering over who gets to ride shotgun in the car.</li></ul>"
stylus,"<ul><li>A stylus is a tool with a hard, pointed end that you use for writing or drawing. Today, you can also use a stylus to virtually ""write"" on an electronic tablet, computer, or smartphone.</li><li>Styli (or styluses) were originally used in ancient Greece and Rome to scratch writing into wax tablets; the blunt end of the stylus worked as an eraser, smudging the words out. Artists also use styli for shaping clay. If you're lucky enough to have an old-fashioned record player, you know that stylus also refers to the ""needle"" that fits into the grooves of the record and plays it.</li></ul>"
subject,"<ul><li>Subject can mean ""topic,"" as in ""Let's change the subject."" It can also mean ""to make someone do something,"" as in ""Don't let your dad subject you to an hour-long lecture on fishing."" It can also mean everyone in a country who is not the ruler, as in ""The king greeted his subjects when he returned from abroad.""</li><li>A subject could be a broad branch of knowledge, like Biology, or a very narrow focus, like the effects of drought on avocados. If you are painting a portrait, the person posing for you is your subject. Subject can also mean beholden, or subordinate. If you are traveling in England, but not an English subject, or citizen, then you are still subject to English law.</li></ul>"
subjected to,
subsequent,"<ul><li>For something that comes after something else in time or order, choose the adjective subsequent. If the entire class fails an exam, the teacher will hopefully make subsequent ones a little easier.</li><li>Subsequent comes from the Latin subsequi ""to follow closely"" and means just that - following or coming after. If you say, ""in 1990 and subsequent years,"" it includes 1990, whereas ""the years subsequent to 1990"" do not include it. When you mention a car crash and subsequent traffic jam or a scandal and subsequent investigation, one follows the other in order but a cause and effect relationship is implied too.</li></ul>"
subsequently,"<ul><li>Subsequently means ""afterward"": You might be bummed if you bought a book for a friend and subsequently discovered that she'd already read it.</li><li>Subsequently derives from a Latin verb meaning ""to follow."" We use subsequently to describe something in time that follows something else. You ran off to Mexico with your boyfriend but subsequently discovered he was interested only in your sports car. Thousands of people showed up for the rock concert and the town subsequently changed its laws to prevent such large gatherings.</li></ul>"
subsidiary,"<ul><li>If a company belongs to another company, then the owned company is a subsidiary.  When a large company bought your small business, you became a subsidiary.  It still hurts to call them the parent company, since you publish novels and they make toilet paper.</li><li>The adjective form of subsidiary describes something that is of secondary importance or that functions in a supporting capacity. In addition to running the band program, you're a member of several subsidiary committees like the fund raising committee and the hospitality committee. Traffic on the road was light when you drove outside the city, but as more subsidiary roads joined with the main one, traffic quickly became congested.</li></ul>"
substantial,"<ul><li>Something substantial is large in size, number, or amount: If you want to say someone spent a lot of money without being too specific, you could say they spent a substantial amount of money.</li><li>The adjective substantial derives from the Latin substantia ""substance,"" which means ""stuff."" A substantial meal is large enough to satisfy hunger. A substantial structure is strongly made or built. And a substantial man possesses wealth and property. Related to this last sense, ""a man of substance"" refers to a wealthy man with property.</li></ul>"
substantially,"<ul><li>Substantially means ""to a great extent."" Your college fund was substantially increased by your grandfather's generous gift.  What the heck, I'll throw in a quarter, too.</li><li>Substantially is a good word to know any time you want to establish something's extent. It basically suggests ""a large part."" Your raise made your life substantially easier.  The word also suggests an essential nature, as in ""Nothing was substantially changed by the new law."" The word carries a great deal of weight, as can be seen in this quote by Albert Einstein: ""We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive.""</li></ul>"
substantiate,"<ul><li>To substantiate is to give support to a claim. We’d really like to believe in the Tooth Fairy; however, more evidence is needed to substantiate her existence (besides that quarter in your pocket).</li><li>Substantiate is related to the word substantial, which means ""solid."" So, to substantiate a claim is to make it solid or believable. If the evidence given in support of an argument is weak and unconvincing, that evidence can be described as insubstantial. Of course, in special cases like the Tooth Fairy, having substantial evidence doesn’t seem to matter; fans just keep on believing.</li></ul>"
substitute,"<ul><li>Something or someone that takes the place of another is said to be a substitute. You may be sent into a game as a substitute for an injured player, or you might substitute chocolate chips for blueberries in a pancake recipe.</li><li>Substitute can be used as an adjective to describe something or someone that takes the place of another. Teenagers are notoriously hard on substitute teachers, sometimes giving them fake names or wrong information about classroom work. Substitute can also be used as a verb. So if you are asked to substitute for a teacher, you probably shouldn't believe everything the students tell you!</li></ul>"

So if you are asked to substitute for a teacher, you probably shouldn't believe everything the students tell you!</li></ul>"
subtle,"<ul><li>Something that is subtle is not obvious: a professional food taster might be able to perceive subtle differences of flavor that most people don't notice.</li><li>Subtle is used for things that are hard to describe because of their complexity or delicacy: a way of thinking, arguing, or creating a work of art.  The word is pronounced like ""suttle"" and it was originally spelled that way when it was borrowed from Old French, but the b got imported to make the word look more like its ultimate source, the Latin adjective subtilis. If you try to pronounce the b, your ignorance of how to say the word properly won't be very subtle!</li></ul>"
succession,"<ul><li>Use the word succession to describe things that follow one another, as well as the order in which they do so. The Vice President is first in line of succession to be the President and the Secretary of State is fourth.</li><li>Sometimes when a leader dies, the one who rules after him is determined not by law as in the U.S. or blood as in a monarchy but by the dying leader himself. Dictators often groom one of their sons for succession. Figuratively, you can use succession to indicate that one thing after another has come and gone without taking hold. The storefront has been home to a succession of businesses, all of which have failed. Fashions come and go in quick succession.</li></ul>"
successive,"<ul><li>Successive is a word for things (or people) that follow each other in time. If three presidents in a row were over sixty, you could say, ""Three successive presidents were over sixty.""</li><li>Successive is a word that comes up often when you're looking at the history of something. Back in the 1960s, eight successive Boston Celtics teams won the NBA championship. In school, if you do very well, you could get an A in three successive math classes. Even though successive has the word success in it, it's not necessarily a good thing: you could also miss ten successive free throws.</li></ul>"
successively,
sue,"<ul><li>If you sue someone, you're accusing them (in court) of doing something wrong or illegal and demanding that they pay for it. Almost every time someone sues, they're looking for money.</li><li>One of the last things you want to hear is ""I'll sue you!"" People sue for a lot of reasons. If you slipped on the ice, you could sue the sidewalk owner for not putting salt down. If you were in a car accident, you could sue the other driver. Years ago, someone sued McDonald's for scalding themselves on a cup of coffee they said was too hot. Sometimes it seems like people will find any reason to sue.</li></ul>"
suitable,"<ul><li>As suitable means appropriate for the purpose, you can imagine that sneakers are more suitable than high heels at a track meet.</li><li>While suitable always means appropriate for a certain person or situation, sometimes it is not based on fact but merely a matter of opinion. A bicycle is not a suitable mode of transportation during a winter storm because the rider is exposed to the elements. However, the clothing that you think is just fine for school might seem unsuitable to the principal. Unfortunately, he has the final say in that one!</li></ul>"
suited,
sumptuous,"<ul><li>Sumptuous could be used to describe a room appointed with the finest furniture, a lush orchestra playing a beautiful symphony, or a meal meant for a king. Sumptuous describes something that costs a lot and imparts sensory pleasure.</li><li>Sumptuous comes from the Latin sumptus, which means ""expensive."" Sumptus is related to sumere, which means ""to consume."" The word sumptuous carries both meanings with it. It is a pricey, luxurious thing that's meant to be consumed or enjoyed. You wouldn't use sumptuous to describe a tractor, even if it has leather seats.</li></ul>"
sunk,
supersede,"<ul><li>When something supersedes, it takes the place of something else. The 5th edition of your history textbook supersedes the 4th edition.</li><li>Most words that include super have something good going on. Supersede is from the 16th-century Latin for ""sit on top,"" and it often means to replace with something better. A version 10 of a computer game will supersede, version 9, making it more exciting. Unfortunately, a person might be replaced too, as in ""the younger running back will supersede the veteran player as he gets older."" To supersede is generally a good thing, but being superseded is not always that great for the replaced person.</li></ul>"
supplant,"<ul><li>Kate was out sick for a month with mono, and when she came back to school, Jessie had supplanted her as the funny girl at the lunch table. Supplant means to take the place of.</li><li>Being supplanted is something that often happens to ideas or ways of thinking. Encouraging children's freedom has supplanted old ideas about children being better seen than heard. After a shocking upset at Wimbledon, a new tennis player has supplanted the reigning champion.</li></ul>"
supplement,"<ul><li>A supplement is something added to something else. Nutritional supplements add vitamins and minerals to the ones already included in the food you eat.</li><li>If a zombie army wants to increase its ranks but is running out of bodies, it might supplement its troops with mummies. If the zombies put out their manifesto and then realize they left out an important point, they might supplement the manifesto with a press release. That press release could also be referred to as a supplement.</li></ul>"
supplemental,"<ul><li>You can use the adjective supplemental to describe something extra. You could volunteer to donate your collection of markers and colored pencils to a local school that needs supplemental art supplies.</li><li>Something that's supplemental is added when there's a lack or deficiency. You might feed the runt from a litter of puppies supplemental milk because he can't get enough from his mother. Teachers are famous for assigning supplemental reading to round out the information in a textbook. Supplemental comes from the Latin supplementum, ""added to supply a deficiency.""</li></ul>"
suppress,"<ul><li>To suppress something means to curb, inhibit, or even stop it. If the sound of your boss moving in his chair sounds like gas, you’re going to have to learn how to suppress your giggles.</li><li>In the strictest sense, suppress means to put an end to something by force, like a government that suppresses the right to free speech by shutting down the newspapers or the military suppressing an uprising by rebel forces. But we also use suppress in less serious terms to describe an attempt to muffle or stifle something, such as suppressing a sneeze in a quiet theater or suppressing your true emotions to not cause a teary scene.</li></ul>"
surmise,"<ul><li>If you see empty ice cream containers on the table, sprinkles littering the ground, and a can of whipped cream in the trash, you can surmise what happened: someone made sundaes. To surmise is to form an opinion or make a guess about something.</li><li>If you surmise that something is true, you don't have much evidence or knowledge about it. Near synonyms are guess, conjecture, and suppose. You might say, ""I can't even surmise what he would do in such a situation."" Surmise came to English from the French surmettre, ""to accuse,"" which is formed from the prefix sur-, ""on, upon,"" plus mettre, ""to put"" (from Latin mittere, ""to send"").</li></ul>"
surplus,"<ul><li>A surplus is something extra or left over. If your tree produces more apples than you can eat, you can make applesauce with the surplus of apples.</li><li>The army surplus store sells old or out-of-date clothing and equipment that the military doesn't need. If you earn more money than you spend, then you have a surplus of cash. The word surplus has  familiar parts: sur- is a shortened form of super, meaning ""extra"" or ""additional,"" and plus just means ""more.""</li></ul>"
surveillance,"<ul><li>Many times, a person suspected of something illegal by the authorities is placed under surveillance, meaning he or she is closely watched to see if their suspicions are well-founded.</li><li>If you break down the word surveillance you get the prefix sur, from the French word for ""over"" and the root veiller, meaning ""to watch."" All of which is a roundabout way of saying that if you are under surveillance, you are being closely watched — usually by the authorities, and usually not for a good reason! Those surveillance cameras in banks and stores are put there in the hopes of both preventing crimes and recognizing criminals after a crime has been committed.</li></ul>"
susceptible,"<ul><li>If you are susceptible to something such as infections or earaches, it means you are likely to become sick with these things.</li><li>Have you ever received something you don't want? Well, with susceptible meaning ""likely to be influenced or affected by"" that is probably going to be the case. If you're susceptible to flattery, and someone wants something from you, all they have to do is give you a compliment or two and you'll do what they want. Material that's susceptible to cracking won't be in good condition for long.</li></ul>"
suspect,"<ul><li>A suspect is a person who is believed to be guilty of a crime. If you leave the scene of a murder with blood on your hands and a weapon in your pocket, you’re likely to become a prime suspect.</li><li>If others believe you have committed a crime, you are a suspect. The word can also be used as a verb and an adjective. To suspect someone of something is to believe that they probably did it. Do you ever suspect your parents of taking some of your Halloween candy? If something such as someone's excuse or motive is suspect, it seems a bit off. That bad-smelling piece of fish is suspect — you'd better not eat it.</li></ul>"
suspend,"<ul><li>You can use the verb suspend any time you need to stop something. Whether it’s your judgment, a rule, or bus service, when you suspend it, you temporarily bring it to a halt.</li><li>Suspend often describes stopping an activity for a while. A winter storm, for example, may suspend air travel until weather conditions improve. Suspend also works in a more figurative sense, such as when you suspend your doubt in order to give someone or something a fair chance. A student who is suspended is temporarily forbidden from attending class. Don't confuse this with expel, which means he or she may never return.</li></ul>"
sustain,"<ul><li>Sustain means to support something or keep it going. If you get hungry in the mid-afternoon, you might try snacking to sustain your energy through dinner.</li><li>Beams and rafters sustain a roof — they keep it up. If you sustain a conversation over the course of hours, you keep it going during that time. If you sustain an injury, it means you are injured. If you sustain an interest in what you're studying, it means that you're just as excited about the subject after studying as you are when you began.</li></ul>"
sustainable,"<ul><li>If something is sustainable, then it can be maintained or continued. A 5-minute mile pace probably isn't sustainable for anyone other than Olympic marathon runners.</li><li>These days this adjective is often used to describe something that has a low long-term effect on the environment, like ""sustainable agriculture"" — a method of farming that doesn’t ravage the land, deplete resources permanently, or produce a great deal of pollution. Break down the word into two parts: sustain and able, to visualize and remember that you're able to sustain something sustainable.</li></ul>"
sustenance,"<ul><li>Sustenance comes from the word sustain, which means to continue. Sustenance is food or drink that allows you to continue to be alive. For many, prayer is a source of spiritual sustenance.</li><li>If your chief source of sustenance is candy, you are going to get sick, but you will have a good time while it lasts. In much of the world, rice and beans provide sustenance to human beings. In the US, Native Americans taught Europeans how to grow corn, which turned into a major source of sustenance for their population.</li></ul>"
swell,"<ul><li>To swell is to expand or grow larger. If your brother's face started to swell after he ate lobster for the first time, you'd probably guess that he's allergic to shellfish.</li><li>You can use the word swell to describe what happens to an injured body part, like a black eye that swells up, or in a figurative way, to describe a feeling of fullness, like when your heart swells with pride at your sister's big music performance. In the 1930s, swell became a popular slang term meaning great or excellent. But it also can describe a wealthy, elegant person, like a group of swells at a fancy restaurant.</li></ul>"

swiftly,
symmetric,
synthesis,"<ul><li>Synthesis is the act of combining elements to form something new. If you describe your bedroom decor as a synthesis of vintage and punk, we'll know you mean a mixture of these two styles.</li><li>Synthesis can be either concrete or abstract. Scientists use the word to talk about what happens when chemicals combine — think of photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize light, carbon dioxide, and water to produce food. If you write a screenplay titled Batman Saves Jane Eyre, then that's synthesis as well (though you may have trouble selling it). Synthesis can also refer to the act of combining ideas.</li></ul>"
tactic,"<ul><li>Tactic is another word for a maneuver or method. If begging doesn't convince your parents to raise your allowance, you might want to try a different tactic—like doing all your chores without being asked.</li><li>English-speakers have been talking about tactics since at least 1640, when this word was first recorded. A tactic is just a way to do something, a plan, or an approach. Generals have to have a good grasp on military tactics to win a battle; football teams have to use strong defensive tactics to keep the other guys from scoring. One time-tested tactic for winning over a teacher? Always turn your homework in on time!</li></ul>"
tactual,
tailspin,"<ul><li>When a plane goes into a tailspin, it rotates as it dives toward the ground. While pilots sometimes go into a deliberate tailspin, an unexpected tailspin would be terrifying.</li><li>Because of the dramatic nature of an aircraft's tailspin, the word is also used figuratively to mean ""a chaotic or panicked situation or state."" Getting terrible news sends some people into a tailspin, while others are able to somehow stay calm. The word dates from about 1915, and the figurative meaning first appeared in print in the 1930s.</li></ul>"
take place,
take,"<ul><li>Take means to gain possession of or lay hold of something. You can take an apple from a bowl or take a child's hand to cross the street.</li><li>Ways to take include receiving, removing, capturing, picking something up, or being seized by something. Take has many, many senses and has found its way into many English expressions. So take a picture, take some notes, take notice, take a walk, take your friend home safely, take a chance, take a left, take a knight, take it as it comes, take first place, or receive a large take (as in profit), but remember, “You can’t take it with you.”</li></ul>"
tame,"<ul><li>If something is tame, it cannot surprise or injure you. It’s predictable. Tame can be used as an adjective or verb. A circus lion is tame (adjective) because it’s been tamed (verb). A “lion-tamer” beat the wildness out of it.</li><li>Sometimes tame isn’t fun — and not just for the bears who ride bicycles under the Big Top. Tame isn’t appealing when you’re going on a rollercoaster or seeing a fireworks display. If a friend tells you a concert is tame, will you rush out for tickets? Tame, however, is not all bad. Some people take anger management courses to learn to “tame their tempers.” Others work to “tame their tongues” after hurting another person with a careless comment.</li></ul>"
tangible,"<ul><li>When you can touch something, it's tangible: ""I need tangible proof that aliens exist — I want to shake their little green hands!""</li><li>Tangible is from Latin tangere, ""to touch,"" and it simply means something that can be touched or felt, though it can be used in metaphorical senses: tangible assets have a value that can be precisely measured, and tangible grief can be clearly sensed by an onlooker. So you might not need to physically touch something for it to be tangible, but it has to be grounded in the real world of facts: ""Has the teen pop star demonstrated any tangible ability to sing?""</li></ul>"
tantalizing,"<ul><li>Something tantalizing is tempting: like a meal that smells amazing and makes you want to eat it. Tantalizing things are very appealing.</li><li>When something is tantalizing, it makes you want it, even if it's totally out of reach. An exciting movie trailer could be tantalizing if it makes you want to see the movie. A little part of a song can be tantalizing if it tempts you to hear more. Smells — when they're good smells — can be very tantalizing. Just walking through a good restaurant, smelling and looking at the food, is a tantalizing experience.</li></ul>"
taper,"<ul><li>To taper is to gradually grow smaller or more narrow or less intense. Taper is often used with the word ""off."" Part of the power of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is how the two walls appear to taper off into infinity.</li><li>As a verb, taper can refer not just to physical objects that narrow: the weather forecast might call for heavy snow that will taper off at the end of the day, and public interest in a political scandal might taper off over time.  As a noun, taper refers to a shape that narrows at one end, and it's also another word for a candle that is smaller at one end than the other. ""Narrow candle"" is the original meaning of the word, and it seems to derive from the Latin papyrus, which was once used to make candle wicks.</li></ul>"
task,"<ul><li>A task can be big or small, easy or really hard — but it's never more than a job that needs to get done.</li><li>Chop chop! There's a task that needs completing, and you're just the person for the job. If you're smart though, you'll figure out a way to task someone else with it, or assign it elsewhere. Task comes to us all the way from the Latin word taxare, which in its earliest days meant ""to impose a tax on."" So much like the filling out of your tax forms, most tasks are considered chores.</li></ul>"
technique,"<ul><li>A technique is a method of doing some task or performing something. Your technique for opening drinks might be to twist the top off with your teeth. If so, your dentist better have a good tooth-repair technique.</li><li>The noun technique can also refer to someone's skillfulness with the fundamentals of a particular task. A violinist could have excellent technique, but lack passion, for example. Writers usually have very individual writing techniques: One might need to write late at night and another early in the morning; some have to write by hand on paper, while others always use the computer.</li></ul>"
teem with,
tempting,"<ul><li>Anything that's tempting makes you excited or interested, like a tempting chocolate doughnut or a tempting offer to go to the movies instead of doing your chores.</li><li>An invitation or offer that intrigues you is tempting—even if it might ultimately be a bad idea. It's tempting to skip school and spend the afternoon at the beach, but it's wiser to avoid the temptation. People commonly describe food they feel is bad for them as tempting. This sense of something that's both harmful and attractive comes from the original meaning of tempt, ""entice to evil or sin.""</li></ul>"
tenacity,"<ul><li>Most people will tell you that tenacity is a great quality to have, especially if you're trying something challenging that takes a while to complete.</li><li>Odds are, the people you admire have shown real tenacity in achieving their goals. Anything really worth doing takes persistence, perseverance, and stubborn determination. Being a great baseball player requires real gifts, no doubt, but even the most gifted player won't make it to the big leagues without the tenacity required to make the long, hard journey up from the minors. Tenacity is the quality displayed by someone who just won't quit — who keeps trying until they reach their goal.</li></ul>"
tend,"<ul><li>If you manage, run, or work at a store, you can say you tend it. If you tend the bar in a restaurant, for example, you serve drinks, dry glasses, and fill dishes with pretzels.</li><li>You can also say you tend something if you care for it. You have to tend a vegetable garden, for example, if you expect to harvest more vegetables than weeds. If you are inclined to do something, then you tend to do that thing. You might tend to let your homework go until the last minute and then stay up all night to get it done — probably not the most efficient way to go about it.</li></ul>"
tendency,"<ul><li>A tendency is an inclination to do something. For example, dogs have a tendency to bark at strangers and the mail man.</li><li>We all have tendencies: things we're inclined to do, or like to do, or just can't help doing. Morning people have a tendency to get up early. Basketball players usually have a tendency to go right or left. Optimists have a tendency to look on the bright side of things; pessimists have the opposite tendency. Other things have tendencies too, like how the stock market tends to go up and down.</li></ul>"
tenet,"<ul><li>A tenet is a principle or belief honored by a person or, more often, a group of people. ""Seek pleasure and avoid pain"" is a basic tenet of Hedonism. ""God exists"" is a tenet of most major religions.</li><li>Tenet is pronounced ""ten’it."" The word evolved from the Latin tenere ""to hold."" The noun tenet is an opinion or doctrine one holds. It usually refers to a philosophy or a religion, but it doesn't have to — for instance, Eastern medicine has different tenets from Western medicine. One of the central tenets of succeeding in the workplace is that a good offense is the best defense.</li></ul>"
tension,"<ul><li>When things feel so tight they might snap, that's tension.  If you buy your girlfriend a vacuum cleaner when she wanted diamonds, you will experience tension. Just before she storms out of the room.</li><li>The noun tension has its Latin roots in tendere, which means to stretch, and tension occurs when something is stretched either physically or emotionally. Strained relations between countries can cause political tensions to rise. You can add tension to a rubber band by stretching it tight. You can release nervous tension by releasing that tension in the rubber band, when you shoot it at your brother.</li></ul>"
tenuous,"<ul><li>If something is tenuous it's thin, either literally or metaphorically. If you try to learn a complicated mathematical concept by cramming for 45 minutes, you will have a tenuous grasp of that concept, at best.</li><li>Tenuous comes from the Latin word tenuis, for thin, and is related to our word tender. Something can be physically tenuous, like a spiderweb or ice on a pond. We more often use it in a metaphorical sense, to talk about weak ideas. Tenuous arguments won't win any debate tournaments. Synonyms for tenuous, also used physically or metaphorically, are flimsy and shaky.</li></ul>"
terminal,"<ul><li>Terminal is a word with many meanings. Depending on how it's used, it can describe a place where passengers end their journey, a computer screen and keyboard, or a life-ending disease.</li><li>As a noun, terminal describes a bus or train station at the end of the line. When your aunt takes the bus into town, you pick her up at the terminal. Her visit becomes very sad when your aunt tells you she's been diagnosed with an illness that's terminal — an adjective meaning she hasn't long to live. This is surprising news, since you've always believed your aunt is a hypochondriac. Now you have to go to your computer terminal and look up her disease.</li></ul>"
terminate,"<ul><li>To terminate something is to bring it to an end. Period. Full stop.</li><li>In ancient Rome, Terminus was the God of landmarks, boundaries, and endings. That’s why his annual party took place at the end of the year.  You can imagine the guests walking around in their togas, going, “This party is so great, I wish it would never terminate.” Nowadays, terminate can be used to refer to bringing anything to an end — including one's job or a product line: ""When the Weird Food Company announces plans to terminate production of its deep-fried chocolate-covered pickle line, it will be a sad day for lovers of strange snacks.""</li></ul>"
terrain,"<ul><li>An ATV, or all-terrain vehicle, is useful for people who drive on lots of different terrain, hence the name. Terrain is a noun used to talk about the ground, when you're specifically interested in how it appears or is shaped.</li><li>In times of war, you'll often hear the term ""hostile terrain"" used to describe a region with lots of mountains, vast stretches of desert, or impenetrable jungles. These are all areas of difficult terrain that are hard to pass. Much of humankind's history can be traced by its effort to alter the terrain. We've made mountains into meadows, rivers into lakes, and prairies into roads, all to make the terrain more livable for us. You could even go so far as to say that a person's psyche is mysterious terrain.</li></ul>"
testify,"<ul><li>To testify is to make a statement or provide evidence, usually in court. Witnesses testify for the prosecution or defense.</li><li>If you've ever seen a TV show about lawyers, you've probably seen someone testifying: putting their hand on the Bible, sitting in the witness seat, and telling what they know about a case. Testifying is serious business, but it doesn't always happen in court: If someone knows you're good at math, they can testify to your math skills. Or if you've been to a restaurant, you can testify to your friends that it has awesome desserts.</li></ul>"
therefore,"<ul><li>The adverb therefore means as a result or consequence, or ""for that reason."" Cats and dogs tend to fight; therefore, keep your pets apart at night if you want to get some sleep.</li><li>The adverb therefore is also used to introduce a conclusion that follows based on logic. You'll see this construction a lot in logic, math, and science, for example. Of course, sometimes the conclusions are false, as in this argument: ""All fish live in water. A whale lives in water. Therefore, a whale is a fish."" A whale is, in fact, a mammal. Therefore, the argument that a whale is a fish is wrong.</li></ul>"
thorough,"<ul><li>Thorough describes something that is painstakingly complete, like a thorough search for your missing keys in which you look for them in coat pockets, under the table, in the refrigerator — in every single place you can think of.</li><li>Thorough rhymes with ""burrow"": ""THUR-oh."" It looks a lot like through but remember thorough is an adjective, so you might use it to describe a thorough investigation or a thorough review. In contrast through is used most often as a preposition — you might look through every drawer, for example, in a search — or as an adverb — you might see a hole in your pocket where coins fall through.</li></ul>"
thoroughly,"<ul><li>Thoroughly means exhaustively and completely. No matter how thoroughly you clean every carpet, shelf, and windowpane in a house, there is always more dust to be found.</li><li>Thorough comes from the word through, and originally meant passing completely through something. We use thorough and thoroughly now to show that we have really been as meticulous as possible in a given task. If a detective interviews everyone present at the scene of the crime, collects all the biological evidence, and takes pictures from every angle, then we can say she investigated the crime thoroughly.</li></ul>"
threaten,"<ul><li>Something that threatens makes its danger known. Storm clouds threaten rain, and bullies threaten other kids.</li><li>Unfortunately, there are lots of people and things that threaten — it's a dangerous world. If someone threatens you with violence, you should call the police. The police may then threaten the criminal with arresting them. Nations threaten each other before going to war. You can also say a dangerous situation is threatening, like gloomy weather. Sometimes this word is used more lightheartedly, like if an old friend threatens to hug you to death.</li></ul>"
threshold,"<ul><li>A threshold is what you step across when you enter a room. A threshold takes you from one place into another, and when you're about to start something new, you're also on a threshold.</li><li>A threshold is a point of departure or transition. Graduation can mark a threshold — when you graduate from circus school, you're standing at the threshold of your new career as a trapeze artist. Another kind of threshold is a limit or boundary. If you have a high threshold for pain, you can tolerate a lot of it, and your dentist can drill away without worrying about your squirming and howling.</li></ul>"
thrill,"<ul><li>Thrill doesn’t refer to any old type of excitement; this stuff is intense. For many people, the experience of riding a roller coaster provides a great thrill, or an intense feeling of excitement.</li><li>Thrill comes from an Old English word meaning “pierce,” suggesting the metaphor of being “pierced by emotion.” Thrill is often used in a strictly positive sense, though it can also refer to the unique combination of terror and pleasure that some people experience in certain situations — for example, when riding death-defying roller coasters or watching frightening flicks (often called thrillers).</li></ul>"
through,"<ul><li>As an adjective, through means finished or done. As an adverb it can mean backward and forward, completely, up to and including, or all the way to the end. The preposition through means in and out of.</li><li>Through has lots of meanings. If you finished your homework you might shout — gleefully — ""I'm through!"" Those people who wouldn't be quiet talked through the entire movie. The first half of the alphabet are the letters A through M. If you've memorized the multiplication table, you know the whole thing through. And, of course, you walk through a door.</li></ul>"
throughout,"<ul><li>Use the adverb throughout for things that keep going from beginning to end. If you mention your perfect grades several times throughout a conversation, your interviewer will know you're smart, but might also think you're kind of obnoxious.</li><li>Throughout means ""from start to finish,"" although it doesn't have to mean constantly from start to finish. Your brother might complain that you had to stop and pee throughout the entire road trip, but he doesn't mean you were literally doing it the whole time, just like every two hours. In academic writing, throughout, or sometimes passim (""throughout"" in Latin) is a way of saying that an idea shows up all over a book, not just on a certain page.</li></ul>"
thus,"<ul><li>Use the adverb thus in place of words like therefore or so when you want to sound proper.</li><li>Use thus interchangeably with words like consequently, ergo, hence, and just like that. For example, if you want to sound fancy you could say no one showed up for water aerobics, thus the class was cancelled. It had to be thus. Thus is also, rarely, a noun that means a good-smelling gum resin from trees that we don't really use anymore.</li></ul>"
tie,"<ul><li>A tie is a thin piece of cloth that's knotted around the neck, an accessory worn by men on formal occasions. You may wear a tie to graduation, a wedding, or if you're just trying to impress someone.</li><li>If the score of a game is equal, then the game is a tie. Some games, like chess, can actually end in a tie, but other games, like basketball, continue until there's a winner. You can also use the word tie as a verb: ""Looks like the game will tie at two apiece."" As a verb, tie also means to fasten two or more things together, like when you tie your shoelaces or your tie.</li></ul>"
timid,"<ul><li>Timid means ""overly cautious or fearful,"" like a timid driver who drives very slowly or avoids highways altogether.</li><li>Timid comes from the Middle French word timide, meaning ""easily frightened, shy."" Those who are timid often worry that things will go wrong: a timid eater orders bland food to avoid the possibility not liking the flavor of something new, just as a timid partygoer talks to people he already knows, afraid that he won't be able to talk to strangers.</li></ul>"
to be sure,
to some extent,
toil,"<ul><li>Toil is another word for work. You toil as a customer service rep all day, but you'd prefer to work as a rock goddess. Unfortunately, there weren't many ads in the employment section for goddesses — rock or otherwise.</li><li>Although toil means ""work"" (in both its noun and verb forms), it usually has the added meaning of hard work, especially physical labor.  If you'd lived during the Great Depression, you might have toiled on roadwork and conservation projects. Your toils would have created roads in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, for example.  Thanks for all your hard work!  Now, relax and enjoy the scenery.</li></ul>"
tolerate,"<ul><li>The verb tolerate means ""to put up with or allow."" You can tolerate your sister's love of Broadway musicals but really, you prefer dramas.</li><li>Think of tolerate as the open-minded verb. It means you allow something to happen or exist, even if you don't really like it. For example, you don't like your neighbor's loud music but you tolerate because he only blasts it on Saturday afternoons. Scientifically speaking, when your body can tolerate a drug, poison or even pollution, it means you aren't harmed by it.</li></ul>"
toxic,"<ul><li>Danger! Hazardous! Do not eat! These are just some of the warnings you'll see on toxic substances — meaning stuff that's poisonous and even deadly.</li><li>Cobra bites, wild mystery mushrooms and strong chemicals are all toxic. So are certain people, if they have particularly mean personalities. Toxic is related to the word toxin, which is a kind of poison. It comes from the ancient Greek word toxikon, which means ""poison for arrows."" Some toxic arrows could come in handy for those toxic personalities...</li></ul>"
track,"<ul><li>If you document your study time and record all your exam scores, then you track your progress in school. In this case the verb track shows that you're following the path of something. The noun track can refer to a path of a more literal kind.</li><li>The noun track can describe a variety of paths, such as the rails that trains chug along, a course that racehorses run, or the big oval course in an ice rink.
If you're competing in a five-lap race and you have the fastest speed after the first four laps, you're on track to win the race. In this case the term ""on track"" is describing a figurative path, one that indicates you're in a good position to achieve what you want.</li></ul>"
tract,"<ul><li>A tract is a large, open piece of land — like that tract of farmland you bought when you decided your dream in life was to raise llamas. Tract is also a word for a short pamphlet or booklet, like that tract you recently read entitled ""The Care and Feeding of Llamas.""</li><li>In addition to referring to areas of land and small booklets, the word tract can describe complicated systems or structures in the body. If you were to unwind your intestine, an important part of your digestive tract, it would not stretch across a large tract of land, but only 25-28 feet — but that's still pretty long! (You probably don't need to read a tract on human anatomy to realize this would be an unhealthy experiment.)</li></ul>"
transfer,"<ul><li>If you are moving something from one place to another, like transferring money from your savings account to your checking account, you are transferring it. Or, if you've been moved from one job site to another — you, my friend, have been transferred.</li><li>Transfer can also be a noun that means the act of moving something from one form or location to another, so that money that was shifted from one account to another is considered a transfer. If you change something from one form to another, you can say that you transferred it. ""Her mother had transferred all the old 8mm home movies to video tape. Now she'd have to transfer them again using a more modern technology.""</li></ul>"
transformation,"<ul><li>A transformation is a dramatic change in form or appearance. An important event like getting your driver’s license, going to college, or getting married can cause a transformation in your life.</li><li>A transformation is an extreme, radical change. A simple haircut won't cause a transformation in your appearance, but if you dyed your hair purple and got a tattoo across your forehead, that would be another story. When a transformation occurs, we often use the phrase ""undergo a transformation"" in reference to the person or thing who has changed. So, if you do opt for the new hair color and tattoo, you will certainly have ""undergone a transformation.""</li></ul>"
transitory,"<ul><li>If something is fleeting or lasts a short time, it is transitory. Your boss declared the company's restructuring to be transitory, and promised that the company would emerge stronger and better than ever.</li><li>The adjective transitory describes something that is fleeting, temporary, or brief. Even a transitory storm that passes quickly can get you drenched. Consider it an honor to be on the transitory team that helps the president make a smooth transfer of power. When you met your first love, your parents thought that the relationship was transitory — but fifty years later, you're still married!</li></ul>"
trappings,"<ul><li>Big house, shiny new car, a custom-made suit, an expensive watch, cool sunglasses... If you have these things, you have the trappings of success, which means you own things that give you the outward appearance of success.</li><li>The word trappings originally described the decorations people attached to their horse's bridle and saddle. The goal was to make a statement about the rider's power and privilege. Today, we still have trappings, but they take other forms, such as expensive clothing with big logos or big diamond earrings. Trappings are material items that tell the world that someone has money — or a credit card — but not about who he or she is on the inside.</li></ul>"
trauma,"<ul><li>A trauma is a shock to the body or spirit. A car accident can cause physical trauma like broken bones while losing your dog on a walk is an emotional trauma.</li><li>When you think of trauma think of blunt force. Trauma tends to come on all at once and be quite serious. Someone who experiences trauma will have either a traumatic injury or traumatic distress. Try not to use this term lightly. If you say that having to wait twenty minutes for a burger was a trauma, people will rightly accuse you of drama.</li></ul>"
traumatic,"<ul><li>Something is traumatic if it's very upsetting, painful, or disturbing. The word is related to a Greek word meaning ""wound,"" so you can think of traumatic as something involving a wound, either physical or mental.</li><li>Your brother's reckless driving could make getting to school a traumatic experience in terms of your mental health. Traumatic can also describe a major physical injury, such as a traumatic brain injury. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a medical term used to describe the lasting and debilitating effects of something awful you've experienced, such as witnessing a disaster or suffering a major injury during combat.</li></ul>"
traverse,"<ul><li>The verb traverse means to travel across an extended area. ""Her dream was to traverse the country by car, so she could meet new people and see all the kitschy sites — like the giant roadside tire in Michigan or the shoe house in Pennsylvania.""</li><li>The verb traverse can also mean ""to span,"" to span a physical space or time. ""The bridge traversed the river, linking the two cities."" Traverse can be used for any crossing, but it often is used when implying the crossing will be difficult. ""She was exhausted from traveling in the snowy conditions, but she still had to traverse an icy bridge before she would arrive safely home.""</li></ul>"
tremendous,"<ul><li>Tremendous means extraordinarily large in size, extent, amount, power, or degree. It can also mean really marvelous and fantastic — or really awful and terrible.</li><li>We often use tremendous if something is super wonderful. If someone comes into your office and tells you you just won a big contract and are getting a huge bonus, you might exclaim, “Tremendous!” Tremendous comes from the Latin for ""trembling,"" and is connected with fear. Something tremendous can be big in a terrifying way, like the tremendous noise of an approaching hurricane, or a tremendous tidal wave about to crash on the shore.</li></ul>"
trend,"<ul><li>A trend is what's hip or popular at a certain point in time. While a trend usually refers to a certain style in fashion or entertainment, there could be a trend toward warmer temperatures (if people are following trends associated with global warming).</li><li>A trend simply reflects what seems to be going around at any given time. A trend can be in any area and doesn't only reflect fashion, pop culture and entertainment. There can also be a trend in the stock market to be bullish or bearish, depending on economic indicators, or  a political trend reflecting a nation’s current mood. Some trends are fun, some fabulous, some appalling, but however long they last, you can be sure there will always be a new trend coming along to replace the old.</li></ul>"
tricky,"<ul><li>If something is tricky, it's difficult, like a tricky puzzle. And if a person is tricky, they're sneaky, skilled, or crafty, like a tricky magician who makes it look easy to pull quarters out of your ears.</li><li>A tricky riddle is extremely hard to figure out, and a tricky question on a math test is even trickier if you can't use a calculator to solve it. In their 1986 rap classic, ""It's Tricky,"" Run-DMC claimed that ""it's tricky...to rock a rhyme that's right on time"" — or in other words, it's really difficult to write a clever rap lyric.</li></ul>"
trigger,"<ul><li>A trigger is a metal lever that when pulled discharges a gun. You shoot the gun by pulling the trigger. Trigger can also mean the start of a process––violent protests might trigger a revolution.</li><li>Certain scents, places, or old love songs can be said to trigger, or activate, memories. If you get weepy when you hear the national anthem, that may be because it triggers thoughts of family, home, baseball and the Fourth of July. For someone in frail health, a seemingly minor problem like getting a common cold, might trigger a series of physical responses that end up landing them in the hospital.</li></ul>"
truism,"<ul><li>Here's a truism for you: Only people who look up words they don't know can expand their vocabularies. Did you find that statement obvious, boring, and saying nothing new or interesting? That's the perfect description of a truism.</li><li>Sometimes truisms can be mistaken for factual statements. In fact, despite their seeming obviousness, they are usually opinions. Many people who look up words in the dictionary don't improve their vocabularies, as much as they'd like to. Another truism: You get what you pay for. Well, a lot of the time, sure, but not always. That's why the word bargain was invented.</li></ul>"
turbulent,"<ul><li>Turbulent means chaotic, disordered, characterized by conflict. A time of war is a turbulent time for a country. If your family moves and your parents get divorced, you might call that a turbulent period in your history.</li><li>This adjective also commonly describes unstable or violent movement in the atmosphere, or in oceans and rivers. When the pilot comes announces turbulent air or turbulence ahead, get ready for the plane to bump and shake. Turbulence has another specialized sense when describing an uneven flow of a liquid or gas.</li></ul>"
turn,"<ul><li>When you turn something, you rotate it or move it around an axis, the way you turn a key in a lock or turn a car's steering wheel.</li><li>Gears and wheels turn, and you can turn a screw with a screwdriver. You can also turn by shifting direction or changing position: ""She turned away from him when he started telling terrible jokes."" When you flip the page of a book, you turn that as well. And to transform or change is another way to turn: ""He turned pale when he saw the ghost."" Turn can also be used a noun meaning ""an act or instance of rotating."" And when you play a board game, you roll the dice when it's your turn.</li></ul>"
typical,"<ul><li>When something is typical, it is common, regular, expected — hanging out with friends and playing computer games are typical activities of American teens.</li><li>To be typical is to be of a type, meaning that a person or thing has the same characteristics of everyone or everything else in the group, like a typical student, trying to talk the teacher out of giving homework over break. Something that is typical is what you can expect, like reading a guidebook about a faraway country you will visit to learn the typical weather and kinds of food you will encounter while you are there.</li></ul>"
ubiquitous,"<ul><li>It's everywhere! It's everywhere! When something seems like it's present in all places at the same time, reach for the adjective ubiquitous.</li><li>""Cities like Singapore aim to cloak themselves in ubiquitous, free Wi-Fi in the next few years,"" The Wall Street Journal reported recently — meaning that those savvy Singaporeans will find a wireless connection everywhere they go. The word comes from the Latin ubique, meaning — you guessed it — ""everywhere."" The usual pronunciation is ""yoo-BIK-wih-tihs,"" but Joseph Heller must have had the older variant ""ooh-BIK-wih-tihs"" in mind when he wrote in Catch-22 that a character ""padded through the shadows fruitlessly like an ubiquitous spook.""</li></ul>"
ultimate,"<ul><li>The last in a series can be described as the ultimate. A cheeky kid, when asked what she wants to be when she grows up, might say, ""I want to be an actress, a singer, and a veterinarian, but my ultimate goal is to be President of the United States.""</li><li>A definition for the adjective ultimate is the furthest in space or time or the highest in degree or order. Traveling for business, you are flying first to London, then to Portugal, but your ultimate destination is South Africa. The kids ask you if they can invite friends over to play video games. It's a good idea to reply, ""Mom isn't home from work yet and she's ultimate authority on the schedule.""</li></ul>"
ultimately,"<ul><li>Ultimately means ""at the very end of the process."" Your strategy of robbing banks with a water gun worked a few times, but ultimately it was unsuccessful.</li><li>Use ultimately when you want to stress that there are many different elements of something, but in the end there's one clear conclusion. The city parks department might listen to everyone's ideas for what to do with that empty lot, but ultimately they'll do whatever they think will serve the city best. Ultimately comes from the Latin ultimāre, meaning, lying at the very end.</li></ul>"
unadorned,"<ul><li>Something unadorned has no decorations or frills. It's plain, like a room with nothing on the walls or a person wearing purely functional clothes and no accessories.</li><li>To adorn something is to decorate it or to dress it up. If something is unadorned, it lacks decorations. An unadorned Christmas tree is just a plain old pine tree. If a woman’s face is unadorned, she’s not wearing makeup. The unadorned truth is the plain truth, with no nonsense. This word means about the same as undecorated, and it can often mean dull. But that’s a matter of taste.</li></ul>"
unanimity,"<ul><li>When there is unanimity, everyone agrees. When it comes to opinion, unanimity is the opposite of disagreement.</li><li>Unanimity is a word for a group of people all being of one mind. If everyone in the country voted for the same person for president, that would be complete unanimity. Just like uniforms make people look alike, this similar word indicates people are thinking alike. Unanimity doesn't happen often, because people tend to disagree about everything. When there is disagreement, there's no unanimity.</li></ul>"
unconsolidated,
undergo,"<ul><li>Undergo means ""endure until something is complete."" You might undergo testing to check your hearing or undergo special training if you want to volunteer at a homeless shelter.</li><li>The verb undergo means ""experience"" or ""undertake."" It is often used to describe medical procedures, such as, an injured quarterback who will undergo shoulder surgery. The word implies that it is something that has to happen so that a positive change occurs, like healing in the case of the quarterback or greater communication skills for a hot-tempered person who undergoes anger management training.</li></ul>"
underlie,"<ul><li>While it’s true that when something underlies something else, it is beneath it, this does not necessarily mean subservience — it can also indicate a strong foundation or bedrock that underlies, or supports, an idea or decision.</li><li>The Old English word underlicgan meant to serve or submit to another, and that meaning does carry through to the modern word underlie — to a point. Although still referring to something under something else, around 1850 the meaning of the verb shifted to include something that makes a foundation for something else. For example, one factor that underlies a patient's unusual symptoms might be his recent trip to a foreign country, where he could have picked up a local infection.</li></ul>"
underlying,"<ul><li>The obvious meaning of underlying refers to something beneath something else. But the word carries a more subtle meaning, that of something hidden but important, something that shapes the meaning or effect of something else, without being explicit itself.</li><li>Consider the adjective underlying as referring to a ""subtext,"" which is something hidden. An example is sarcasm, when a person says one thing but means the opposite. In theater, an actor develops subtext for his or her character to establish an underlying reason for what that character says and does. Life is full of underlying reasons we do things. Worry over a grandparent's illness might be the underlying reason a child fails a test. (Then again, maybe she just didn't study.)</li></ul>"
underpinning,
underrate,"<ul><li>To underrate something is to underestimate its value. If critics underrate a great movie, they don't give it enough credit for its brilliant acting and well-written script.</li><li>If most people underrate the Polish restaurant in your neighborhood, they'll be pleasantly surprised once they give it a try. High school football players tend to underrate the importance of gracefulness in their sport, and your math teacher may underrate the amount of time it takes you to do your calculus homework. The verb underrate has been around since the 1640's, although back then it was generally spelled with a hyphen: under-rate.</li></ul>"
underscore,"<ul><li>To underscore is to draw special attention to a fact, idea, or situation. When you're involved in a debate, it’s wise to underscore the points that best support your argument.</li><li>Literally, underscore means “to underline,” or draw a line beneath a word to emphasize it. In common speech, to underscore something is to call attention to it. If a worker sustained an injury on the job, for instance, the event would underscore the need for workplace safety. Underscore is also used to mean  ""emphasize."" During a job interview, you want to underscore any experience that relates to the job you are applying for.</li></ul>"
undertake,"<ul><li>When you undertake a task or challenge, you attempt to accomplish it. If you want to undertake a verbal challenge right now, try saying “sushi chef” ten times quickly without messing up.</li><li>Way back in the 13th century, undertake meant “seize” or “entrap.” Of course, the meaning has shifted significantly since then, and we hope you don’t feel entrapped when you decide to undertake a project. However, undertake does convey a level of commitment and involvement that’s somewhat stronger than the words try or attempt might suggest.</li></ul>"
undertaking,"<ul><li>Painting a house is a serious undertaking––it looks simple but involves a lot of preparation and hard work. An undertaking is a job or a task you commit to. The word also can mean the profession of funeral management.</li><li>When you take something under consideration, it means you're not necessarily going to do it, you're just going to think about it. When you take something on, you've undertaken to actually do it. The word undertaking suggests something that involves quite a bit of work. Organizing an Oxfam hunger-day at your school is a significant undertaking, but it's worth all the effort.</li></ul>"
uneasy,"<ul><li>Uneasy describes an uncomfortable feeling. You might feel socially uneasy when dining with your girlfriend's parents if they don't like you very much. Your stomach may also feel uneasy at that same dinner and gurgle in an embarrassing way.</li><li>The adjective uneasy has many shades of meaning, most involving mild discomfort. It can refer to a lack of a sense of security. If McDonald's and Burger King team up to develop a new sandwich, that would be an uneasy alliance, because neither side would fully trust the other. Uneasy can also describe causing someone to feel anxious or nervous. If you see someone staring at you mumbling, ""That's him, that's the one,"" you might feel uneasy.</li></ul>"
uniform,"<ul><li>Uniform means the same. If your school has a uniform it means all the kids wear the same clothes. If you are told to make your handwriting uniform, they want your letters to be the same shape and size over and over.</li><li>When you break uniform down, you'll see uni for one, and form, for shape––things that are uniform have the shape. If you are building a Zombie Army, it's more fun to create zombies who are not uniform. Some can wear shredded shrouds, others can wear whatever they find. Some walk just fine, others leave body parts wherever they go.</li></ul>"
unintendedly,
uninterrupted,
unique,"<ul><li>If something is unique, it's the only one around. You might think getting a nose ring would make you unique, until you see five other people on the street with the same piercing.</li><li>If someone calls you unique you know that you are very special. The reason is that the Latin prefix uni- means ""one."" (Technically speaking, it isn't possible to be ""very unique"" — you either are or you're not.) Think of the prefix in unicorn for a creature with one horn and unicycle for a cycle with one wheel.</li></ul>"
unique to,
universally,"<ul><li>Use the adverb universally to emphasize that something is done — or felt, or believed — in every single case.</li><li>If your new haircut is universally loved, it means that everyone, everywhere — with no exceptions — is a fan of your super short bangs. You might also describe getting a filling at the dentist as universally disliked, or a brilliant sunny day as universally cheering after a week of rain. The root is Latin, the word universalis, ""of or belonging to all,"" which in turn comes from universus, ""whole or entire."" When a feeling or belief belongs to everyone, everywhere, it is held universally.</li></ul>"
unleash,"<ul><li>When you remove your dog's leash so she can run wildly across the beach, you unleash her — you set her loose. And when you unleash a storm of insults against your brother, you allow them to flow freely from your lips.</li><li>There are two ways to use the verb unleash. Literally, it means ""set loose,"" like when a police officer unleashes her trained dog to sniff luggage for illegal drugs, or a farmer unleashes her llama after moving it into a pen. Figuratively, you can unleash all kinds of emotions, forces, opinions, and actions. Unhappy citizens might unleash a series of high-profile protests, or a barrage of shouted demands, for example.</li></ul>"
unprecedented,"<ul><li>Something that is unprecedented is not known, experienced, or done before. If you've never gone on a family beach vacation but you're planning one now, you could refer to it as an unprecedented decision.</li><li>The root of this word is precedent, a noun referring to something done or said that is used as an example to be followed in the future. In law, a precedent is a legal decision that is used as a standard in future cases. So the adjective unprecedented, meaning ""having no precedent,"" was formed from the prefix un- ""not,"" the noun precedent, and the suffix –ed ""having.""</li></ul>"
unqualified,"<ul><li>If you're unqualified for something, you're not cut out to do it, often because you don't have the skills or knowledge you need. A dog trainer is most likely unqualified to perform brain surgery.</li><li>The adjective unqualified is good for describing someone who isn't fit for a task or job. You wouldn't want an unqualified dentist to fill your cavity, and an unqualified babysitter might not even know how to change a diaper or put a bandage on a scraped elbow. Another way people can be unqualified is when they lack some necessary document — you're unqualified to teach in a public school, for example, without a state teaching certificate.</li></ul>"
unreceptive,
unresolved,"<ul><li>The word unresolved may describe an argument that has not been solved, a question that remains unanswered, or a decision that has not been made — like the title of ""Checkers Champion"" after a tie game.</li><li>The word unresolved is used for a situation that lacks a resolution, or ending. It can also describe unaddressed emotions, such as anger or sadness, as in the unresolved issues you have toward your hamster ever since it bit your finger. The word unresolved can also be used to describe musical dissonance — if you hear a chord in a symphony that makes you think the song isn’t over, the chord is probably unresolved.</li></ul>"
unrestricted,"<ul><li>When something is unrestricted, it means there are no restrictions placed on it. A restriction is a rule about a way that something can be used.</li><li>If your parents give you a generous allowance with the restriction that a portion of it must be donated to charity and another portion saved, you might end up with less money than a friend who has a smaller, but unrestricted, allowance.</li></ul>"
unsophisticated,
unsuitable,"<ul><li>Something that's unsuitable doesn't work well or is out of place. A kitchen knife is unsuitable for sawing firewood.</li><li>You can use the adjective unsuitable to describe something that isn't well suited for a use: flip flops are unsuitable shoes to wear in a blizzard. It's also a good word for something that's disappointing or undesirable: ""No, that guy in the clown suit would be a completely unsuitable boyfriend for me."" At the root of unsuitable is the meaning of suit, ""be agreeable or convenient,"" that's thought to come from ""provide a suit of clothes.""</li></ul>"
unsurpassed,"<ul><li>Anything unsurpassed is the very best, superior to anything else. If the play you're watching is unsurpassed, you've never seen one that's better.</li><li>When one thing surpasses another, it goes way beyond in quality or achievement, often exceeding what you could've imagined. So if something (or someone) is unsurpassed, it's never been bested — in fact, it's the very greatest. This adjective is great for accomplishments that have never been outdone, like soccer star Pelé's unsurpassed record of the most World Cup wins.</li></ul>"
unwieldy,"<ul><li>If you see an unwieldy person coming down the aisle of the bus with an unwieldy box, you may want to step aside because that's a double dose of clumsy. It's an awkward person carrying a box that is difficult to manage.</li><li>Something that is wieldy is easy to control or handle, so something unwieldy is not. However, the un- form of the word is much more common. The base word wieldy has its roots in Old English, meaning ""to handle or control"" — used usually in reference to a weapon. You would not want an unwieldy person attempting to wield an unwieldy sword!</li></ul>"
urbane,"<ul><li>Urbane people are sophisticated, polished, cultured, refined. Spend enough time in an urban setting–-going to concerts and museums, spending time in crowds––and you'll be urbane too.</li><li>Both urbane and urban derive from the Latin urbanus, ""city,"" but while urban has connotations of gritty living and crime, urbane assumes that everyone sees the city from the roof deck of their penthouse apartment, drinking champagne and exchanging bon mots with friends. Add a Cole Porter soundtrack and the image is complete.</li></ul>"
utilitarian,"<ul><li>The adjective utilitarian describes something that is useful or functional. If you are attracted to a car for its storage space and gas mileage — as opposed to its sparkly tire rims — then chances are you value a car's utilitarian features.</li><li>The word utilitarian was coined by the philosopher and judge Jeremy Bentham, who argued that his principle of utility would create the ""greatest happiness for the greatest number of people."" The noun form of utilitarian refers to a person who adheres to this philosophy of usefulness. ""They couldn't agree on the decor for their living room. She wanted whimsy — delicate tables, fragile statues of fairies and unicorns, and cushions on the floor to sit on. He wanted something more utilitarian and useful — comfortable chairs, a giant TV, and sturdy tables to put your feet on.""</li></ul>"
utterly,"<ul><li>Utterly is an intensifying word: something utterly delicious is very, very delicious.</li><li>One thing people love to do is exaggerate. You often hear people talking about how awesome or awful things are. When you're laying it on thick, utterly is an utterly useful word: it means something similar to completely, totally, or very. Something utterly disappointing is extremely disappointing. Something utterly wonderful is wonderful times ten. When you get tired of writing very, utterly is a good word choice.</li></ul>"
vagary,"<ul><li>A vagary is an unexpected and unpredictable change, and the word is usually used in the plural. You might know from experience that the vagaries of winter weather make planning a vacation in February a risky proposition.</li><li>Vagary traces back to the Latin root meaning ""wander,"" and you can think of a vagary as something that wanders. Events or situations that seem to change at random have vagaries. Whether the hottest new boy band will succeed or not is dependent on the vagaries of teenage enthusiasms. The  vagaries of the real estate market will determine whether that swamp property you just bought is a gold mine or a disaster.</li></ul>"
vaguely,"<ul><li>Vaguely describes action that is unclear. If you vaguely recall meeting someone once before, you barely remember him or her, what you talked about, or even where you met.</li><li>The adverb vaguely probably comes from the Latin word vagus, which means “wandering,” or “uncertain.” Its origin is unclear, which is fitting for a word that means ""mistily."" If you don't want to go to your friend's tuba recital, you can say vaguely, ""I think I might have something else to do that night. But if I don't, I'll try to make it.""</li></ul>"
vanish,"<ul><li>A car driving into the distance, a member of a near-extinct species, or that last piece of pecan pie in the refrigerator — any of these things is likely to vanish soon, meaning ""to disappear.""</li><li>The word vanish entered English by way of French, but it can be traced back to the Latin word  evanescere, meaning to “die away” or “to dissipate.” The word covers all kinds of disappearing acts, from the  disappearance of an object or a person. You might, for example, vanish from school when the last bell rings on Friday. Things we can't see can also vanish, like the stress that vanishes when your big project is complete.</li></ul>"
variability,"<ul><li>The weather in San Francisco is known for its variability. One minute it's summer and the next, winter. Variability means the tendency to shift or change — of being ""variable.""</li><li>There are many words that contain vari-, and they almost all have to do with change or difference. Variability is the noun version of this idea. The variability of the weather means that you never know exactly what to wear. T-shirt or sweater: the choices vary along with the weather. Many things are known for their variability: the taste of teenagers, the talent of the singers on ""American Idol,"" Frank Sinatra's moods. These are just some of the things that exhibit real variability.</li></ul>"
variation,"<ul><li>Variation means a deviation from the norm, like the variation of colors in nature.</li><li>A variation from an accepted standard can be very important. For example, a variation in a heartbeat pattern can tell a doctor that a heart attack might be imminent. The variation in weather temperatures from what is expected indicates that our climate is changing due to global warming. But not all variation is a bad thing. For example, even within breeds, there is a wide variation in the coloration of dogs, a trait that makes each puppy uniquely lovable.</li></ul>"
varied,"<ul><li>Something is varied when it covers a wide range of things. If you start out eating eggs in the morning, then have a snack of sushi, then pizza for lunch, fresh fruit with your tea, and a beef stew for dinner, you have a varied diet.</li><li>The word varied comes from vary, which means ""to change, alter."" Think of varied as describing something that has many altered forms or has been changed often. There are many varied ideas on how to improve the economy. The artist has painted in varied styles as his interests have changed. And a varied workout routine will keep you from getting bored.</li></ul>"
vast,"<ul><li>If you’re in a boat out on the water and you can’t see any land, then the body of water you’re in is probably vast, or enormous.</li><li>Things that are described as vast include oceans, seas, the heavens, deserts, and the surface of the moon. Even places that can't be seen or touched, like imaginations, are called vast, because of the endless ideas that come out of them. Someone with a vast imagination is very creative, and a place with a vast landscape is very large. Possibilities are vast, and so are the vocabularies of the world, filling vast volumes.</li></ul>"
vastly,
vehicle,"<ul><li>A vehicle gets you or your stuff where it needs to go. Even though the grocery store is only a few block away, you'll probably want to use a vehicle to get there, so you won't have to carry your groceries all the way home.</li><li>A vehicle is anything that transports a person or thing, usually a car. But a vehicle can be a truck, a plane, a bus, a blimp or even a shopping cart, anything that transports people or things. Vehicle is also often used in the sense of a medium of expression. For example, if you're an artist, your art is the vehicle for your creative ideas. Some people believe that bread is just a vehicle for mayonnaise.</li></ul>"
versatile,"<ul><li>To describe a person or thing that can adapt to do many things or serve many functions, consider the adjective versatile.</li><li>In E.B. White's classic children's book Charlotte's Web, Charlotte the spider tells Wilbur the pig that she is versatile. ""What does 'versatile' mean — full of eggs?"" Wilbur asks. ""Certainly not,"" Charlotte replies. ""'Versatile' means I can turn with ease from one thing to another."" Charlotte knew her etymology, because the word reflects its Latin root, versatilis, ""turning around; revolving."" It eventually came to describe someone who is multi-talented: a singer-songwriter-actress-model would be a versatile figure in the entertainment world.</li></ul>"
via,
viability,"<ul><li>The noun viability means the quality of being able to happen or having a reasonable chance of success. The viability of holding your party at a restaurant might depend on how many guests they can seat.</li><li>Viability comes from the Latin root vita, meaning ""life."" So the noun viability also refers to something's capacity to live and grow. When your dog has a litter of puppies, you can't help wondering about the viability of the tiniest one, but if you feed him with an eyedropper and keep him warm, he might make it.</li></ul>"
vial,"<ul><li>The word vial sounds like another word, ""vile"" (making them homonyms), but they mean completely different things. A vial is just a small glass bottle that contains a chemical or drug. ""Vile"" is evil.</li><li>One of the coolest things about the English language is how specific you can get. For example, got a small glass bottle made for carrying chemicals or drugs? There's a word for that! That word is vial. There are bottles for soda and bottles for beer, but if what you're carrying is drugs, chemicals, or similar substances, you're carrying them in a vial.</li></ul>"
vibrant,"<ul><li>Vibrant colors are bright. Vibrant sounds are loud and resonant. Vibrant people are ones you remember — they're bright and full of personality.</li><li>Vibrant was originally intended to describe sounds. Sound waves vibrate, and when they vibrate more rapidly, they sound brighter. Singers and string instrument players increase this effect by shaking the notes they play through a technique called vibrato that increases the vibrancy of their sound.</li></ul>"
vicinity,"<ul><li>If something is in your vicinity, it's in the surrounding area or nearby region — it's in the neighborhood, so to speak. If there's a garbage dump in your vicinity, you'll certainly smell it.</li><li>The noun vicinity evolved from the Latin vicinitas, which means “of or pertaining to neighbors or a neighborhood.” Not until 1796 did the word expand in meaning to also describe a “surrounding district.” Said American author Washington Irving, “A kind heart is a fountain of gladness, making everything in its vicinity freshen into smiles.” Slang for vicinity include neck of the woods and turf.</li></ul>"
vigor,"<ul><li>If your new puppy runs all over the house, jumps on the furniture, and enthusiastically chews up your socks,  you may congratulate yourself on your new pup's vigor, or lively sense of energy.</li><li>Aside from mental or physical vitality, the noun vigor can be applied to an imaginative style of thought or expression and also to a forceful intensity. ""The jury was not only willing to acquit the defendant, but also nominate him for sainthood, by the time his attorney had delivered, with vigor, an impassioned plea for his client's innocence.""</li></ul>"
vigorous,"<ul><li>Anything vigorous is done with force and energy. Vigorous exercise makes you sweat, and a vigorous denial makes someone else sweat.</li><li>Vigorous is a description for something strong or enthusiastic. It comes from the French word vigour, meaning ""liveliness, activity."" An active, physically energetic person is vigorous, and mental activities can be vigorous too, when they require a lot of mental effort. A vigorous argument doesn’t have to include physical wrestling; it just might involve verbal sparring.</li></ul>"
virtually,"<ul><li>Use the adjective virtually to mean almost. If your economics homework is nearly complete, it is virtually done.</li><li>Virtually also means in essence, or for all intents and purposes. If you virtually ran the German club bake sale by yourself, it means that even though you weren't officially in charge, you might as well have been. In computer science, the word virtually has the extended sense of being part of the simulated computer world. Your character in a computer game might excel virtually at sports even though you're not particularly athletic in real life.</li></ul>"
virtue,"<ul><li>Virtue is the quality of being morally good. If you're writing a screenplay and you want it to be a real tearjerker, make sure your hero is full of virtue.</li><li>The word virtue comes from the Latin root vir, for man. At first virtue meant manliness or valor, but over time it settled into the sense of moral excellence. Virtue can also mean excellence in general. One of your virtues might be your generous willingness to help out your friends. The phrase by virtue of means ""as a result of"" or ""by authority of."" You will achieve success by virtue of hard work (or by virtue of inside connections).</li></ul>"
visual barrier,
vital,"<ul><li>A patient's vital signs are their important body functions, such as pulse rate, that shows they are still alive. Use the adjective vital to describe something that is important and necessary, or a person full of energy.</li><li>Vital descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Latin vītālis, from vīta, ""life."" If you are vital to the organization you work for, it means they cannot live without you — or at least that you're an important part of the team. If you're a vital force in your church volunteer group, you probably are a leader with lots of energy to give.</li></ul>"
vivid,"<ul><li>Vivid is an adjective that describes a bold and bright color, an intense feeling, or an image in your mind that is so clear you can almost touch it.</li><li>Sometimes you have a vivid dream that feels so real that even when you wake up, you can’t tell if the dream is really over.  In that dream, perhaps there were flowers with deep, rich, and vivid colors that looked like they were painted.  Vivid comes from the Latin vivere, which means “to live,” and vivid memories do seem to live on.</li></ul>"
volume,<ul><li>Volume can mean how much space something takes up. You could measure a bean's volume by placing it in water and measuring the water's rise.</li><li>You can also use volume as you measure sound or the number of books in a series. Your mom might demand that you turn down the volume on your stereo as she reaches for the next volume of Dante's Divine Comedy. She would rather read about Hell in silence.</li></ul>
vulnerable,"<ul><li>Use the adjective vulnerable to describe something or someone open to being physically or emotionally wounded, like a newborn chick or an overly sensitive teenager.</li><li>Vulnerable is from Latin and is based on vulnus, ""wound."" From its literal meaning, it has come to be more often used for someone who is easily hurt or likely to succumb to temptation. It's best used for a person whose feelings are so delicate that they can't withstand any criticism or pressure: ""Don't speak harshly to her, she's very vulnerable today.""</li></ul>"
wanting,"<ul><li>If something's wanting, there's not enough of something necessary in it. If your essay is wanting, it's missing something important and won't get an A. Try adding body paragraphs.</li><li>If you forget the sugar in your chocolate chip cookies, you'll find them wanting when you taste them. Likewise, if your favorite team's defense is wanting, they're likely to lose the basketball game. Wanting, which was originally wantand, comes from the verb want, ""to be lacking."" This definition pre-dated the now more common ""to wish for"" by 500 years.</li></ul>"
warrant,"<ul><li>If you watch cop shows, you know that a warrant is something police need to get into your house — a permission slip from a judge.</li><li>It's a noun! It's a verb! It's a word that warrants our attention! As a noun, it's the piece of paper they show you through the keyhole during an investigation. It's also a reason for doing something, or a promise (think of the warranty on your new car, the promise that it'll work for a certain amount of time). As a verb, it means to make something seem reasonable or necessary, such as when the ticking suitcase warrants bringing in the bomb squad, or when the teenager's sneaking in late again warrants a stricter curfew.</li></ul>"
wary,"<ul><li>Describe yourself as wary if you don't quite trust someone or something and want to proceed with caution. Be wary of risky things like wild mushrooms and Internet deals!</li><li>You can trace wary through Old English back to Old High German giwar ""aware, attentive."" If you keep a wary eye on something, you are attentive for signs that it is becoming dangerous. Likewise, if you give someone a wary glance, your face conveys the suspicion and caution you feel. When you are wary of driving alone at night or making promises, you fear something bad might happen if you do these things.</li></ul>"
way,"<ul><li>The means by which you go about doing something is the way you do it. Although you ""cleaned"" your room, the way you did it — shoving everything into your closet — didn't exactly solve the problem.</li><li>Your manner of behavior or how you usually conduct yourself is also called your way. If it's not your way to let someone be bullied, you'll stand up for kids being pushed around, even if the bully is twice your size. A road or path can also be called a way. The Queen Elizabeth Way is a highway in Ontario, Canada, for example.</li></ul>"
whatever,
whereas,
whereby,
while,"<ul><li>While describes a length of time. If you were describing a first date, you might say, ""We sat there for a while in an incredibly awkward silence.""</li><li>Use the word while to talk about an unspecific period of time, like when you ask your friend if you can borrow his notebook for a while. While is also a conjunction that describes things that happen at the same time, like crying while watching a very sad movie. The Old English root of while, hwil, is interesting because the w and the h are switched, but the meaning is the same: a space of time.</li></ul>"
whole,"<ul><li>Something that exists in its entirety is whole. If there are eight slices of pizza and you eat half, you've eaten four of them. If you eat the whole pizza, you've somehow managed to eat all eight slices.</li><li>In terms of mental or physical health, whole describes someone who is healthy or uninjured. It might take you a while after a traumatic experience to feel whole again. Whole siblings are brothers and sisters who share both parents (as opposed to half siblings, who have only one parent in common). All the parts of an object taken collectively make up the whole of that object.</li></ul>"
wholly,"<ul><li>Wholly is an adverb that means ""entirely."" If a story is wholly inaccurate, no part of it is true.</li><li>Do you like to do things the whole way or whole hog, refusing any halfhearted attempts? Then wholly is your kind of word — it means completely, totally, or to the full extent. To give yourself over wholly to the music at a concert means that you are focused exclusively on the experience. If you're wholly committed to a goal, you're going to give it 100% of your time and energy.</li></ul>"
wield,"<ul><li>If you wield a tool or a weapon, you handle it effectively. Picture a gallant knight wielding a sword or a skillful chef wielding a whisk.</li><li>You don't just have to wield something physical; you can also wield or exert influence or authority. Wield is frequently followed by the word power. If you were a king, you could wield great power in your kingdom — exerting your influence over everything from food rations to castle upkeep. As it is, though, you might just wield power over your pet goldfish. Note: wield follows the i before e, except after c spelling rule.</li></ul>"
with respect to,
within,"<ul><li>Use the adverb within when you need to say that something is on the inside. If you find that the door to your brother’s room is locked from within, that means it’s locked from the inside and he really doesn't want you to enter.</li><li>Within often refers to something on the inside of an object or structure — like those screams coming from within the haunted house. You can also use the word more figuratively to describe something that’s in your soul or mind — something that’s internal. For example, you might feel a fire within you as you start getting excited about playing in the big game.</li></ul>"
withstand,"<ul><li>In the story of the three little pigs, only the house made of brick was able to withstand the huffing and puffing of the Big Bad Wolf. To withstand is to hold up against something strong.</li><li>Withstand means to stand your ground against a powerful and negative force. A lot of toys can withstand rough treatment, but CDs definitely can't. And hopefully, you can withstand the pressures of school and work! If you can withstand a lot of criticism, it means you can take it without giving up.</li></ul>"
witness,"<ul><li>If you're walking down the street and see one car run a red light and plow into another, you are a witness to the accident. You saw it and can tell someone else how the accident happened.</li><li>The first part of a witness's role is observation. You witness the accident. The second part is telling someone about it — bearing witness. In court, you can be a witness for the defense or prosecution. You can also witness a legal document, like a will, or a wedding conducted by the justice of the peace. Religious people use this word a lot too: being a witness in that sense is being a true believer who tries to convert others.</li></ul>"
yearly,
yearning,"<ul><li>A yearning is a strong desire. If you have a yearning to travel in Africa, it means that you dream about it and intensely hope that one day you'll end up there.</li><li>A strong longing for something is a yearning for it. If you have a yearning for ice cream, it probably means that you've gone a long time without any and are almost desperate to taste some. The Old English root of the words yearn and yearning is georn, which means ""eager or desirous.""</li></ul>"
yet,"<ul><li>Yet can introduce a contrast, refer to the future, or to something that you need more of. You can like a class, yet feel it's too hard. You may need to study hard yet again to try to pass a re-test. And even if an exam hasn't happened yet, you might worry it will be a disaster.</li><li>Yet is often used like but when connecting two ideas that contrast — as in, ""I love apples, yet I hate applesauce."" When yet is not being used as a contrast, it means ""more"" or ""in the future"" (which is really just more time). If you've been rehearsing for the school play for weeks, but still don't know your lines, you'll need yet more rehearsals if it's going to be a success.</li></ul>"
yield,"<ul><li>Yield has two meanings that seem quite different: ""an amount"" or ""to give way."" The yield of the recipe was twelve brownies. To avoid being tripped, Mary was forced to yield to the children on her way to the brownie plate.</li><li>While these meanings seem quite different, they both essentially mean ""to give."" The recipe gives twelve brownies to those who follow it, and Mary is giving up her right to go first. Yield can also mean the rate of return on an investment. A bond yields an interest rate of 2%, or gives an investor $2.00 for every $100 invested.</li></ul>"
zenith,"<ul><li>Zenith means the high point — it comes from astronomy, where it describes the highest point in an arc traveled by a star or a planet or another celestial body. The sun reaches its zenith when it is as high in the sky as it is going to go on that day.</li><li>Zenith — and its opposite, nadir — have been appropriated by non-astronomers and are used to describe high and low points in non-astronomical contexts. For example, you can say that the high school quarterback hit his zenith in high school, and it was all downhill from there. Do yourself a favor and try to delay your zenith so you'll have something to look forward to in your future!</li></ul>"
rupture,"<ul><li>A rupture is a break or tear in something that pulls it apart. A rupture can be a literal break, like the one that happens in, say, a gas line, or it can be more figurative, as in a friendship or a business deal.</li><li>The oil spill was less of a spill than it was a rupture: the line leading to the well was severed, allowing the oil to flow into the ocean. Rupture works as both a noun and a verb. You can rupture the silence by screaming your head off, and any number of events in Star Trek can cause a rupture in the space-time continuum.</li></ul>"
revere,"<ul><li>Revere means to respect someone so deeply that you almost worship them. Many Americans revere civil rights activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, who worked to make the country a more just place.</li><li>Revere is related to the words reverence (""to hold something in worshipful awe"") and its opposite — irreverent. Reverence for the irreverent is actually possible. Howard Stern humor is often vulgar and absurdly irreverent yet his legions of fans and even some media analysts revere him and his ability to maintain a loyal audience. Revere is the perfect word when respect is not strong enough but worship seems a little too religious-sounding. Rock stars, for example, are revered by throngs of devoted fans.</li></ul>"
supplementary,"<ul><li>Supplementary is a little something extra to fill in a gap, like when your teacher suggests supplementary reading material that you may or may not get around to checking out.</li><li>Supplementary can be an important part of something or just extra support. The word supplement comes from the Latin supplementum for ""something added to fix a deficiency"" and the suffix -ary means ""connected with."" Put them together and you have something connected with filling in. The supplementary support of digging a moat around your sand castle might save it from a wave, but that supplementary reading on your syllabus isn't required (although it might save your grade).</li></ul>"
had priority,
uniformly,
exceeding,"<ul><li>The adjective exceeding comes from the verb to exceed, which means ""go beyond."" The massage was given with exceeding care — it was worth every cent.</li><li>A parent feels exceeding pride at the graduation of a kid. You might also say that they feel ""extra,"" if that helps to clue you into the meaning of exceeding, but it does have a slightly different meaning. If you were to have ""extra"" pride, then you'd have more than you needed. You might give the ""extra"" to someone else. To feel exceeding pride, though, means to have more than you might have expected. It's another way of saying something is exceptional in whatever way you mean.</li></ul>"
proper,"<ul><li>Something proper is correct or right. There's a proper fork to use for salad, and a proper way to dress for a wedding.</li><li>Things that are proper fit the situation — they're the right thing to do, because of custom or manners. A swear word is the opposite of proper language. Wearing a hat indoors isn't proper, as your grandparents have probably reminded you. Getting proper medical care means you've received the appropriate medical care. When things are proper, they're correct and suitable: they fit.</li></ul>"
transform,"<ul><li>When you transform you change from one thing or state to another. Picture a transformer that changes from a robot to a car. Simple, right?</li><li>Caterpillars transform into butterflies, a forest is transformed by a snowfall, and a city can be transformed by a new government or a changing economy. Transform means a big change in appearance or  in essence. The Internet has transformed how we live our day-to-day lives, but you wouldn't say that moving a throw pillow has transformed your living room.</li></ul>"
persistent,"<ul><li>If something is persistent, it just won't stop. If you're persistent in your suggestions for a trip to Mexico, maybe your parents will eventually give in and take you there.</li><li>Persistent comes from the Latin verb persistere which means ""to continue with strength."" A persistent salesman refuses to give up. A persistent ringing sound is one that repeats and repeats. Persistent rumors keep circulating, as does a persistent virus. Often something persistent is annoying. The related verb is persist, which means to continue to exist, or to go without stopping.</li></ul>"

تنظیمات مرور انکی,
akin,"<ul><li>If two things are akin, then they're similar or related. A cupcake is akin to a cake and relatives are akin to each other.</li><li>If you know the word kin — a relative — then you have a clue to the meaning of akin. People who are related are akin, but the word goes beyond blood relations. Football is akin to the sport of rugby; baseball is akin to the British sport cricket. Mice are akin to rats, and rats are akin to gerbils, hamsters, and squirrels. Things that are akin are alike.</li></ul>"
conjunction,"<ul><li>""Conjunction Junction, what's your function? Hooking up words and phrases and clauses."" These lyrics from Schoolhouse Rock sum it up: a conjunction is all about joining things together.</li><li>The words and, but, and or are conjunctions, linking words and phrases together to form sentences. Other kinds of conjunctions bring groups together, such as organizations working in conjunction to present a big event; or bring objects together, like a conjunction in a house's plumbing system where pipes meet. Conjunction could also mean things happening at the same time, such as free Schoolhouse Rock screenings that are presented in conjunction with a National Grammar Day celebration.</li></ul>"
contribute,"<ul><li>To contribute something is to provide a part of the whole. When your company has their annual softball game and potluck picnic, you will probably be asked to contribute a dish, like your famous macaroni salad.</li><li>Contribute comes from a Latin word that means “to bring together, add, or unite.”  When you contribute to a cause, you are adding to what other people have kicked in, which makes the effort complete.  You can contribute your singing talent to a traveling a cappella group; you can contribute money or time to save rhinoceroses; you can contribute cupcakes to the gymnastics team bake sale; or you can even contribute ideas on healthcare reform to a Washington think tank.</li></ul>"
embrace,"<ul><li>To embrace something is to welcome it with open arms, hold, hug, accept completely. You might embrace your sweetheart, or even changes in technology.</li><li>Embrace is from the French verb embrasser, which started out meaning  ""to clasp in the arms"" (but now includes kissing). You embrace someone by giving her a giant hug, and when you embrace a new idea, it's like your brain gives it a hug. The noun and verb form are similar: If you embrace someone who isn't your sweetheart, you might get caught in an embrace. In Henry IV, Shakespeare writes about a really, really tight embrace: ""I will embrace him with a soldier's arm/That he shall shrink under my courtesy.""</li></ul>"
